CONFIDENTIALITY.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY</strong>
</p>
<p>

(b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction.

</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2</strong> The Zendesk Group will maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Service Data, as described in the Agreement, the Supplemental Terms entitled, “How We Protect Service Data” attached hereto, and Supplemental Terms for the Deployed Associated Services, as applicable.

Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Zendesk, Service Data may be hosted by the Zendesk Group or their respective authorized third-party service providers in the United States, the EEA or other locations around the world.
In providing the Services, Zendesk will engage entities within the Zendesk Group and other authorized service providers, to Process Service Data, including and without limitation, any associated Personal Data pursuant to this Agreement within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the United States and in other countries and territories.
Under no circumstances will any entity in the Zendesk Group be deemed a data controller with respect to Service Data under the Directive or any relevant law or regulation of any Member State as defined in the Directive.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> If Your principal location is in the EEA, We will ensure, pursuant to Article 25 of the Directive that, to the extent that any Service Data constitutes Personal Data, if Service Data is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), that such transfer will only take place if: (a) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection.
(b) one of the conditions listed in Article 26(1) of the Directive is satisfied.
or (c) the transfer is via the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss-US Safe Harbor frameworks.

and (b) their agreement to comply with the data transfer restrictions applicable to Personal Data as set forth in Section 3.4.</p>

</li>
<p>

For example, We may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if You log into Our Services through such service or otherwise provide Us with access to information from such service.
Any access that We may have to such information from a third party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service.
By authorizing Us to connect with a third party service, You authorize Us to access and store Your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other Personal Data that the third party service makes available to Us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Agreement and the Zendesk Privacy Policy as in effect from time to time and available here.

</p>
<p>
<strong>6.2</strong> If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade.

</p>
<p>
<strong>6.3</strong> No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan.
Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.4</strong> Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”).

</p>
<p>
<strong>6.6</strong> Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Zendesk Service are billed and processed by Zendesk’s Payment Agent.

</ol>
</li>
<p>  </p>
<li>
<strong>QUALIFIED REFERRALS, COMMISSIONS.</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>“Qualified Referrals”</strong> mean Referrals (a) referred by Partner to Zendesk and who complete the sign-up procedure in accordance with the procedure described in Section 3.2 below.
(b) of whom Zendesk has no record in connection with the Zendesk Service, or who are not, at the time referred to Zendesk by Partner, in any contractual relations or ongoing negotiations with Zendesk in connection with the Zendesk Service.
(c) who accept the Master Agreement and acquire within one hundred (100) days of being referred to Zendesk by Partner, at a Referral’s own discretion and without receiving any monetary or other incentive from Partner, at least monthly subscriptions of any of the following Zendesk Service plan bundles: (i) 2 agents using the Enterprise Plan, (ii) 4 agents using the Professional Plan, or (iii) 8 agents using the Team Plan (each, as described in the Site at https://www.zendesk.com/product/pricing).
and (d) who are not rejected by Zendesk, and make at least one payment to receive the Zendesk Service.
All Referrals will be deemed rejected by Zendesk if they do not become a Qualified Referral within one hundred (100) days of first being submitted to Zendesk by Partner.
On a case by case basis, the Parties may mutually agree in writing (email sufficing) to waive or extend the one hundred (100) day time limit for a particular Referral.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Referral Procedure.</strong>  Each Referral shall be referred to Zendesk by Partner through an online form provided by Zendesk to Partner, which Partner shall fully complete and submit to Zendesk (“Referral Form”).
Upon receiving each Referral Form, Zendesk shall send an email to the Referral’s email address indicated in the Referral Form, detailing the steps to be taken towards registration to receive the Zendesk Service and become a Qualified Referral.
Zendesk shall be responsible for the sales process to all Referrals, subject to the Parties’ continued good-faith cooperation in promoting the sales process to Referral.</li>
<li>
<strong>Commissions.
 </strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Responsibilities.</strong> Zendesk shall collect all fees from Referrals for the Zendesk Service directly from Referrals (“Subscription Fees”).</li>
<li>
<strong>Referral Fees.</strong> Upon a Referral becoming a Qualified Referral, Zendesk shall pay Partner referral fees in arrears at the applicable percentage of the fees listed on Exhibit B (“Referral Fee Percentage”) (excluding any discounts) payable by the Qualified Referral pursuant to their initial order under the Master Agreement for the first year of the associated subscription (“Referral Fees”).
For initial orders that have subscription terms in excess of one (1) year, Referral Fees payable with respect to the first year shall be determined proportionately to the total Subscription Fees payable pursuant to the initial order.
For clarity, Partner shall only receive Referral Fees on a Qualified Referral’s initial order and Referral Fees will accrue and be payable for, at most, one year from the date of becoming a Qualified Referral.
Such Referral Fees shall become payable and be paid to Partner within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar quarter in which Subscription Fees attributed to such Qualified Referrals are paid to Zendesk.
If a Qualified Referral terminates the Service prior to one year after becoming a Qualified Referral, Partner will only receive a pro-rata portion of the Referral Fees for the year in proportion to the Subscription Fees paid by Qualified Referral to Zendesk.
The Referral Fee Percentage for a Qualified Referral shall be calculated at time of payment based on projected annual revenue rate (“ARR”) of Qualified Referral Subscription Fees.
ARR and the corresponding Referral Fee Percentage shall be calculated on a per Qualified Referral basis with the Referral Fee Percentage set in accordance with the ARR of the Qualified Referral.
For each Qualified Referral, Referral Fees to Partner shall be capped at the amounts listed on Exhibit B for the applicable Referral Fee Percentages (“Maximum Payment”).</li>
<li>
<strong>Associated charges.</strong> Partner shall be responsible for payment of all taxes, duties, governmental charges and other like charges levied on the Referral Fees, and Partner shall indemnify, defend and hold Zendesk harmless from and against any claims arising out or relating to all charges emanating from Zendesk’s payment of Referral Fees.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>  
</p>
</li>
<li>

<strong>Initial Term.</strong> This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter (“Initial Term”), unless Zendesk rejects Partner’s application to participate in the Program.</li>

</li>

</p> Zendesk Marketplace Terms of Use
<p>Effective as of December 1, 2016, Zendesk, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zendesk”, “we”, “us” or “our”) have updated these Marketplace Terms of Use.
For a prior version of the Marketplace Terms of Use, click here.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Marketplace (the “Marketplace”), an online marketplace for web or other software services or applications that utilize or interact with the API and integrate with the Service (defined below) (“Applications”).
By visiting the Marketplace, You agree that Your access to and use of the Marketplace and the Applications is governed by the terms and conditions described in these Marketplace Terms of Use (the “Terms”), which You acknowledge represent a binding legal agreement between You and Zendesk.
If You are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company or other organization or deploying or accessing Applications into and with an Account for a Service, You represent that You have the authority to bind that company or organization (including all Agents) to these Terms and to deploy and integrate Applications into and with such Account.
In such case, the terms “You”, “Your” and “Subscriber” will refer to that company or organization.
If You do not have that authority, or if You do not agree with these Terms, You may not use and must leave the Marketplace.
Capitalized terms used in these Terms and not defined herein shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Master Subscription Agreement.</p>
<p>IF YOU USE THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATED APPLICATIONS, YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
THE MARKETPLACE</strong>
</p>
<p>In the Marketplace, You can access, browse and/or deploy Applications for use within Your Account.
Applications include any software, content, services, technology, data and other digital materials included in or made available through an Application that You access or deploy via the Marketplace.
Applications also include any updates, upgrades and other changes thereto and versions thereof that You later access or deploy via the Marketplace.
Zendesk may make some Applications available via the Marketplace at no charge and others for a cost.
As described in these Terms, many of the Applications made available on the Marketplace are provided and licensed to You by third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
ACCESSING AND DEPLOYING APPLICATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.1</strong> After You register for an Application and pay any corresponding fees related to the use of the Application (if any), You may access and/or deploy the Application for Your use in connection with an Account for the Service.
A high speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Marketplace and Applications.
You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Your network to the Marketplace and Applications, including, but not limited to, “browser” software that supports protocols used by Zendesk, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zendesk, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols.
We are not responsible for notifying You of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data, including Service Data, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities (including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Zendesk.
We assume no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this section.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2</strong> You acknowledge that the Marketplace includes listings for Applications that are created, offered, supported and maintained by third parties (“Third Party Developers”) unaffiliated with Zendesk or its Affiliates (“Third Party Applications”).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, and without limiting Section 3.5 below, You acknowledge and agree that: (a) You must use Your own discretion when You access or deploy Third Party Applications through the Marketplace and access Third Party Developer services.
(b) You should read the terms and conditions and privacy policies associated with any Third Party Applications as provided by the applicable Third Party Developer as they will govern Your use of the Third Party Applications.
and (c) Zendesk does not own or control any of these Third Party Developers or the Third Party Applications, and You will not hold Zendesk responsible or liable for any such Third Party Applications or acts or omissions of Third Party Developers, under any circumstances.
Zendesk does not in any way warrant the accuracy, reliability, security, completeness, usefulness, non-infringement, or quality of any Applications (including without limitation the content contained therein), even if an Application complies with the Marketplace guidelines.
You agree that You bear all risks associated with using or relying on Third Party Applications.
If You have any questions about Third Party Applications or the terms that govern the use of the Third Party Applications, You should contact Third Party Developer of the Third Party Application directly.
For clarity, subject to the foregoing, all Third Party Applications are still “Applications” for purposes of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
USE OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON APPLICATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Your use of an Application (including Third Party Applications) will be governed by the terms and conditions of a terms of service agreement between You and the developer and owner of the Application (“App Terms of Service”).

If there is a conflict between the Mandatory Service Terms and App Terms of Service, the Mandatory Service Terms will control.
Third Party Developer has the right to enforce the App Terms of Service, including the Mandatory Service Terms, against You.

<p>(d) You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Application in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the Application, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by Third Party Developer.</p>
<p>(e) Each of You and Third Party Developer shall maintain all rights, title and interest in and to all its respective patents, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights (collectively, “IP Rights”).
