(y) modification of the Service(s) by anyone other than Zendesk or Zendesk Personnel.
or (z) the combination, operation or use of the Service(s) with other hardware or software where a Service would not by itself be infringing.

<p>
<strong>3.
Performance of Consulting Services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Each SOW or Order Form will include reasonable details about Consulting Services, including, at a minimum, the Consulting Fees (defined below) charged and the Consulting Services provided.
Zendesk and Subscriber agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Consulting Services in a timely and professional manner.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2</strong> The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.3</strong> Zendesk will perform the Consulting Services through qualified employees and/or non-employee contractors of Zendesk (“Subcontractors” and together with Zendesk’s employees for the purposes of these Supplemental Terms, “Consulting Services Personnel”).
Subscriber agrees to provide, at no cost to Zendesk, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Zendesk to enable the performance of the Consulting Services (collectively, “Assistance”).
Zendesk, including its Subcontractors, will not be liable for any deficiency in the performance of Consulting Services to the extent such deficiency results from any acts or omissions of Subscriber, including, but not limited to, Subscriber’s failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> In performing the Consulting Services, Zendesk will utilize Consulting Services Personnel as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof.
Subscriber may object to Zendesk’s use of a Subcontractor by specifying its reasonable objection to Zendesk, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Consulting Services Personnel to perform such Consulting Services.

<p>
<strong>3.7</strong> In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW or Order Form (including, but not limited to, any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW or Order Form), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk.
If Zendesk elects to perform such changes to the Consulting Services, the Parties shall work together in good faith to execute a written Change Order.

Each SOW or Order Form providing for time and materials based Consulting Fees will contain a detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (“T&amp;M Estimate”).
Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&amp;M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties.

Upon receiving such amended T&amp;M Estimate, Subscriber will accept or reject the amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T&amp;M Estimate within five (5) business days of delivery, such amended T&amp;M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Consulting Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&amp;M Estimate.
Any amended T&amp;M Estimate which is accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order.</p>
