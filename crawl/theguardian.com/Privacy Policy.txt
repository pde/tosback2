<strong>Using children’s personal data</strong>
<p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13.
Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.
We also note that California law prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless the guardian has authorized the sale.
We comply with this requirement.</p>
<strong>Security of your personal data</strong>
<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction.
You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps.
You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site.
You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us.
Unfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.</p>
<strong>When we share or sell your personal data</strong>
<p>
<em>Within the Guardian group of companies</em>
</p>
<p>Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia.

<p>If you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>
<em>Agencies and authorities if required by law - </em>We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant).

For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.</p>
<p>
<em>Organisation/s that buy any of the Guardian group companies</em> - We may share your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business.
If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.</p>
<p>Any organisations which access your data in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and keep to all data privacy laws that apply.
We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.</p>
<p>These transfers to third parties may constitute “sale” of your personal information under California law.
A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the “California resident - Do not sell” link that is located in the footer of every page.
Third-parties do not sell personal information that has been sold to them by the Guardian unless you have first received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out.
You can read further about your California rights here.
Anyone using the Guardian, our sites, or our apps may manually inspect the sharing, transfer, and sale of their personal data in our cookie policy.</p>
<strong>International data transfers</strong>
<p>Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities.
While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia.
These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.</p>
<strong>How long we keep your personal data</strong>
<p>We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to.
How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy.
For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services.
We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.
If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.
If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.
However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.</p>
<strong>How we may contact you</strong>
<p>
<em>Service communications</em>
</p>
<p>From time to time we may send you service emails, for example, telling you your subscription is coming to an end or thanking you when you contribute or place an order with us.</p>
<p>
<em>Marketing communications and editorial newsletters</em>
</p>
<p>If we have your permission, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and updates.
Depending on your marketing preferences, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post.</p>
<p>We offer a range of editorial newsletters.
You can manage your subscription to these emails through your profile page when you are signed in to your Guardian account.</p>
<p>You can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to “unsubscribe” directly by clicking a link in the email or through your email preferences in the tab “emails and marketing” when you are signed in to your Guardian account.</p>
<p>
<em>Market research</em>
</p>
<p>Sometimes we may contact you for market research purposes, for example about a survey.
You can opt out from being contacted in this way by signing into your Guardian account and going to the tab “emails and marketing”.</p>
<p>
<em>Responding to your queries or complaints</em>
</p>
<p>If you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.</p>
