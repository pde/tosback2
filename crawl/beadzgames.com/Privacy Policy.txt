For example, when you enter information on a web page (e.g., when you complete an online registration form or sign up for a contest), the operator of the website may insert that information into its URL for that or the next page.
This information often appears after a question mark ("?") in the URL, although it can appear in other places.
This means that your name, your address, your email address or similar information you might consider private or personally-identifiable which you enter into a web page sometimes becomes part of a URL that is then transmitted to BeadzGames.com and automatically stored in BeadzGames.com databases.
This can also occur with words, topics, products or phrases you enter into search engines whether those engines are provided by the Service itself or found elsewhere on the Web while using the Service.
BeadzGames.com has no control over what information third-party websites put into their URLs or where they put it, but any information in each URL is collected and stored by BeadzGames.com when you are using the Service.

The product information that BeadzGames.com gathers is logged together with your IP address, BeadzGames.com cookie number, the names of BeadzGames.com business partners that might have additional information about the particular product, and the date and time in a single data string for each web page you visit.
These strings, which we call "shopping paths," may also contain personally-identifiable information.
