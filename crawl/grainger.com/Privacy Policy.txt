 Order Confirmations
<p>Once you submit your order on Grainger.com, you will receive an e-mail order confirmation with final availability and product pricing.
If you do not receive an order confirmation, please follow these instructions:</p>
<p>Check your "junk mail" folder or "spam" folder in your e-mail inbox to make sure that the Grainger order confirmation is not located in these folders.</p>

<strong>Note: </strong>To ensure that future Grainger order confirmations will be delivered to your e-mail inbox, add the e-mail address <strong>customer_care@ic.graingeremail.com</strong> to your address book.
Many anti-spam systems check your e-mail address book to know which senders are allowed to send you e-mail messages.</p>If you are still not receiving order confirmations, be sure to verify your e-mail address on the Contact Information page on Grainger.com.
