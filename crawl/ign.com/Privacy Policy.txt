We discourage users from posting Personal Information in this fashion, and any Personal Information you post to these areas is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

<p>2.
How we collect and use information.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis collects information as described herein.
All information is or may be used as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

or otherwise communicate with us.
We also collect User Information about you offline through telephone or direct mail efforts or from customers, vendors, suppliers, third parties and publicly-available sources.</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may combine Personal Information with Other Information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve the functionality of the Services and our ability to market or advertise to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.
We may also combine information you have provided to us with information obtained from other sources.</p>
<p>Personal Information is used to provide Services to you from Ziff Davis or its partners, which includes, but is not limited to when: (i) we send emails or newsletters offering services or products to you, (ii) you post your personal testimonial alongside other endorsements, (iii) we display your personal reviews of products or services, or (iv) you to search for other website members using information you may already know about that member such as username, full name or gamer profile and identify users matching that criteria.
Personal Information may also be used to send you advertisements and promotions on the Services and on third party channels.
Personal Information you provide to us is used in a way that is compatible with the Services and this Privacy Policy.
Some of the Services use Personal Information of a registered user to “pre-populate” online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional information about you by the Services or on behalf of a third party.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to send an article to a contact or to invite a contact to become a member of a website, we will ask you for your contact’s email address or allow you to import your contacts from your email account’s address book.
We will automatically send your contact a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.
We may collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and will only use that information for that purpose.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis and its partners use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer Services, track users’ movements around the Services and on third party sites, devices and applications, and to gather demographic information about our user base.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Services. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.

<p>Tracking technologies on the Services may be deployed by Ziff Davis and/or by our service providers or partners.
Certain tracking technologies enable us to assign a unique identifier to you, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your User Information.
We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including from third parties), including, but not limited to, demographic information and updated contact information for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content and advertising.</p>
<p>When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information, and/or aggregate with other data we collect for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We and our partners (including e-commerce partners, affiliates, and analytics providers) may also use technologies such as pixel tags, e-tags, IP addresses, Local Shared Objects, Local Storage, Flash cookies and HTML5 to analyze trends.

collect and store information such as user settings, anonymous browser identifiers and video viewing history.
supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement.
track users’ location and movements around the Services.
gather demographic information about our user base.
and to improve our understanding of traffic on the Services, visitor behavior, and responses to promotional campaigns.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these third party companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
For example, we may connect information about your IP address to known corporate or other information or User Information and use the associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market services to you or the originating corporation(s).
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage.
To manage Flash Local Shared Objects please click here.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to collect data and to better understand the functionality of our mobile software, devices and applications on your phone and other devices.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We may link this information to User Information.</p>
<p>The Services include certain social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, which include the “Share” button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Services.
These features may collect your IP address, track which page you are visiting on the Services, and may serve a cookie to enable the features to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p>3.
Information regarding interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis and/or certain third parties collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (“<strong>OBA</strong>”) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels.
OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis displays ads on both the Services and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, “<strong>Channels</strong>”).
We use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA.
For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article.
These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information.
These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel.
Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.</p>
<p>
<strong>The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change.</strong> For a list of some of the applicable providers, click here.
For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, click here.
For more details about OBA and opting out, click here.</p>
<p>Online Data is aggregated with the other information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived from your IP address or mobile device, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services.
We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.
We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</p>
<p>We engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
We do not authorize such third party providers to collect Personal Information from our Services for their own purposes.
Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained by Ziff Davis for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire.
However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a Channel.</p>
<p>We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them.
We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier.
Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system.
(ii) combine User Information about you received from Ziff Davis with information about you from other sites or services.
and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
<p>Our ad network partners may use cookies, web beacons and advertising IDs to collect information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.
If you wish to not have this information used by Ziff Davis or vendors collecting OBA data on the Services for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising.
If you opt out of interest-based ads, you will continue to receive ads, but these ads may not be as relevant to your interests.
If you change your computer, change your browser, reset your advertising ID, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out settings.</p>
<p>4.
What information we give to third parties.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis provides User Information to third party companies and contractors who work on our behalf to provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, email address validation, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing.
These companies work on our behalf, are authorized by Ziff Davis to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service, and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the sale of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services.
These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
<p>At times, we conduct contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or produce and host sponsored white papers, webcasts or other downloads for a variety of companies (“Sponsors”).
Information collected during the registration for such events is used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the Sponsor and others.
The information collected would be subject to our Privacy Policy and, in the event that it is shared with a Sponsor or other third party, would also be subject to the Sponsor’s or such other third party’s privacy policy, and it may be used by us, the Sponsor, and/or such other third parties for follow up purposes.
We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events.
For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information.</p>
<p>For some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer’s name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g.
sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with webcasts, white papers or other sponsored downloads.
While many customers appreciate the communications they receive from the third party providers of goods and services to whom we provide lists of our customers, if you no longer wish to receive messages from individual providers, follow the unsubscribe link and instructions at the bottom of the provider’s message or contact the third party provider directly to be removed from their list.</p>
<p>When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ziff Davis), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner.
This may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.
Use of your information by such partners may be subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
<p>In order to help us sell advertising on the Services and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and its brands, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience.
Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the Services and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.</p>
<p>We may also disclose User Information that we receive from you and from third party and public sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers) that want to market products or services to you.
In addition, we provide information to third parties for OBA as discussed above.</p>
<p>Ziff Davis and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements and perform related services when you visit the Services.
Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services.
We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>

<p>Offers.com</p>
<p>Offers.com is a Ziff Davis website and application.
When you install the Offers.com extension on your web browser, you may be offered coupons which are relevant to your online shopping experience.
Offers.com has relationships with various third party merchants (<strong>“Merchants”</strong>), and coupons may be offered to you when you either search for a particular Merchant on your web browser or when you visit a particular Merchant’s website.
The Offers.com extension may also use cookies to track your browsing history (if available) and the amount of money you spend on a particular Merchant’s website.
All data collected about your browsing and spending history collected is collected anonymously and is then used by Offers.com for internal purposes only.</p>
<p>When using the Offers.com service, we may collect information that is about you but does not identify you, such as your merchant, brand and coupon preferences, and your interactions with Offers.com and its merchants.
This and certain other information about you as described above (including Personal Information) may be collected when you: (1) search for merchants, brands or coupons, (2) view, display, click, print or download a coupon.
(3) submit or redeem a coupon to a merchant.
or (4) interact with advertisements appearing on the Offers.com website.</p>

<p>Ookla</p>
<p>Ookla is a Ziff Davis company and operator of Speedtest.net, Speedtest Custom and Pingtest.net, as well as the Speedtest applications.
Speedtest by Ookla is also offered on multiple devices, products and platforms, such as an extension on your web browser or as an application in certain products such as routers.</p>
<p>When conducting a test through Speedtest on any device or platform, we collect the test results, approximate location of the server and user machine (using publicly available information and if made available by your mobile device) and other information including the IP address, the ISP, college or organization that operates the network you test, and network, hardware and device identifiers such as your SSID or IMEI (if the test is conducted on a smartphone).
If you install the Speedtest extension on your web browser, in addition to allowing you to run a test of your internet speed, the extension uses our Web Speed feature, which measures the load time for a particular website and allows you to measure how long it takes for a particular website to load.
Through the Web Speed feature, we collect page load metrics for the websites you visit, including page URLs, load times, and the approximate location of your device (using publicly available information), but Web Speed does not collect IP addresses.
We also combine this information with recent Speedtest information from the same device.
You can opt out of the Web Speed feature at any time by adjusting the settings on your web browser.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described herein, the information we gather from all tests run through Ookla’s brands is collected anonymously and then aggregated to provide performance data to users on the Ookla websites and/or to third parties to whom we license the information.
We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for users around the world.
The only Speedtest results we do not license to third parties are those from instances of Speedtest Custom which have a paid subscription.
in such instances, the Speedtest results are owned by the subscriber and would be subject to that subscriber’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>Information collected from tests run through Speedtest may not be anonymous as follows: Ookla may use publicly-available data collected through the Web Speed feature of the Speedtest extension on your web browser to ascertain your approximate location (if your browser settings allow it).
In most cases, the IP addresses collected when you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest applications, or through the Speedtest feature of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information.
For some ISPs and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware or device identifiers, for such ISP or mobile carrier’s customers upon request.
Ookla may also provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware and device identifiers, to equipment manufacturers and core network, or wholesale, providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes.
In the cases in which we provide the full IP address, and network, hardware and device identifiers, it is because the company, typically an ISP or mobile carrier, owns those IP addresses, and/or network, hardware or device identifiers and provides them to their customers when their customers enter into a service contract.
Ookla may also collection geolocation information during a test, but it does not link such information to any Personal Information.</p>
<p>For more information concerning your use of Ookla’s websites and services (including Speedtest, Speedtest Custom and Pingtest), please visit the Ookla Terms of Use page.
