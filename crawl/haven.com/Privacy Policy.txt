We’ll also collect technical information, which helps us make sure our website is working at its best, so you can have a smooth experience when browsing.
We will occasionally share information with third parties (such as business partners and service providers) so we can give you the best possible service. </p>
<p>If you’re going on a break with us, we’ll ask you to tell us a little more about yourself, including any health conditions.
We only do this so we can plan your break around any special requirements you might have. </p>
<p>We keep your personal information safe and secure, and only hold onto it for a limited time.
If you’d like to stop receiving our email marketing and offers, you can click ‘unsubscribe’ at any time. </p>
