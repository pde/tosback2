You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers.
In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services.</p>

In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period.
Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or</p>
<p>de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.
We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.</p>
