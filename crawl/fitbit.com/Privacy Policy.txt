You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.</p> Additional Information <p>To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking.

<p>If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.</p> Information from Third-Party Services <p>If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service.
For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list.

<p>You may also authorize us to share your information with others, for example, with a third-party application when you give it access to your account, or with your employer when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program.
Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings.</p> For External Processing <p>We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys.</p> For Legal Reasons or To Prevent Harm <p>We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.

In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period.
Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.</p>
<p>We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.
We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.</p> Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data <p>We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live.
If you live in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (the “Designated Countries”), you have a number of legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Accessing and Exporting Data.</strong> By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics.
Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep.</p>
<p>
<strong>Editing and Deleting Data.</strong> Your account settings let you change and delete your personal information.
For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish.</p>
<p>If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems.
This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data.
We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section.</p>
<p>
<strong>Objecting to Data Use.</strong> We give you account settings and tools to control our data use.
For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services.
using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us.
and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account.
You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time.</p>

You have a general right to object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes.
Please see your notification settings to control our marketing communications to you about Fitbit products.

In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature.
For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends.
We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services.
We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections.</p> Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others <p>We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services.
This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving ads on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those ads.
These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications.
To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement.</p> Our Policies for Children <p>We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.</p>
<p>Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”).
Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information.
Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.</p>
<p>Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law.
If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at privacy@fitbit.com.</p> Information Security <p>We work hard to keep your data safe.
We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data.
This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services.
No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however.
If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support.</p> Our International Operations and Data Transfers <p>We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world.
These include your consent, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.
You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.
