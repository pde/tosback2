In the event of any conflict between these General Terms below and the Service-specific Terms of Service, the Service-specific Terms of Service shall control.
For purposes of these Terms of Service, all references to "Spectrum" mean Charter Communications Operating, LLC and any of its affiliates or subsidiaries providing Subscriber the Services (including third parties Spectrum may retain to provide the Services).
If Spectrum provides Spectrum Voice™ service in Subscriber's area, it will be provided through the Spectrum phone service affiliate servicing Subscriber's area.
Subscriber's signature on the work order presented upon installation of Services, the Subscriber Group's use of Services, and/or any other form of signature or action indicating intention to use (e.g., online acceptance, e-signature or breaking the seal on the box of a self-installation kit, activation of service) are evidence of Subscriber Group's agreement to these General Terms which incorporate the Terms of Service.
Spectrum may change its prices, fees, the Services, and/or the Terms of Service.
The Subscriber Group's continued use of the Services after notice of the change shall be considered Subscriber's acknowledgement and acceptance of the changes, and the most-recent version of these Terms of Service controls Subscriber's relationship with Spectrum and Spectrum's provision of Services to Subscriber.
The current version of the Terms of Service may be found at www.spectrum.com under "Terms of Service/Policies." Subscriber may not modify these General Terms, the Service-specific Terms of Service, or the Spectrum Subscriber Privacy Notice by making any typed, handwritten, or any other changes to it for any purpose.

Subscriber will be billed monthly in arrears for all Services used including without limitation, Pay Per View, On Demand, per unit or minute usage charges, roaming, or other Services ordered where charges are based on actual usage or on orders placed during the previous month.

If the Subscriber has more than one account (business and/or residential) served by Spectrum, all Spectrum-provided Services at all locations may be subject to suspension or discontinuance of Service in the event any one account remains unpaid, and Spectrum may apply any funds received from Subscriber first to such delinquent account(s).
Should Subscriber wish to resume Service after any suspension, Subscriber may be subject to reconnection fees.
Should Subscriber wish to resume Service after termination of Service, Spectrum may charge fees for installation, service calls and/or activation and reserves the right to charge rates different from those in place at the time of disconnect.
These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees.
In the event collection activities are required, additional collection charges may be imposed.

If Subscriber believes Subscriber's password or other means to access the Spectrum account has been lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, Subscriber must notify Spectrum immediately at 855-707-7328.
i.
Without limitation, Spectrum shall have no liability or responsibility for its inability to process or receive payments Subscriber makes or attempts to make using the One Time Pay or Auto Pay services or otherwise to perform its responsibilities under these Electronic Terms in the event circumstances beyond Spectrum's control prevent Spectrum from doing so or otherwise affect Spectrum's ability to do so.

Subscriber agrees to pay such charge whether the Equipment is lost (through theft or otherwise), damaged or destroyed.
9.
Disruption of Service: All Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

Spectrum shall have the right to presume misuse or other improper operations or handling by Subscriber in the event Subscriber requests repair or replacement more than twice in any twelve (12) month period, or more than three times in any twenty-four (24) month period, and shall have no obligation to fulfill any such repair or replacement.

The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, Subscriber or Spectrum may commence an arbitration proceeding, in which all issues are for the arbitrator to decide (including the scope of the arbitration clause), but the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of these General Terms.
The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these General Terms, and the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.

The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.
The three-arbitrator panel must issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which may exist under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The parties may agree that arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.

Subscriber's decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on Subscriber's relationship with Spectrum or the delivery of Services to Subscriber by Spectrum.
Severability.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT SOME OR ALL OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.

Please be aware that, by law in some cases, Subscriber may be billed for taxes and fees that relate to time periods before Subscriber began receiving Services.
However, by law, Spectrum will not bill Subscriber for these fees more than 4 years after the year they were incurred by Spectrum.
Franchise fees resulting from an audit by the applicable franchising authority are incurred at the time those fees are assessed.

Any alteration, tampering, removal, or the use of Equipment or Wiring which permits the receipt of Services without authorization or the receipt of Services to an unauthorized number of outlets, or to unauthorized locations, constitutes theft of Service and is prohibited.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon receipt of a request by Subscriber, Spectrum shall relocate the Equipment for Subscriber within Subscriber's home at a time mutually agreed to by Spectrum and Subscriber.
Subscriber may incur a charge for such relocation and should consult a current Spectrum schedule of rates and charges prior to requesting such relocation.
If the Subscriber moves residences outside of Spectrum's service area, Subscriber shall notify Spectrum that these General Terms shall be terminated and the provisions of Section 17 shall apply to such termination.

If the installation and maintenance of Service are requested at premises that, in Spectrum's sole discretion, are or may become hazardous or dangerous to our employees, the public or property, Spectrum may refuse to install and maintain such Service.

The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.

If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT SOME OR ALL OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.

Transmission or distribution of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited.
This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, illegal, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.

Security/Abuse of Resources.
User is solely responsible for the security of any device connected to the Service, including any data stored on that device.

In the instance when the Subscriber is using a wireless router, Spectrum requires that any wireless network be secure and encrypted.
Open, unencrypted wireless networks are strictly prohibited.

Failure to address an issue after notification will be considered a violation of this AUP.
5.
Network Management.
Spectrum uses a variety of reasonable network management tools and practices consistent with industry standards.
In the event the periods of congestion necessitate such management, Spectrum has available the following tools and practices (without limitation and as may be adjusted over time): (i) Subscriber Traffic Management (STM) technology to temporarily lower the priority of traffic with the greatest impact on peak congestion.
(ii) spam filtering and detection techniques.
and (iii) measures to protect the security and integrity of its network, resources and subscribers (e.g., IP reputation services from multiple sources to deny mail relay to suspect IPs off Charter IP space, real-time IP block lists to determine whether to accept a connection to inbound mail servers, port security techniques such as encryption and authentication, and email server-to-server traffic monitoring).
In limited instances if employed, these techniques may affect the throughput rate at which subscribers may send and receive data, the ability of users to establish session connections within the network, or result in the delay of certain traffic during times of peak congestion.
For more information about Spectrum's network management practices and policies, please see the Spectrum Network Management Practices Statement.
6.
Viruses.
Users must take appropriate action to prevent their systems from becoming infected with and/or distributing computer viruses such as but not limited to worms, "Trojan horses", denial of service attacks, and bots.

7.
Enforcement.
Spectrum reserves the right to investigate violations of this AUP, including the gathering of information from the Subscriber or other Users involved and the complaining party, if any, and the examination of material on Spectrum's servers and network.
Spectrum prefers to advise Users of AUP violations and any necessary corrective action but, if Spectrum, in its sole discretion, determines that a User has violated the AUP, Spectrum will take any responsive action that is deemed appropriate without prior notification.
Such action includes but is not limited to: temporary suspension of service, reduction of service resources, and termination of service.
Spectrum is not liable for any such responsive action and these actions are not exclusive.
Spectrum may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.

IMPORTANT: The emergency service provider handling the E-911 call, and the address the emergency service provider will see, are linked to the service address Spectrum has on file when Subscriber originally signed up for service.
If Subscriber does not correctly identify where Subscriber's voice modem is actually located, or if the voice modem is moved away from the original service address, Subscriber's E-911 calls may be misdirected to the wrong location(s) or to the wrong emergency service provider(s).
Therefore, in order to have E-911 calls routed correctly, Subscriber agrees not to move the voice modem from the service address at which it was installed by Spectrum and acknowledges responsibility to promptly notify Spectrum of any change in service address prior to moving the voice modem.

IMPORTANT: Keeping Your Phone Number: Please be aware that during the first 72 hours of arriving at Subscriber's new service address, if Subscriber dials 911 from their Spectrum Voice Service, Subscriber must relay to the emergency service operator the new (current) service address.
This is necessary to ensure emergency services are dispatched to Subscriber's new service address and not the old service address in the event the emergency services operator may not have the new location in their records.
- iii.
Spectrum Voice Service does not have its own power supply.
If there is a power outage, or if there is a disruption to the cable network or facilities, the Voice Service will not work.
Subscriber expressly acknowledges that in such cases it will not be possible to place or receive calls including calls to access emergency 911 services.
- iv.
If Subscriber chooses, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with the voice modem by calling Spectrum at 1-888-438-2427.
Each battery backup is designed to provide power for up to 8 hours (or 5 hours of "talk" time) for a power outage at Subscriber's residence that is not also a network-related outage.
- v.
In some locations, E-911 service may not yet be available.
Such services are dependent on the equipment and facilities of the local governments in which Spectrum provides Voice Service.
In such cases, regular 911 service will be available and Subscriber will need to convey the location information to the emergency operator.

International Calling: Spectrum Voice Service offers a per minute calling plan for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses to use this service Subscriber will be charged for direct-dial international calls in addition to the flat monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Spectrum Voice Service.
Spectrum Voice Service also offers optional flat rate international calling plans for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses an international plan, Subscriber will be charged a flat monthly fee for direct-dial international calls in addition to the monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Voice Service.
After Subscriber's monthly international calling plan minutes are used, unless Subscriber's plan includes unlimited international calling, each additional minute will be charged at a per-minute rate.
For both per-minute international calling and international calling plans, calls are measured in increments of one minute.
All calls which are a fraction of a minute are rounded up to the next whole minute.
Timing on completed calls begins when the call is answered by the called party.
Answering is determined when call signaling provided by the terminating local carrier, and/or any intermediate carrier(s), so indicate.
Timing terminates on all calls when the calling party hangs up or when Spectrum's network receives a termination signal from the terminating local carrier and/or any intermediate carrier(s).
Unused minutes per month do not roll over to the next month.
You may access international rates and information about international calling plans online at www.spectrum.net/rates.

Voice Service Limitations: a.
Service Outages: The Spectrum Voice Service modem is electrically powered and will not work in a power outage or if the broadband connection is disrupted or not operating.
In the event of power outages, the modem, including all phones and Voice Services connected to or powered by it, will not work.
Power outages will disrupt E-911 service and the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between a home security system and central monitoring services.
To reduce this risk, Subscriber may choose to purchase a battery backup for use in the event of a non-network related outage.
b.
Home Security Systems: Although Spectrum Voice Service will supply a connection that will allow the operation of Subscriber's existing home security system, Spectrum does not guarantee that any such system will be in complete operational order following the installation of the Voice Service.
As such, it is Subscriber's obligation to contact their home security system provider to inform them of Spectrum Voice Service installation, and any change in phone number, and to request a complete operational test of their system immediately following installation of the Voice Service.
In addition, it is Subscriber's responsibility to test their system on a regular basis.
In the event of a power outage or network outage (whether unplanned or maintenance related), Subscriber's Voice Service, including any home security system which uses the Voice Service to connect to central station monitoring, will not function.
As set forth in Section 3(b)(iv) above, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with their voice modem in the instance of a non-network related outage.
Like any other communications service provider, we do not represent that our service is fail-safe.
In addition, Spectrum prohibits the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between medical alert systems and a central station monitoring service, and will neither connect to such services nor provide technical support for the connection.
c.
Additional Limitations: - i.
Currently, certain operator-assisted services such as busy line verification and busy line interruption, dial around services (10-10-XXX), pay services (900 and 976 services), and third-party billing are not offered with Voice Service.
- ii.
If Subscriber receives Voicemail, Subscriber may be eligible for voice-to-text or voice-to-email ("Readable Voicemail") as part of the Voicemail feature.
As a result of the voice-recognition software used by Spectrum, some processed messages may not be fully transcribed and will appear as incomplete messages.
In such cases, Subscriber may obtain the full message by listening to the Readable Voicemail message.
As a condition of using the voice-to-text or voice-to-email feature, Subscriber consents to allow Spectrum, or its service vendors, to process those voice files and to use voicemail messages, and other data associated with such messages, to enhance and/or improve the feature.
- iii.
Spectrum's obligation to furnish Voice Services is dependent upon its ability to secure and retain, without unreasonable expense, suitable facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance of the necessary facilities and equipment.
Spectrum may limit communications, refuse to provide Voice Services or discontinue Voice Services when necessary because of: (i) the lack of transmission medium, transmission capacity or any other facilities or equipment.
(ii) the lack of available services from, or interconnection with, the services or facilities of service providers.
or (iii) any cause beyond Spectrum's control.
- iv.
Spectrum shall use reasonable efforts to make Voice Services available by the estimated service date.
Spectrum shall not be liable for any damages resulting from delays in meeting the estimated service date due to delays resulting from normal installation procedures.
Such delays shall include, but not be limited to, delays in obtaining right-of-way approvals, delays in actual construction work being done by Spectrum, including its contractors or representatives, and any delays due to any other service provider where Spectrum is relying upon such provider to meet an estimated due date which is beyond Spectrum's control.
- v.
Spectrum offers the use of its facilities for communications between Subscriber and other parties.
Spectrum is not responsible, and shall have no liability, for any communications or miscommunications between Subscriber (including any users) and other parties (including operator-assisted, 911 and E-911 calls).
- vi.
At Spectrum's discretion, facilities of other service providers may be used in establishing connections to points not reached by Spectrum's facilities.
In establishing connections with other providers, Spectrum is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of other service providers.
- vii.
The Phone2Go mobile application is provided by Spectrum for use only by Spectrum residential Voice Service customers, and only in certain areas.
Certain features of Spectrum's Voice Service may not be available with the Phone2Go application, and certain features available within the Phone2Go application may be subject to additional terms and conditions as presented within the Phone2Go application.
d.
Equipment: Spectrum Voice Service requires a voice modem.
Spectrum will supply a voice modem for so long as Subscriber remains a Voice Service Subscriber or until Spectrum changes its Voice Service offering.
Depending on the Spectrum Voice Service plan, there may be a monthly charge for the voice modem.
Upon termination of Spectrum Voice Service for any reason, Subscriber may be asked to return the Spectrum-supplied voice modem within thirty (30) days or Subscriber will be charged an equipment fee equal to the fee charged by Spectrum at the time the voice modem was supplied by Spectrum.
An exception to this return policy is when the modem is also supporting Internet service, in which case Subscriber may continue to use the modem until such time as Internet is no longer provided or Spectrum requests a substitution of the modem.
Equipment and facilities furnished by Spectrum to provide Voice Service (except for inside wiring and inside jacks) are the property of Spectrum.
Telephone numbers assigned to Subscriber by Spectrum are portable and transferable with Subscriber at the same location.

Depending on the location and Subscriber's preference, Spectrum Voice Service may include one (1) basic directory listing in an alphabetical white pages directory, or other comparable online directory, containing an alphabetical list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of all telephone customers in a particular geographic area set by the publisher.
The alphabetical list of customer names is for the purpose of informing interested parties of the telephone number and address of listed customers, and special position or arrangement of names may be provided for an additional charge.
Listings shall conform to the publisher's practices with respect to published directories.
Spectrum limits the length of any listing in the directory by the use of abbreviations when, in Spectrum's opinion, the clarity of the listing or the identification of the customer is not impaired by doing so.
The duration of directory listings, when the listings have been published, is the directory period.
The directory period is from the day on which the directory is first distributed to customers to the day the succeeding directory is first distributed to customers.
Spectrum's liability for directory listing errors or omissions is set out in Section 7, "Limitation of Liability." 7.

This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, illegal, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.
Spectrum may block calls or data transmissions that are made to, or received from, certain countries, cities or telephone exchanges, or that use certain authorization codes if, in its sole discretion, Spectrum deems it reasonably necessary to prevent non-standard, excessive, unlawful or fraudulent use of the Mobile Service.
Furthermore, use of the Mobile Service to impersonate a person or entity or to engage in fraudulent activities is not permitted.
SPECTRUM RESERVES THE RIGHT AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR RESTRICT USE OF MOBILE SERVICE WITHOUT NOTICE IF SUCH USE VIOLATES THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.
9.
Roaming Charges: Roaming means coverage on another mobile network operator's network ("Roaming").
Subscriber's Mobile Service may be used for international calling and Roaming.
Mobile Service originated or received while outside a Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area is subject to Roaming charges.
Whether a Device can roam depends on Subscriber's Device, the Mobile Service plan, and the availability of Roaming coverage.
Certain Mobile Service may not be available or work the same when Roaming (for example, data services, voicemail, or call waiting).
Use of the Mobile Service while Roaming is also dependent on the Roaming provider's support of applicable network technology and functionality.
There may be higher rates and extra charges (including charges for long distance, tolls, or calls that do not connect) for international calling or when Roaming.
Subscriber may or may not be informed that he or she is Roaming, or of the associated costs.
Roaming may be limited or not available if more than half of Subscriber's monthly Mobile Service usage during a consecutive sixty (60) day period is outside the Subscriber's Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area (as described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Additionally, Spectrum may block the use of voice, text, and/or data service while Roaming within certain countries as Spectrum deems reasonably necessary to prevent non-standard, excessive, unlawful or fraudulent use of Mobile Service.
10.
Lost or Stolen Device: Subscriber agrees to call Spectrum immediately if his or her Device is lost or stolen so that the Mobile Service can be suspended to keep someone else from using it.
If Subscriber's Device is used after the loss or theft but before Subscriber reports it, and Subscriber wants a credit for any charges for that usage, Spectrum will review the account activity and any other information that Subscriber would like Spectrum to consider to show that the charges were not authorized.
Subscriber may be asked to provide or submit information to support the claim.
Spectrum may add the Device to the national "lost and stolen list," to prevent the Device from being used on any mobile network operator's network.
Subscriber may be held responsible for the charges if he or she delays reporting the loss or theft without good reason, but Subscriber does not have to pay any Mobile Service charges Subscriber disputes while they are being investigated.
A lost or stolen Device does not release Subscriber from their payment obligation under any Device Payment Plan or Lease Plan.
California Subscribers Only: Although Subscriber is not liable for charges Subscriber did not authorize, Spectrum considers the fact that a call was placed from Subscriber's Device as evidence that the call was authorized.
Unauthorized charges may include calls made to or from Subscriber's Device after it was lost or stolen.
If Subscriber does not report the loss or theft promptly, Subscriber may be responsible for the Mobile Service used until the incident is reported.
Once reported to Spectrum that the Device is lost or stolen and the Device is suspended, Subscriber will not be responsible for subsequent charges incurred by that Device.
If Spectrum has not given Subscriber a courtesy suspension of any recurring monthly charges during the past year, Spectrum will give Subscriber one (1) such suspension for thirty (30) days or until Subscriber replaces or recovers the Device, whichever comes first.
11.
Privacy &amp.
Information on a Device: As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may collect technical and service information from all Spectrum Mobile Service users during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service or from Subscriber's Device.
Such information may include Mobile Service plan and feature information, application download and usage information, Device or equipment information, network traffic or performance information, Mobile Service usage information, diagnostic data (including Device performance, signal strength, dropped call, data failure or battery strength information), and Location Information (defined below).
Spectrum may use such technical and service information to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
A Device can contain sensitive, personal information.
Spectrum is not responsible for any information stored on a Device, including sensitive or personal information.
Spectrum recommends that Subscriber safeguard any sensitive or personal information when the Device is out of Subscriber's possession or control.
By submitting a Device to Spectrum, Subscriber agrees that Spectrum employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on a Device.
If Subscriber exchanges, returns, or recycles a Device through Spectrum, Subscriber must remove all data and information from the Device before Subscriber provides it to Spectrum.
12.
Monthly Service Fee: Subscriber agrees to pay the monthly service charge for Spectrum Mobile Service which is comprised of various fees, taxes, and governmental or regulatory surcharges, such as federal or state universal service fund surcharges.
Spectrum reserves the right to increase or decrease any fee for Mobile Service offered.
Spectrum Mobile Service shall be terminated in the event Subscriber does not pay.
Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in Subscriber's Mobile Service plan (described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and Internet access.
Spectrum may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, Device, Lease Plan, installment plan charges, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Subscriber's Mobile Service.
Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, or handset upgrades).
Spectrum will notify Subscriber if any of these fees apply to the requested transaction.
To determine Subscriber's primary place of use ("PPU"), and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, Subscriber is required to provide Spectrum with Subscriber's residential street address.
If Subscriber does not provide Spectrum with such address, or if it falls outside of Spectrum's Coverage Area, Spectrum may reasonably designate a PPU within the Coverage Area for Subscriber.
Subscriber must live and have a mailing address within Spectrum's Coverage Area.
If Subscriber intends to use a Device at an alternate address, Subscriber must update the PPU for Subscriber's account by contacting Spectrum at (833) 224-6603.
13.
Billing: Subscriber will be billed on a monthly basis, in advance, for recurring Mobile Service and Device charges (e.g., line of service fees and/or associated taxes, service plan fees, features, prepaid usage, Spectrum Mobile Device Payment Plan, Lease Plan and any Device Protection Plan purchased), and in arrears for usage charges (e.g., data, international calling, and Roaming).
Charges for Roaming and international data may not appear on a billing statement during the bill cycle when the calls and/or data usage were incurred due to delays in receiving and reviewing such records.
If Subscriber receives Mobile Service or a Device under a promotion, after the promotional period ends the then-current market prices for Subscriber's Mobile Service or Device will apply.
For charges based on the amount of time used or for data sent or received, Spectrum will round up any fraction to the next full minute or, depending on how Subscriber is billed for data usage, the next full megabyte ("MB") or gigabyte ("GB").
For outgoing calls, usage time starts when Subscriber first presses 'SEND' (or similar key) or the call connects to a network.
and for incoming calls, it starts when the call connects to a network (which may be before it rings).
Usage time may end several seconds after Subscriber presses 'END' (or similar key) or after the call disconnects.
For calls made on the network, Spectrum will charge only for calls that are answered, including by machines.
Usage cannot always be processed right away and may be included in a later bill.
Subscribers with an unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service plan will pay a monthly charge for the Service in accordance with the terms of such plan.
For Subscribers with a Spectrum Mobile Service plan based on the amount of time used and/or data sent or received, Subscriber will be charged for all data sent, received, consumed by and/or used on Subscriber's account, including, without limitation, data consumed by applications (including any Spectrum Mobile Service and/or other Spectrum applications), widgets, multi-media messaging, tethering, uploading, downloading, streaming Content, Internet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications), GPS and location services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with Content sent or received).
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with a single line receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis will be rounded up to the next MB or GB, depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service plan.
For example, if Subscriber uses 1.2 GBs of data during a bill cycle, Subscriber will be billed for 2 GBs of usage.
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with multiple lines receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis may be aggregated and then rounded up to the next GB, depending on the terms of your Mobile Service plan.
If Subscriber selects a Mobile Service plan under a promotion that includes a predetermined allotment of Mobile Service (for example, a predetermined about of gigabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as part of such Mobile Service plan, any unused allotment of Mobile Service from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle.
Subscriber's first billing cycle will begin upon the earlier of Device activation or seven (7) days after the Device's shipment date, and Subscriber's first invoice may include partial-month charges for Service in addition to the charges above.
All Spectrum Mobile Service bills will be available via the MyAccount web portal and application.
Subscriber will be billed separately for Spectrum Mobile Service from any other Spectrum services, including Spectrum Internet or Spectrum TV.
14.
Unauthorized Charges: SUBSCRIBER SHOULD USE CARE WHEN ALLOWING ANOTHER PERSON, INCLUDING A CHILD OR OTHER MINOR, TO USE A DEVICE ON SUBSCRIBER'S ACCOUNT.
Subscriber is obligated to pay all charges incurred, including charges from any other user of a Device associated with Subscriber's account.
Many services and applications are accessible on or through a Device, including purchases of games, movies, music, and other Content.
Some of these services are provided by Spectrum.
Others are provided by third parties that may offer the option to bill charges to Subscriber's Spectrum bill or other methods of payment.
Charges may be one-time or recurring.
If the purchaser is permitted to have charges billed to Subscriber's account and so chooses, such charges will become part of the amount due for that billing cycle.
Subscriber is solely responsible for all charges to such third parties, including all applicable taxes.
In addition, Subscriber is solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.
Spectrum may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party.
Spectrum will not be responsible for any dispute regarding charges between Subscriber and any third party.
Subscriber must address all such disputes directly with the third party.
15.
Spectrum's Right to Limit or End Mobile Service or this Agreement: Spectrum can, without notice, limit, suspend or end Subscriber's Mobile Service or any agreement with Subscriber for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if Subscriber: (a) breaches this Agreement.
(b) resells his or her Mobile Service.
(c) uses the Mobile Service for any illegal or fraudulent purpose.
(d) installs, deploys, or uses any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate a radio frequency signal without Spectrum's permission.
(e) steals from or lies to Spectrum.
(f) fails to pay his or her bill on time for any Spectrum service.
(g) incurs charges larger than a required Deposit or billing limit, or materially in excess of his or her monthly access charges (even if Spectrum hasn't yet billed the charges).
or (h) is unable to pay Spectrum or goes bankrupt.
or (2) if Subscriber or any user of Subscriber's Device, or any line of Mobile Service on Subscriber's account: (a) threatens, harasses, or uses vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward Spectrum's representatives.
(b) interferes with Spectrum's operations.
(c) "spams" or engages in other abusive messaging or calling.
(d) modifies his or her Device from its manufacturer's specifications.
or (e) uses Subscriber's Mobile Service in a way that negatively affects the network or other customers or that violates the restrictions in Section 8, above.
Spectrum can also temporarily limit Subscriber's Mobile Service for any operational or governmental reason.
Spectrum's rights under this section are in addition to any specific rights that Spectrum reserves in other provisions of this Agreement or in other Terms of Service to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service and to terminate Subscriber's Agreement.
16.
Porting: Subscriber may be able to transfer, or "port," his or her mobile phone number to another mobile network operator.
If Subscriber ports a number from Spectrum, Spectrum will treat it as though Subscriber requested Spectrum to cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service for that number.
After the porting is completed, Subscriber will not be able to use Spectrum's Mobile Service for that number, but Subscriber will remain responsible for all Mobile Service fees and charges incurred through the end of that billing cycle, and any Device charges, just like any other cancellation.
If Subscriber ports a number to Spectrum, Spectrum may not be able to provide some services right away, such as E-911 services.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that except as required by applicable law, Subscriber does not have any proprietary rights to the mobile number assigned by Spectrum, except for any right Subscriber may have to port it.
17.
Location Information: Subscriber's Device or Spectrum's Mobile Service can determine the physical geographical location of the Device and Subscriber ("Location Information").
As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may automatically collect Location Information or other customer data during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service.
Together, Spectrum, its partners, and/or the network service provider may use Location Information, as well as customer data, usage and performance information obtained from the network or Subscriber's Device, to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
Location Information may also be used to create aggregate data from which Subscriber's personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured.
Such aggregate data may be used for a variety of purposes (e.g., scientific and marketing research, vehicle traffic volume and monitoring).
It is Subscriber's responsibility to notify users on Subscriber's account that such information may be collected by such users' use of the Mobile Service or from Devices linked to Subscriber's account.
Subscriber's Device is also capable of using optional Content at Subscriber's request or the request of a user on Subscriber's account, offered by Spectrum or third parties that make use of a Device's Location Information ("Location-Based Service").
Subscriber should review the terms and conditions and the associated privacy policy for each Location-Based Service to learn how the location information will be used and protected.
If Subscriber does not want the Location-Based Service to collect or use Location Information, Subscriber should disable location services on the Device using the Device settings.
18.
911 and Emergency Alerts: When making calls to a public-safety answering point ("PSAP") from a Device, such as dialing 911, Subscriber should always be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number.
Unlike calls from a traditional wireline phone, a PSAP may not know the emergency caller's location or phone number.
Although some local emergency authorities have enabled E-911 services that use GPS or other methods to determine callers' locations, E-911 does not always provide accurate location information.
If Subscriber's Device is indoors, cannot acquire a satellite signal, or otherwise cannot obtain the caller's location, the Location Information may not be automatically delivered to the PSAP.
Also the process of porting a phone number may limit the Mobile Service from being able to provide location services to the PSAP during that time.
If Subscriber makes a 911 call, the 911 operator may see a phone number that is different from Subscriber's personal phone number.
There may be instances when the PSAP might not be able to call Subscriber back.
Calls to 911 over WiFi or a data connection may operate differently than traditional wireline calls to 911.
Such calls may not connect to the PSAP, may be limited, or may be unavailable if Subscriber is experiencing a power outage, if there is a disruption in WiFi service or to the data connection, or if Subscriber is unable to access the Internet.
If Subscriber's call connects to a PSAP, his or her Location Information and phone number may not be transmitted.
Additionally, if Subscriber has not updated his or her emergency 911 address in the settings of their Device, their Device may provide a PSAP with Location Information that is different from Subscriber's calling location.
Subscriber should be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number to the PSAP.
If Subscriber is deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled and needs to reach emergency services, Subscriber should call 911 directly using TTY or a telecommunications relay service.
Spectrum may also provide wireless emergency alerts within portions of its Coverage Area on wireless emergency alert capable devices.
There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.
Wireless emergency alerts may not be available on all Devices or in the entire Coverage Area, or if Subscriber is outside of the Coverage Area.
In areas in which the emergency alerts are transmitted, such alerts may not be received by a Subscriber or user of Spectrum's Mobile Service even though the user has a Device capable of receiving them.

<p>Spectrum Residential Mobile Service Broadband Disclosures</p> Charter's Spectrum Residential Mobile broadband Internet access service ("Spectrum Mobile Service," "Service" or "Spectrum") utilizes our mobile network partner(s)' ("MNP") mobile broadband Internet access service network and is subject to its network management practices and controls.
The disclosures below reflect, where appropriate, those practices and controls.
These disclosures do not describe the practices, characteristics, or terms that apply when our customers are roaming on mobile networks other than those of our MNP.
In order to purchase Spectrum Mobile Service, Subscriber must be an existing customer of Spectrum Internet, or Subscriber must purchase Spectrum Internet at the time of purchase of Spectrum Mobile Service.
As long as Subscriber remains a customer of Spectrum Internet, Subscriber will have access to Spectrum's WiFi hotspots.
Network Practices The bullets below provide an overview of the network practices applicable to Spectrum Mobile Service.
• Blocking Spectrum Mobile Service does not block or otherwise prevent end user access to lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
Spectrum Mobile Service does engage in reasonable network management practices described below.
• Throttling Spectrum Mobile Service does not degrade or impair access to lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of a non-harmful device.
Spectrum Mobile Service does engage in reasonable network management practices described below, including limiting video streaming to DVD quality (typically 480p) for customers using our MNP's network.
• Affiliated Prioritization Spectrum Mobile Service does not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, to benefit an affiliate.
• Paid Prioritization Spectrum Mobile Service does not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, in exchange for consideration, monetary or otherwise.
• Congestion Management Over Mobile Network.
Spectrum Mobile Service strives to provide Spectrum Mobile Service customers the best experience when they are using our MNP's network.
However, an individual user's experience will vary depending upon many factors, including the MNP network (3G Ev-DO or 4G LTE) the customer is using and the mobile device ("device") in use.
Our MNP uses optimization and transcoding technologies on both the 3G Ev-DO and 4G LTE networks to transmit data files in a more efficient manner to allow available network capacity to benefit the greatest number of users.
These techniques include caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing video files more appropriately for mobile devices.
These techniques are agnostic as to the content itself and to the website that provides it.
While these techniques seek to avoid changing text, image, and video files, and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible by the customer, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on a customer's mobile device.
Over WiFi.
When Spectrum Mobile Service customers are connected using WiFi, congestion management practices applicable to that connection will vary by Internet Service Provider ("ISP").
On Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home, Spectrum uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards.
Additional information on Spectrum's congestion management practices is available here.
Spectrum is not responsible for the congestion management techniques used by other ISPs for their WiFi networks.
If your device connects to another ISP's WiFi network, you should consult that provider's terms of service and broadband disclosures for information about their practices.
The optimization and transcoding techniques described above under Over Mobile Network are not applied when a device is utilizing Spectrum WiFi (and may not be utilized by other WiFi service providers) to transmit data, and therefore text, image, and video files will be delivered over WiFi at the native resolution.
Roaming.
For those geographic areas that are not served by our MNP's owned and operated mobile networks, our MNPs enter into agreements with other mobile network providers.
The use of customers' devices to access data over another provider's networks - both domestic and international - is called "roaming" usage.
Our ability to make Services available to customers on these other mobile networks is based on a variety of dynamic factors, including business considerations, the terms of the agreements our MNPs have at any given time with other mobile network providers, and the network technology, frequency(ies) and functionality of those networks.
Use of Spectrum Mobile Services when roaming is dependent upon the roaming provider's support of applicable network technology and functionality.
Check with roaming network providers individually for support and coverage details.
Devices can transmit and receive data messages without user intervention and can generate unexpected charges when powered "on" outside the United States, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands.
Certain countries and/or carriers within a roaming zone may be unavailable while roaming.
We do not guarantee the availability, quality of coverage or speed for roaming Services that are accessed using other mobile network provider networks and we may reduce speeds to 2G speeds or suspend the roaming Service available on these networks at any time without notice.
• Application-Specific Behavior You may access any lawful application for use on the Spectrum Mobile Service, subject to our Residential General Terms and Conditions of Service, Network Management Practices, Spectrum Residential Mobile Services Agreement, and Privacy Policy discussed in these disclosures.
Spectrum reserves the right at all times to intervene to protect the integrity of its services, including its Spectrum Mobile Service, and network.
While Spectrum does not favor certain websites or Internet applications by blocking, throttling, or modifying particular protocols, protocol ports, or protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standards, we may prevent the use of certain ports on our Spectrum WiFi service that are commonly used to spread malware and engage in other malicious activity.
• Device Attachment Rules Information about obtaining a mobile device, including a list of approved mobile devices and their prices, is available here.
Depending on the capability of your mobile device, using your Spectrum Mobile Service to create a mobile hotspot to connect to other devices is permitted pursuant to the terms, conditions, and data pricing options of your Spectrum Mobile Service (see Commercial Terms, below) and subject to the network management practices and controls of our MNP.
• Security Spectrum recognizes that a reliable network must be, among other things, a secure network.
We, along with our MNP, work to protect the network against outside attacks, tampering, malicious activity, and network events that may in any way disrupt or degrade Spectrum Mobile Service customers' ability to use the network.
Our MNP blocks a limited number of Internet addresses that are disruptive or malicious and typically persistent, based on analysis and third-party intelligence.
Our MNP does not block sites based on content or subject, unless the Internet address hosts unlawful content.
Our MNP regularly reviews and modifies the list of blocked Internet addresses, taking any off the list that are no longer perceived as a threat.
Performance Characteristics • Service Description Over Mobile Network.
Spectrum Mobile Service offers mobile broadband Internet access services to its customers over 3G Ev-DO and 4G LTE mobile broadband networks.
Based on our MNP's internal testing and testing commissioned from third-party vendors, Spectrum expects customers will experience the following speeds on the Spectrum Mobile Service: • 4G LTE network: typical download speeds of 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload speeds of 2-5 Mbps.
• 3G Ev-DO network: typical download speeds of 600 kilobits per second (Kbps)-1.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 500-800 Kbps for Ev-DO Rev.
A devices (if you are using an Ev-DO Rev.
0 device, typical download speeds are 400-700 Kbps and upload speeds are 60-80 Kbps).
DVD-Quality Video streaming is supported at 4G speeds (video typically streams at 480p).
With respect to latency for use of real-time data applications, our MNP expects network-to-mobile device (round-trip) latency to be less than 100 milliseconds (ms) on our MNP's 4G network and less than 240ms on its 3G Ev-DO network.
Latency is the time delay in transmitting or receiving packets on a network.
Latency is primarily a function of the distance between two points in transmission, but also can be affected by the number and quality of connections to the network or networks used in transmission.
Our MNP currently does not report packet loss data, and so Spectrum Mobile Service is not technically able to measure packet loss on the network.
Packet loss is the percentage of packets that are sent by the source but not received by the destination.
This is sometimes due to congestion along the route but may also reflect an impairment in the network.
You must be using a 4G LTE mobile device and be within our MNP's 4G LTE coverage area to access its 4G LTE network.
You must be using a 3G Ev-DO-capable mobile device and be within our MNP's 3G Ev-DO coverage area to access its 3G Ev-DO network.
For 4G and 3G coverage information, click here.
Customers with 4G LTE devices will access the 3G Ev-DO network where it is available outside the 4G LTE coverage area.
The actual speeds you experience on our MNP's network will depend on many factors, including, among others, the type of mobile device, the programs running on the mobile device, your location, and how many other customers are attempting to use the same spectrum resources (including both mobile broadband Internet access and other non-broadband Internet access services that share the network).
Over Spectrum WiFi.
The results above do not reflect the Spectrum Mobile Service experienced by customers connected to Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home (or the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service).
Spectrum Mobile Service may automatically connect to Spectrum WiFi hotspots (or the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service) when available unless the customer changes mobile device settings to inhibit such functionality.
Performance over any WiFi network, including Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home, may vary based on any number of factors, such as, but not limited to, the number of other subscribers trying to use the same WiFi router at the same time, your mobile device, your WiFi receiving antenna, your distance to the WiFi router, attenuation from walls and foliage, and interference from other mobile devices using the same spectrum.
WiFi uses spectrum that the FCC has allocated for "unlicensed" use, which means that use of this spectrum is not protected from interference from other mobile devices using the same spectrum in the same geographic area.
Therefore, Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home, as well as any WiFi connections through your home Spectrum Internet service, is provided on a "best efforts" basis.
When not connected to Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home (or the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service), Spectrum Mobile Service will attempt to connect over our MNP's mobile broadband Internet access service network.
Additional information on Spectrum WiFi is available in our Network Management Practices as well as our Internet Authorized Usage Policy and Residential Internet Services Agreement - each of which are incorporated into our Residential General Terms and Conditions of Service.
• Other Services on the Network Spectrum Mobile Service uses our MNP's mobile broadband Internet access service network and shares that network with those services and other non-broadband Internet access services that our MNP offers.
When accessing Spectrum Mobile Service via a Spectrum WiFi access point, broadband Internet access service and Voice over WiFi service will be delivered via the access point.
When accessing Spectrum Mobile Service via another WiFi network, users may share those WiFi networks with other services that Spectrum does not know about or manage.
As such, Spectrum Mobile Service cannot predict other services that may share the WiFi network.
Commercial Terms • Pricing, Data Usage, and Other Fees Service is not available in all areas.
You must be a Spectrum Internet service customer to initially subscribe to Spectrum Mobile Service.
