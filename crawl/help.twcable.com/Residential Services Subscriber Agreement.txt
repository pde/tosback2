Spectrum may change its prices, fees, the Services, and/or the Terms of Service.
The Subscriber Group's continued use of the Services after notice of the change shall be considered Subscriber's acknowledgement and acceptance of the changes, and the most-recent version of these Terms of Service controls Subscriber's relationship with Spectrum and Spectrum's provision of Services to Subscriber.
The current version of the Terms of Service may be found at www.spectrum.com under "Terms of Service/Policies."

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of intent to arbitrate, entitled "Notice of Intent to Arbitrate" ("Notice").
The Notice to Spectrum should be addressed to: VP and Associate General Counsel, Litigation, Charter Communications, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St.
Louis, MO 63131 ("Arbitration Notice Address").
The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, Subscriber or Spectrum may commence an arbitration proceeding, in which all issues are for the arbitrator to decide (including the scope of the arbitration clause), but the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of these General Terms.
The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these General Terms, and the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "www.adr.org," by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address.

The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.
The three-arbitrator panel must issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which may exist under the Federal Arbitration Act.

The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking relief, only to the extent sought, and only to the extent necessary to provide the specific relief warranted by such individual's claim.
The parties agree that the arbitrator must give effect to the terms of these General Terms.

Severability.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT SOME OR ALL OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.

b.
E-911: Enhanced 911 ("E-911") is a feature of Spectrum Voice Service that allows emergency operators to automatically receive the telephone number and address of the dialing party.
This E-911 feature has certain requirements in order to operate, as well as certain limitations: - i.
IMPORTANT: The emergency service provider handling the E-911 call, and the address the emergency service provider will see, are linked to the service address Spectrum has on file when Subscriber originally signed up for service.
If Subscriber does not correctly identify where Subscriber's voice modem is actually located, or if the voice modem is moved away from the original service address, Subscriber's E-911 calls may be misdirected to the wrong location(s) or to the wrong emergency service provider(s).
Therefore, in order to have E-911 calls routed correctly, Subscriber agrees not to move the voice modem from the service address at which it was installed by Spectrum and acknowledges responsibility to promptly notify Spectrum of any change in service address prior to moving the voice modem.
- ii.
IMPORTANT: Keeping Your Phone Number: Please be aware that during the first 72 hours of arriving at Subscriber's new service address, if Subscriber dials 911 from their Spectrum Voice Service, Subscriber must relay to the emergency service operator the new (current) service address.
This is necessary to ensure emergency services are dispatched to Subscriber's new service address and not the old service address in the event the emergency services operator may not have the new location in their records.
- iii.
Spectrum Voice Service does not have its own power supply.
If there is a power outage, or if there is a disruption to the cable network or facilities, the Voice Service will not work.
Subscriber expressly acknowledges that in such cases it will not be possible to place or receive calls including calls to access emergency 911 services.
- iv.
If Subscriber chooses, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with the voice modem by calling Spectrum at 1-888-438-2427.
Each battery backup is designed to provide standby power for the battery life chosen by the Subscriber, and at least 5 hours of "talk" time, during a power outage at Subscriber's residence that is not also a network-related outage.
- v.
In some locations, E-911 service may not yet be available.
Such services are dependent on the equipment and facilities of the local governments in which Spectrum provides Voice Service.
In such cases, regular 911 service will be available and Subscriber will need to convey the location information to the emergency operator.

Number of Lines: Subscribers to Spectrum Voice Service can purchase up to two (2) lines at their service address.
d.
Installation: Spectrum Voice Service offers professional installation and self-installation (not available in all areas).

Spectrum does not provide a handset.
Subscriber is responsible for maintaining all inside wire and phones within the home.
Subscriber has the option of Spectrum's Wire Maintenance Insurance that may help avoid costly repair charges.
For a low monthly fee, we can provide repair service for Subscriber's jacks and inside wiring.
(The wiring must meet certified technical standards.) Wire maintenance is included in some bundles.
For more information about Wire Maintenance Insurance, go online to Spectrum's Wire Maintenance plan information at www.spectrum.net/wiremaintenance.
In certain buildings such as multiple dwelling units, Spectrum's technicians may not have access to Subscriber's inside wiring located within the multiple dwelling unit.

e.
International Calling: Spectrum Voice Service offers a per minute calling plan for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses to use this service Subscriber will be charged for direct-dial international calls in addition to the flat monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Spectrum Voice Service.
Spectrum Voice Service also offers optional flat rate international calling plans for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses an international plan, Subscriber will be charged a flat monthly fee for direct-dial international calls in addition to the monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Voice Service.
After Subscriber's monthly international calling plan minutes are used, unless Subscriber's plan includes unlimited international calling, each additional minute will be charged at a per-minute rate.
For both per-minute international calling and international calling plans, calls are measured in increments of one minute.
All calls which are a fraction of a minute are rounded up to the next whole minute.
Timing on completed calls begins when the call is answered by the called party.
Answering is determined when call signaling provided by the terminating local carrier, and/or any intermediate carrier(s), so indicate.
Timing terminates on all calls when the calling party hangs up or when Spectrum's network receives a termination signal from the terminating local carrier and/or any intermediate carrier(s).
Unused minutes per month do not roll over to the next month.
You may access international rates and information about international calling plans online at www.spectrum.net/rates.
f.
Voice Service Modifications: Spectrum may, from time to time, offer additional Voice Service features or functionality, or discontinue certain Voice Service features or functionality.

Voice Service Limitations: a.
Service Outages: The Spectrum Voice Service modem is electrically powered and will not work in a power outage or if the broadband connection is disrupted or not operating.
In the event of power outages, the modem, including all phones and Voice Services connected to or powered by it, will not work.
Power outages will disrupt E-911 service and the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between a home security system and central monitoring services.
To reduce this risk, Subscriber may choose to purchase a battery backup for use in the event of a non-network related outage.
b.
Home Security Systems: Although Spectrum Voice Service will supply a connection that will allow the operation of Subscriber's existing home security system, Spectrum does not guarantee that any such system will be in complete operational order following the installation of the Voice Service.
As such, it is Subscriber's obligation to contact their home security system provider to inform them of Spectrum Voice Service installation, and any change in phone number, and to request a complete operational test of their system immediately following installation of the Voice Service.
In addition, it is Subscriber's responsibility to test their system on a regular basis.
In the event of a power outage or network outage (whether unplanned or maintenance related), Subscriber's Voice Service, including any home security system which uses the Voice Service to connect to central station monitoring, will not function.
As set forth in Section 3(b)(iv) above, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with their voice modem in the instance of a non-network related outage.
Like any other communications service provider, we do not represent that our service is fail-safe.
In addition, Spectrum prohibits the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between medical alert systems and a central station monitoring service, and will neither connect to such services nor provide technical support for the connection.
c.
Additional Limitations: - i.
Currently, certain operator-assisted services such as busy line verification and busy line interruption, dial around services (10-10-XXX), pay services (900 and 976 services), and third party billing are not offered with Voice Service.
- ii.
If Subscriber receives Voicemail, Subscriber may be eligible for voice-to-text or voice-to-email ("Readable Voicemail") as part of the Voicemail feature.
As a result of the voice-recognition software used by Spectrum, some processed messages may not be fully transcribed and will appear as incomplete messages.
In such cases, Subscriber may obtain the full message by listening to the Readable Voicemail message.
As a condition of using the voice-to-text or voice-to-email feature, Subscriber consents to allow Spectrum, or its service vendors, to process those voice files and to use voicemail messages, and other data associated with such messages, to enhance and/or improve the feature.
- iii.
Spectrum's obligation to furnish Voice Services is dependent upon its ability to secure and retain, without unreasonable expense, suitable facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance of the necessary facilities and equipment.
Spectrum may limit communications, refuse to provide Voice Services or discontinue Voice Services when necessary because of: (i) the lack of transmission medium, transmission capacity or any other facilities or equipment.
(ii) the lack of available services from, or interconnection with, the services or facilities of service providers.
or (iii) any cause beyond Spectrum's control.
- iv.
Spectrum shall use reasonable efforts to make Voice Services available by the estimated service date.
Spectrum shall not be liable for any damages resulting from delays in meeting the estimated service date due to delays resulting from normal installation procedures.
Such delays shall include, but not be limited to, delays in obtaining right-of-way approvals, delays in actual construction work being done by Spectrum, including its contractors or representatives, and any delays due to any other service provider where Spectrum is relying upon such provider to meet an estimated due date which is beyond Spectrum's control.
- v.
Spectrum offers the use of its facilities for communications between Subscriber and other parties.
Spectrum is not responsible, and shall have no liability, for any communications or miscommunications between Subscriber (including any users) and other parties (including operator-assisted, 911 and E-911 calls).

In establishing connections with other providers, Spectrum is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of other service providers.
d.
Equipment: Spectrum Voice Service requires a voice modem.
Spectrum will supply a voice modem for so long as Subscriber remains a Voice Service Subscriber or until Spectrum changes its Voice Service offering.
Depending on the Spectrum Voice Service plan, there may be a monthly charge for the voice modem.
Upon termination of Spectrum Voice Service for any reason, Subscriber may be asked to return the Spectrum-supplied voice modem within thirty (30) days or Subscriber will be charged an equipment fee equal to the fee charged by Spectrum at the time the voice modem was supplied by Spectrum.
An exception to this return policy is when the modem is also supporting Internet service, in which case Subscriber may continue to use the modem until such time as Internet is no longer provided or Spectrum requests a substitution of the modem.
Equipment and facilities furnished by Spectrum to provide Voice Service (except for inside wiring and inside jacks) are the property of Spectrum.
Telephone numbers assigned to Subscriber by Spectrum are portable and transferable with Subscriber at the same location.

Depending on the location and Subscriber's preference, Spectrum Voice Service may include one (1) basic directory listing in an alphabetical white pages directory, or other comparable online directory, containing an alphabetical list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of all telephone customers in a particular geographic area set by the publisher.
The alphabetical list of customer names is for the purpose of informing interested parties of the telephone number and address of listed customers, and special position or arrangement of names may be provided for an additional charge.
Listings shall conform to the publisher's practices with respect to published directories.
Spectrum limits the length of any listing in the directory by the use of abbreviations when, in Spectrum's opinion, the clarity of the listing or the identification of the customer is not impaired by doing so.
The duration of directory listings, when the listings have been published, is the directory period.
The directory period is from the day on which the directory is first distributed to customers to the day the succeeding directory is first distributed to customers.
Spectrum's liability for directory listing errors or omissions is set out in Section 7, "Limitation of Liability." 7.

4.
Funcionalidad del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum: El Dispositivo usa transmisiones de radio para acceder al Servicio Móvil.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado no está dentro del alcance de una señal de transmisión, es posible que el Servicio Móvil no funcione.
La disponibilidad y calidad del Servicio Móvil pueden verse afectadas por muchos factores, incluyendo el plan de Servicio Móvil adquirido, el Dispositivo, el operador de la red móvil, el uso mensual del Abonado, la capacidad de la red, la congestión de la red o Internet, las velocidades de los servidores de sitios web, las interrupciones de la red, las políticas de administración de la red, el terreno, los edificios, el follaje, el clima, las acciones de terceros u otros problemas similares, y Spectrum no garantiza la disponibilidad de la red móvil ni las velocidades del servicio.
Además, en algunos casos, Spectrum puede reducir las velocidades de descarga o reproducción, resolución de video o uso del servicio de hotspot móvil de Spectrum del Abonado después de que el Abonado alcanza ciertos niveles o cantidades de descargas, conforme a los términos del plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (según se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Por consiguiente, las velocidades reales del Servicio Móvil variarán.
El Servicio Móvil que depende de la información de ubicación, como 911 Mejorado (“E-911”), que puede proporcionar la ubicación de una persona al operador del 911, y la navegación del posicionamiento global por satélite (“GPS”) dependen de la capacidad de un Dispositivo para recibir señales satelitales (generalmente no disponible en ambientes interiores) y la cobertura de la red.
Es posible que el Abonado no pueda usar su Dispositivo de ninguna manera, incluyendo llamar al 911, mientras el dispositivo recibe una actualización de software hasta que la misma se complete.
El Dispositivo del Abonado se puede conectar automáticamente a hotspots WiFi, incluyendo la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su Servicio Spectrum Internet u otros hotspots WiFi disponibles de Spectrum o terceros.

Inhabilitar la función de conexión WiFi automática puede limitar la disponibilidad de algunas funciones del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y/o reducir su utilización de Spectrum Internet, que le proporciona acceso ilimitado a datos, lo que aumenta su uso de datos mensual del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Según su plan de Servicio Móvil, el aumento en el uso de datos del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum puede incrementar sus cargos mensuales o, si se ha suscrito a un plan de Servicio Móvil ilimitado de Spectrum, el mayor uso de datos puede afectar el rendimiento después de que alcance ciertos niveles o cantidades de descarga.

SPECTRUM SE RESERVA EL DERECHO, A SU ENTERA DISCRECIÓN, DE SUSPENDER, CANCELAR O RESTRINGIR DE INMEDIATO EL USO DEL SERVICIO MÓVIL SIN PREVIO AVISO SI DICHO USO VIOLA LAS RESTRICCIONES EN ESTA SECCIÓN 8.
9.
Cargos de Roaming: Roaming significa cobertura en la red de otro operador de red móvil (“Roaming”).
El Servicio Móvil del Abonado se puede utilizar para llamadas internacionales y Roaming.
El Servicio Móvil originado o recibido al estar fuera del Área de Cobertura incluida en el plan de Servicio Móvil está sujeto a cargos de Roaming.
La capacidad de un Dispositivo de conectarse a una red dentro de la cobertura a una fuera de la cobertura depende del Dispositivo del Abonado, del plan de Servicio Móvil y de la disponibilidad de la cobertura de Roaming.
Es posible que algún Servicio Móvil no esté disponible o funcione de la misma manera cuando se utiliza el Roaming (por ejemplo, servicios de datos, correo de voz o llamada en espera).
El uso del Servicio Móvil en Roaming también depende del soporte para la funcionalidad y la tecnología de red aplicables del proveedor de Roaming.
Es posible que haya tarifas más altas y cargos adicionales (se incluyen cargos para larga distancia, cargas adicionales o llamadas que no logran conectarse) para llamadas internacionales o cuando se está en Roaming.
Se le puede informar o no a los Abonados que están utilizando el Roaming o sobre los costos asociados.
El Roaming puede estar limitado o no disponible si más de la mitad del uso del Servicio Móvil mensual del Abonado durante un período de sesenta (60) días consecutivos se hace fuera del Área de Cobertura incluida en el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (como se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Además, Spectrum puede bloquear el servicio del uso de voz, texto y/o datos mientras se utiliza el Roaming en algunos países de la manera que Spectrum considere razonablemente necesario para evitar un uso no estándar, excesivo, ilícito o fraudulento del Servicio Móvil.
10.
Dispositivo Extraviado o Robado: El Abonado acepta llamar de inmediato a Spectrum si su dispositivo se extravía o se lo roban, de modo que el Servicio Móvil se pueda suspender para impedir que otra persona lo use.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado se utiliza después del extravío o del robo, pero antes de que el Abonado haga la denuncia de la pérdida, y el Abonado quiere obtener crédito por los cargos de ese uso, Spectrum revisará la actividad de la cuenta y cualquier otra información que el Abonado quiera que Spectrum considere para demostrar que los cargos no estaban autorizados.
Se le puede solicitar al Abonado que proporcione o que envíe información para respaldar la reclamación.
Spectrum puede agregar el Dispositivo a la “lista de objetos extraviados y robados” para impedir que se use el Dispositivo en cualquier red de operador de red móvil.
Se puede responsabilizar al Abonado por los cargos si este demora en hacer la denuncia del extravío o del robo y no tiene una buena justificación de esa demora, pero el Abonado no tiene que pagar ningún tipo de cargos de Servicio Móvil que este dispute mientras se investiguen los cargos.
Un Dispositivo extraviado o robado no exime al Abonado de la obligación de pago de ningún Plan de Pago del Dispositivo o Plan de Arrendamiento.
Solo para Abonados de California: Si bien el Abonado no es responsable de los cargos que este no autorizó, Spectrum considera que el hecho de que una llamada se haya hecho desde el Dispositivo del Abonado es una prueba de que la llamada fue autorizada.
Los cargos no autorizados pueden incluir llamadas hechas al Dispositivo del Abonado o desde el Dispositivo del Abonado después de que este se extravió o fue robado.
Si el Abonado no informa de inmediato el extravío o el robo, el Abonado puede ser responsable del uso del Servicio Móvil hasta que se denunció el incidente.
Una vez que se informe a Spectrum que el Dispositivo se ha extraviado o ha sido robado, y el Dispositivo está suspendido, el Abonado no será responsable de los cargos posteriores que se originen por el uso de ese Dispositivo.
Si Spectrum no le ha dado al Abonado una suspensión de cortesía de los cargos mensuales recurrentes durante el año anterior, Spectrum le otorgará al Abonado una (1) suspensión por treinta (30) días hasta que el Abonado reemplace o recupere el Dispositivo, lo que ocurra primero.
11.
Privacidad e Información en un Dispositivo: Tal como se describe en la Política de Privacidad de Spectrum, Spectrum, junto con sus socios, puede recopilar información técnica y de servicio de todos los usuarios del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum durante el suministro de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum o del Dispositivo del Abonado.
Dicha información puede incluir el plan de Servicio Móvil e información de funciones, información de uso y descarga de aplicaciones, información del Dispositivo o del equipo, información de rendimiento o tráfico de red, información de uso de Servicio Móvil, datos diagnósticos (que incluye rendimiento del Dispositivo, potencia de la señal, llamadas caídas, falla de datos o información de la fortaleza de la batería) e información de ubicación (que se define a continuación).
Spectrum puede usar esta información técnica y de servicio para proporcionar servicios de datos y de voz móviles, y para mejorar la experiencia de red y la calidad de la experiencia móvil del Abonado.
Un Dispositivo puede contener información personal y confidencial.
Spectrum no es responsable de la información que está guardada en un Dispositivo, lo que incluye información personal o confidencial.
Spectrum recomienda que el Abonado proteja la información personal y confidencial cuando el Dispositivo no está bajo control o posesión del Abonado.
Al entregar un Dispositivo a Spectrum, el Abonado acepta que los empleados, los contratistas o los proveedores de Spectrum pueden acceder a toda la información que hay en un Dispositivo.
Si el Abonado cambia, devuelve o recicla un Dispositivo a través de Spectrum, el Abonado debe retirar todos los datos y la información del Dispositivo antes de entregarlo a Spectrum.
12.
Cargo mensual por servicio: El Abonado acepta pagar el cargo de servicio móvil mensual de Spectrum, el cual está compuesto por diversas tarifas, impuestos y recargos regulatorios o gubernamentales, tales como recargos de fondos para servicios universales a nivel federal o estatal.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho de aumentar o reducir cualquier cargo por el Servicio Móvil que ofrece.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se cancelará en el caso de que el Abonado no pague.
Los cargos mensuales y de uso se facturarán tal como se especifica en el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (que se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Según el Servicio Móvil del Abonado, los cargos por servicios adicionales pueden incluir asistencia de directorio y de operador, correo de voz, desvío de llamadas, llamadas de datos, textos y acceso a Internet.
Spectrum puede cobrar cargos por activación, prepago, reactivación, programa, Dispositivo, Plan de Arrendamiento, cargos de planes de cuotas u otros cargos para establecer, cambiar o mantener el Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Algunas transacciones también pueden estar sujetas a cambios (por ejemplo, facilidad de pago, cambio de números de teléfono o actualizaciones de teléfono).
Spectrum notificará al Abonado si algunas de estas tarifas se aplican a las transacciones solicitadas.
Para determinar el lugar de uso principal (“PPU”, por sus siglas en inglés) del Abonado, y qué impuestos y valoraciones de la jurisdicción se cobran, el Abonado debe proporcionar a Spectrum su dirección residencial.
Si el Abonado no proporciona la dirección a Spectrum, o si la misma queda fuera del Área de Cobertura de Spectrum, Spectrum puede designar de manera razonable un PPU dentro del Área de Cobertura del Abonado.
El Abonado debe vivir y tener una dirección postal dentro del Área de Cobertura de Spectrum.
Si el Abonado intenta usar un Dispositivo en una dirección alternativa, este debe comunicarse con Spectrum al (833) 224-6603 para actualizar el PPU de su cuenta.
13.
Facturación: Al Abonado se le facturarán en forma mensual, por adelantado, los cargos recurrentes por Dispositivo y Servicio Móvil (por ejemplo, cargos por servicio de línea y/o impuestos asociados, cargos por planes de servicios, funciones, uso prepagado, Plan de Pago de Dispositivo Móvil de Spectrum, Plan de Arrendamiento y todo Plan de Protección de Dispositivo comprado), y en mora por cargos de uso (por ejemplo, datos, llamadas internacionales y Roaming).
Es posible que los cargos por Roaming y datos internacionales no aparezcan en un resumen de cuenta durante el ciclo de facturación cuando las llamadas y/o el uso de datos se hicieron debido a las demoras en la recepción y la revisión de dichos registros.
Si el Abonado recibe un Dispositivo o Servicio Móvil en una promoción, una vez que termine el período de la promoción, se aplicarán los precios de mercado que estaban vigentes en ese entonces para el Dispositivo o el Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Para los cargos en función de la cantidad de tiempo utilizado o para los datos enviados o recibidos, Spectrum redondeará las fracciones al siguiente minuto completo o, según cómo se le facture al Abonado por el uso de datos, al siguiente megabyte (“MB”) o gigabyte (“GB”) completos.
Para las llamadas salientes, el tiempo de uso comienza cuando el Abonado presiona ‘ENVIAR’ (o tecla similar) o cuando la llamada se conecta a la red.
y para las llamadas entrantes, comienza cuando la llamada se conecta a la red (que puede ser antes de que suene).
El tiempo de uso puede terminar varios segundos después de que el Abonado presione “FINALIZAR” (o tecla similar) o después de que se desconecta la llamada.
Para las llamadas que se hacen en la red, Spectrum solo cobrará las llamadas que se respondan, lo que incluye las respuestas de contestadores automáticos.
El uso no siempre se puede procesar de inmediato y es posible que se incluya en una factura posterior.
Los Abonados con un plan de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum ilimitado pagarán un cargo mensual por el Servicio de conformidad con los términos de dicho plan.
Para los Abonados con un plan de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum en función de la cantidad de tiempo utilizado y/o de los datos enviados o recibidos, al Abonado se le cobrarán todos los datos enviados, recibidos, consumidos por el Abonado y/o utilizados en la cuenta del Abonado, lo que incluye, entre otros, datos consumidos por las aplicaciones (incluso todo Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y/u otras aplicaciones de Spectrum), widgets, mensajería multimedia, conexión, carga, descarga, streaming de Contenido, acceso a Internet (incluso el acceso a intranets corporativas, correos electrónicos y aplicaciones de productividad individuales), GPS y servicios de localización y voz sobre protocolo de Internet (lo que incluye toda sobrecarga de la red y/o sobrecarga de protocolo de Internet asociado con el Contenido enviado o recibido).
Al final de cada ciclo de facturación, el uso de datos para una cuenta con una sola línea que recibe el Servicio Móvil de manera prepagada se redondeará al siguiente MB o GB, según el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Por ejemplo, si el Abonado utiliza 1.2 GB de datos durante un ciclo de facturación, al Abonado se le facturará un uso de 2 GB.
Al final de cada ciclo de facturación, el uso de datos para una cuenta con varias líneas que recibe el Servicio Móvil de manera prepagada se puede agregar y luego redondear al siguiente GB, según las condiciones del plan de su Servicio Móvil.
Si un Abonado selecciona un plan de Servicio Móvil de una promoción que incluye una asignación predeterminada de Servicio Móvil (por ejemplo, una asignación predeterminada de gigabytes o mensajes), salvo que se establezca específicamente lo contrario como parte de dicho plan de Servicio Móvil, toda asignación no utilizada de Servicio Móvil de un ciclo de facturación no se transferirá a ningún otro ciclo de facturación.
El primer ciclo de facturación del Abonado comenzará al activar el Dispositivo o siete (7) días después de la fecha de envío del Dispositivo, lo que ocurra primero, y la primera factura del Abonado puede incluir cargos mensuales parciales del servicio además de los cargos mencionados anteriormente.
Todas las facturas de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum estarán disponibles a través de la aplicación y el portal de Internet Mi Cuenta.
Al Abonado se le facturará de manera separada por el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum desde cualquier otro servicio de Spectrum, lo que incluye Spectrum Internet o Spectrum TV.
14.
Cambios No Autorizados: EL ABONADO DEBE TENER CUIDADO CUANDO PERMITA QUE OTRA PERSONA, LO QUE INCLUYE UN HIJO U OTRO MENOR, USE UN DISPOSITIVO DE SU CUENTA.
El Abonado está obligado a pagar todos los cargos en los que incurra, incluso los cargos de cualquier otro usuario de un Dispositivo asociado con la cuenta del Abonado.
Se puede acceder a muchos servicios y aplicaciones en o a través de un Dispositivo, lo que incluye compras de juegos, películas, música y otro tipo de Contenido.
Algunos de estos servicios son provistos por Spectrum.
Otros son provistos por terceros que pueden ofrecer la opción de cargos de facturación a la factura de Spectrum del Abonado u otros métodos de pago.
Los cargos pueden ser únicos o recurrentes.
Si al comprador se le permite que se le facturen los cargos en la cuenta del Abonado y se elige esta opción, dichos cargos formarán parte del monto adeudado para ese ciclo de facturación.
El Abonado es exclusivamente responsable de todos los cargos a dichos terceros, lo que incluye todas las tarifas correspondientes.
Además, el Abonado es el único responsable de proteger la seguridad de la tarjeta de crédito y de otro tipo de información personal provista a otros en relación con dichas transacciones.
Spectrum puede aceptar brindar servicios de facturación en nombre de terceros, como agente de ese tercero.
Spectrum no será responsable de ninguna disputa con respecto a los cargos entre el Abonado y un tercero.
El Abonado debe resolver todas estas disputas directamente con el tercero.
15.
Derecho de Spectrum de limitar o finalizar el Servicio Móvil o este Acuerdo: Spectrum puede, con o sin aviso, limitar, suspender o finalizar el Servicio Móvil del Abonado o cualquier acuerdo con el Abonado por cualquier causa justificada, las que incluyen, entre otras: (1) si el Abonado: (a) incumple este Acuerdo.

(e) roba o miente a Spectrum.
(f) no paga su factura de cualquiera de los servicios de Spectrum a tiempo.
(g) incurre en cargos mayores que el Depósito requerido o límite de facturación, o que significativamente exceden sus cargos de acceso mensual (incluso si Spectrum aún no ha facturado los cargos).
o (h) no puede pagar Spectrum o se declara en quiebra.
o (2) si el Abonado o cualquier usuario del Dispositivo del Abonado, o cualquier línea de Servicio Móvil en la cuenta del Abonado: (a) amenaza o acosa a los representantes de Spectrum, o se dirige a estos en un lenguaje vulgar y/o inapropiado.
(b) interfiere con las operaciones de Spectrum.
(c) “envía correos no deseados” o participa de cualquier otro tipo de mensajería de tipo abusiva.
(d) modifica su Dispositivo para cambiar las especificaciones del fabricante.
o (e) utiliza el Servicio Móvil del Abonado de manera tal que tiene un efecto negativo en la red o en otros clientes, o que viola las restricciones que se mencionan en la Sección 8 de arriba.
Spectrum también puede limitar de manera temporaria el Servicio Móvil del Abonado por cualquier razón operativa o gubernamental.
Los derechos de Spectrum en esta sección son adicionales a los derechos específicos que Spectrum se reserva en otras disposiciones de este Acuerdo o en otras Condiciones del Servicio para interrumpir, suspender, modificar o cancelar el Servicio Móvil del Abonado y para cancelar el Acuerdo del Abonado.
16.
Transferencia: El Abonado puede traspasar o “transferir” su número de teléfono móvil a otro operador de red móvil.
Si el Abonado transfiere un número desde Spectrum, Spectrum considerará que el Abonado solicita a Spectrum la cancelación del Servicio Móvil del Abonado para ese número.
Una vez que se complete la transferencia, el Abonado ya no podrá usar el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para ese número, pero el Abonado seguirá siendo responsable de todas las tarifas y los cargos de Servicio Móvil en los que incurrió hasta el final de ese ciclo de facturación, y de todos los cargos de Dispositivos, al igual que cualquier otro tipo de cancelación.
Si el Abonado transfiere un número a Spectrum, es posible que Spectrum no pueda brindar de inmediato algunos servicios, como por ejemplo los servicios E-911.
El Abonado reconoce y acepta que, salvo que lo exija una ley correspondiente, el Abonado no tiene derechos exclusivos sobre el número de móvil que Spectrum le asigne, salvo el derecho que el Abonado pueda tener para transferir el número.
17.
Información de Ubicación: El Dispositivo del Abonado o el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum pueden determinar la ubicación geográfica física del Dispositivo y del Abonado (“Información de Ubicación”).
Tal como se describe en la Política de Privacidad de Spectrum, Spectrum, junto con sus socios, puede recopilar automáticamente Información de Ubicación u otros datos del cliente durante el suministro de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Spectrum, junto con sus socios y/o proveedor de servicio de red, pueden usar esta Información de Ubicación, datos del cliente e información de uso y rendimiento que se obtiene de la red o del Dispositivo del Abonado para suministrar servicios móviles de datos y de voz, y para mejorar la experiencia de la red y de la calidad del servicio móvil del Abonado.
La Información de Ubicación también se puede utilizar para crear datos globales de los cuales la información de carácter personal ha sido eliminada u ocultada.
Estos datos globales se pueden utilizar para una variedad de fines (por ejemplo, para investigación científica y de marketing, volumen de tráfico de vehículos y monitoreo).
Es responsabilidad del Abonado notificar a los usuarios de su cuenta que la información de uso del Servicio Móvil o de los Dispositivos de dichos usuarios vinculados con la cuenta del Abonado puede ser recopilada.
El Dispositivo del Abonado también puede usar Contenido opcional a solicitud del Abonado o a solicitud de un usuario en la cuenta del Abonado, ofrecido por Spectrum o terceros que usan la Información de ubicación del Dispositivo (“Servicio en Función de la Ubicación”).
El Abonado debe revisar los términos y las condiciones, y la política de privacidad relacionada para cada Servicio en función de la ubicación para saber cómo se utilizará y protegerá la información de ubicación.
Si el Abonado no quiere que el Servicio en función de la ubicación recopile o use la Información de ubicación, deberá desactivar los servicios de localización en el Dispositivo mediante las configuraciones del Dispositivo.
18.
911 y Alertas de Emergencia: Cuando se hacen llamadas a un punto de respuesta de seguridad pública (“PSAP”, por sus siglas en inglés) desde un Dispositivo, como por ejemplo cuando se marca el 911, el Abonado siempre debe estar preparado para brindar su ubicación y número de teléfono.
A diferencia de un teléfono fijo tradicional, un PSAP puede no conocer el número de teléfono o la ubicación de la persona que llama.
Si bien algunas autoridades de emergencia a nivel local han activado los servicios E-911 que usan GPS u otros métodos para determinar las ubicaciones de las personas que llaman, el E-911 no siempre brinda información de localización precisa.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado está en el interior, no puede obtener la señal satelital o no puede obtener la ubicación de la persona que llama, es posible que la Información de ubicación no se transmita automáticamente al PSAP.
Además, el proceso de transferencia de un número de teléfono puede impedir que el Servicio Móvil brinde servicios de ubicación al PSAP durante ese tiempo.
Si el Abonado hace una llamada al 911, el operador puede ver un número de teléfono que es diferente del número de teléfono personal del Abonado.
En algunos casos, puede ocurrir que el PSAP no pueda volver a llamar al Abonado.
Las llamadas al 911 a través de WiFi o una conexión de datos pueden funcionar de manera diferente a las llamadas al 911 desde teléfonos fijos tradicionales.
Es posible que estas llamadas no se conecten al PSAP, puedan ser limitadas o puedan no estar disponibles si el Abonado está experimentando un corte de energía, si hay una interrupción del servicio de Wi-Fi o en la conexión de datos, o si el Abonado no puede tener acceso a Internet.
Si la llamada del Abonado se conecta al PSAP, es posible que su información de ubicación y número de teléfono no se transmitan.
Además, si el Abonado no ha actualizado su dirección 911 de emergencia en las configuraciones de su Dispositivo, el Dispositivo puede proporcionar un PSAP con Información de ubicación que sea diferente a la ubicación de llamada del Abonado.
El Abonado debe estar preparado para brindar su ubicación y número de teléfono al PSAP.
Si el Abonado es sordo, tiene problemas de audición o de habla y necesita comunicarse con los servicios de emergencia, el Abonado debe llamar directamente al 911 mediante el TTY o el servicio de retransmisión de telecomunicaciones.
Spectrum también puede proporcionar servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos en partes de su Área de Cobertura en dispositivos que admitan alertas de emergencia.
No se cobran cargos adicionales por estos servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos.
Es posible que los servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos no estén disponibles en todos los Dispositivos o en toda el Área de Cobertura, o si el Abonado se encuentra fuera del Área de Cobertura.
En las áreas en que se transmiten las alertas de emergencia, es posible que dichas alertas no sean recibidas por un Abonado o usuario del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, incluso si el usuario tiene un Dispositivo con capacidad para recibirlas.
19.

FINALMENTE, SPECTRUM, Y SUS PROVEEDORES DE SERVICIO, NO SERÁN RESPONSABLES DE NINGUNA PÉRDIDA O INTERRUPCIÓN DEL SERVICIO MÓVIL NI POR NINGÚN DAÑO O PÉRDIDA DEBIDO A LA FALLA O NEGLIGENCIA DEL ABONADO, CUALQUIER USUARIO DEL ABONADO O CUALQUIER OTRO TERCERO O PERSONA, O DEBIDO A LA FALLA O MAL FUNCIONAMIENTO DEL EQUIPO O LAS INSTALACIONES PROPORCIONADOS POR EL ABONADO O EL USUARIO, O DEBIDO AL INCUMPLIMIENTO POR PARTE DEL ABONADO DE CUALQUIER OBLIGACIÓN ESTABLECIDA EN ESTE ACUERDO.
EL PROVEEDOR O LOS PROVEEDORES DE SERVICIOS MÓVILES DE SPECTRUM NO TENDRÁN NINGÚN TIPO DE RESPONSABILIDAD POR PÉRDIDAS, RECLAMACIONES O DEMANDAS DEL ABONADO, LO QUE INCLUYE A MODO ENUNCIATIVO PERO NO LIMITATIVO, FALLA O INTERRUPCIÓN DEL SERVICIO MÓVIL PROVISTO AQUÍ, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE LA FORMA DE ACCIÓN, YA SEA POR CONTRATO, AGRAVIO O DE OTRO MODO.

SPECTRUM NO GARANTIZA QUE EL DISPOSITIVO O EL SERVICIO MÓVIL DEL ABONADO FUNCIONARÁN PERFECTAMENTE O QUE NO TENDRÁN INTERRUPCIONES O VIRUS.
SPECTRUM NO GARANTIZA QUE EL DISPOSITIVO DEL ABONADO NO NECESITARÁ ACTUALIZACIONES O MODIFICACIONES OCASIONALES, O QUE NO SE VERÁ AFECTADO NEGATIVAMENTE POR MODIFICACIONES, ACTUALIZACIONES O ACTIVIDADES SIMILARES RELACIONADAS CON LA RED.
SPECTRUM NO GARANTIZA QUE LOS CORREOS DE VOZ, LOS MENSAJES O CUALQUIER OTRA INFORMACIÓN (LO QUE INCLUYE VIDEOS E IMÁGENES) SE CONSERVARÁN SI SPECTRUM BRINDA SERVICIOS AL DISPOSITIVO DEL ABONADO.
SPECTRUM NO GARANTIZA QUE LAS COMUNICACIONES DEL ABONADO SERÁN PRIVADAS O SEGURAS.
ES ILEGAL QUE PERSONAS NO AUTORIZADAS INTERCEPTEN LAS COMUNICACIONES DEL ABONADO, PERO ESAS INTERCEPCIONES PUEDEN OCURRIR Y SPECTRUM NO TIENE NINGUNA RESPONSABILIDAD POR ESE TIPO DE HECHOS.

• Priorización pagada El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no favorece de manera directa o indirecta a parte del tráfico sobre otro tráfico, incluso mediante el uso de técnicas como modelado del tráfico, priorización o reserva de recursos, a cambio de consideración, compensación monetaria o de otro tipo.
• Administración de la congestión En la red móvil.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se esfuerza por ofrecer a sus clientes la mejor experiencia cuando utilizan la red de nuestro MNP.
Sin embargo, la experiencia de un usuario individual variará según muchos factores, incluyendo la red de MNP (3G Ev-DO o 4G LTE) que el cliente esté utilizando y el dispositivo móvil ("dispositivo") en uso.
Nuestro MNP usa tecnologías de optimización y transcodificación en las redes 3G Ev-DO y 4G LTE para transmitir archivos de datos de manera más eficiente para permitir que la capacidad de red disponible beneficie a la mayor cantidad de usuarios.
Estas técnicas incluyen menos almacenamiento en cache de datos, usar menos capacidad y ajustar el tamaño de los archivos de video de manera más apropiada para los dispositivos móviles.
Estas técnicas son independientes del contenido en sí y del sitio web que lo proporciona.
Si bien estas técnicas pretenden evitar cambios en archivos de texto, imágenes y video, y aunque es probable que el cliente no pueda detectar cambios en el archivo, el proceso de optimización puede tener un impacto mínimo en la apariencia del archivo tal como se muestra en el dispositivo móvil del cliente.
En WiFi.
Cuando los clientes del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se conectan a través de WiFi, las prácticas de administración de la congestión aplicables a esa conexión variarán según el proveedor de servicio de Internet ("ISP").
En los hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, Spectrum utiliza prácticas razonables de administración de la red que cumplen con las normas de la industria.
Puede obtener información adicional sobre las prácticas de Spectrum en cuanto a la administración de la congestión aquí.
Spectrum no es responsable de las técnicas de administración de la congestión que usan otros ISP para sus redes WiFi.
Si su dispositivo se conecta con la red WiFi de otro ISP, debe consultar las condiciones del servicio y divulgaciones del ancho de banda de ese proveedor para obtener información sobre sus prácticas.
Las técnicas de optimización y transcodificación descritas anteriormente en el punto En la red móvil no se aplican cuando un dispositivo está utilizando WiFi de Spectrum (y no pueden ser utilizados por otros proveedores de servicios WiFi) para transmitir datos y, por lo tanto, los archivos de texto, imágenes y video se transmitirán por WiFi a la resolución nativa.
Roaming.
Para aquellas áreas geográficas que no cuentan con servicios de red móvil administrados por y de propiedad de nuestros MNP, los MNP celebran acuerdos con otros proveedores de red móvil.
El uso de dispositivos de los clientes para acceder a datos a través de las redes de otro proveedor, tanto nacionales como internacionales, se denomina uso de "roaming".
Nuestra capacidad para hacer que los servicios estén disponibles para los clientes en estas otras redes móviles se basa en una variedad de factores dinámicos, que incluyen consideraciones comerciales, los términos de los acuerdos que nuestros MNP tienen en un momento determinado con otros proveedores de redes móviles, la tecnología de la red, la(s) frecuencia(s) y la funcionalidad de esas redes.
El uso del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum en roaming depende del soporte para la funcionalidad y la tecnología de red aplicables del proveedor de roaming.
Consulte con proveedores de redes de roaming de forma individual para conocer detalles de compatibilidad y cobertura.
Los dispositivos pueden transmitir y recibir mensajes de datos sin la intervención del usuario y pueden generar cargos inesperados cuando están "encendidos" fuera de los Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de EE.
UU.
Algunos países y/o proveedores dentro de una zona con servicio de roaming pueden no estar disponibles durante el roaming.
No garantizamos la disponibilidad, calidad de cobertura o velocidad de los servicios de roaming a los que se accede a través de otras redes de proveedores de redes móviles y podemos reducir las velocidades a 2G o suspender el servicio de roaming disponible en estas redes en cualquier momento sin previo aviso.
• Conducta específica de cada aplicación Puede acceder a cualquier aplicación legal para usar en el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, sujeta a nuestros Términos y Condiciones Generales del Servicio Residencial, Prácticas de Administración de la Red, Acuerdo de Servicios Móviles Residenciales de Spectrum y la Política de Privacidad tratados en estas divulgaciones.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho de intervenir en todo momento para proteger la integridad de sus servicios, incluyendo el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, y la red.
Si bien Spectrum no favorece a ciertos sitios web o aplicaciones de Internet al bloquear, reducir la velocidad o modificar protocolos particulares, puertos de protocolo o campos de protocolo en formas no establecidas por las normas de protocolo, podemos evitar el uso de ciertos puertos en nuestro servicio WiFi de Spectrum que se utilizan comúnmente para propagar malware y participar en otras actividades maliciosas.
• Normas para dispositivos accesorios Puede activar dispositivos que Charter ha certificado que son compatibles con su red, incluidos los dispositivos que no se compraron directamente a Charter.
Aquí está disponible una herramienta para comprobar si su dispositivo actual está aprobado para su uso en nuestra red.
Puede encontrar información sobre cómo obtener un dispositivo móvil, incluyendo la lista de dispositivos móviles aprobados y sus precios, aquí.
Según la capacidad de su dispositivo móvil, está permitido usar el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para crear un hotspot móvil a fin de conectarse con otros dispositivos conforme a los términos, las condiciones y las opciones de precios de datos de su Servicio Móvil de Spectrum (consulte las Condiciones comerciales a continuación) y sujeto a las prácticas y los controles de administración de la red de nuestros MNP.
• Seguridad Spectrum reconoce que una red confiable debe ser, entre otras cosas, una red segura.
Nosotros, junto con nuestro MNP, trabajamos para proteger la red contra ataques externos, alteraciones, actividad maliciosa y eventos de red que de alguna manera puedan interrumpir o deteriorar la capacidad de los clientes del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para usar la red.
Nuestro MNP bloquea una cantidad limitada de direcciones de Internet que son disruptivas o maliciosas y generalmente persistentes, con base en el análisis y la inteligencia de terceros.
Nuestro MNP no bloquea los sitios por el contenido o el tema, a menos que la dirección de Internet aloje contenido ilegal.
Nuestro MNP revisa y modifica regularmente la lista de direcciones de Internet bloqueadas, eliminando cualquiera que ya no se percibe como una amenaza.
Características de rendimiento • Descripción del servicio En la red móvil.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum ofrece a sus clientes servicios de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil a través de redes de banda ancha móvil 3G Ev-DO y 4G LTE.
Según pruebas internas y pruebas solicitadas a proveedores externos de nuestro MNP, Spectrum espera que los clientes cuenten con las siguientes velocidades en el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum: • Red 4G LTE: velocidad de descarga normal de 5-12 megabits por segundo (Mbps) y velocidad de carga de 2-5 Mbps.
• Red 3G Ev-DO: velocidad de descarga normal de 600 kilobits por segundo (Kbps)-1.4 Mbps y velocidad de carga de 500-800 Kbps para dispositivos Ev-DO Rev.
A (si utiliza un dispositivo Ev-DO Rev.
0, la velocidad de descarga normal es de 400-700 Kbps y de carga 60-80 Kbps).
La reproducción de video con calidad de DVD admite velocidad 4G (generalmente, el video se reproduce en 480p).
Con respecto a la latencia en el uso de aplicaciones con datos en tiempo real, nuestro MNP espera que la latencia de red a dispositivo móvil (y viceversa) sea inferior a 100 milisegundos (ms) en la red 4G de nuestro MNP y menos de 240 ms en su red 3G Ev -DO.
La latencia es el tiempo de demora en la transmisión o recepción de paquetes en una red.
La latencia es principalmente una función de la distancia entre dos puntos en la transmisión, pero también puede verse afectada por la cantidad y la calidad de las conexiones a la red o redes utilizadas en la transmisión.
Actualmente, nuestro MNP no informa datos de pérdida de paquetes, por lo que el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no tiene la capacidad técnica de medir la pérdida de paquetes en la red.
La pérdida de paquetes es el porcentaje de paquetes que envía el origen pero no los recibe el destino.
Esto a veces se debe a la congestión a lo largo de la ruta pero también puede reflejar un deterioro en la red.
Debe usar un dispositivo móvil 4G LTE y estar en el área de cobertura 4G LTE de nuestro MNP para acceder a su red 4G LTE.
Debe usar un dispositivo móvil que admita 3G Ev-DO y estar en el área de cobertura 3G Ev-DO de nuestro MNP para acceder a su red 3G Ev-DO.
Para obtener información sobre la cobertura 4G y 3G, haga clic aquí.
Los clientes con dispositivos 4G LTE tendrán acceso a la red 3G Ev-DO donde esté disponible fuera del área de cobertura 4G LTE.
Las velocidades reales que experimente en la red de nuestro MNP dependerán de muchos factores, incluidos, entre otros, el tipo de dispositivo móvil, los programas que se ejecutan en el dispositivo móvil, su ubicación y cuántos otros clientes están intentando utilizar los mismos recursos del espectro (incluyendo el acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil y otros servicios de acceso a Internet sin banda ancha que comparten la red).
En WiFi de Spectrum.
Los resultados anteriores no reflejan el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum experimentado por los clientes conectados a hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet).
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se puede conectar automáticamente a hotspots WiFi de Spectrum (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet) cuando esté disponible a menos que el cliente cambie la configuración del dispositivo móvil para inhabilitar dicha funcionalidad.
El rendimiento en cualquier red WiFi, incluyendo hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, puede variar en función de varios factores, tales como, aunque no exclusivamente, la cantidad de otros abonados que intentan usar el mismo enrutador WiFi al mismo tiempo, su dispositivo móvil, su antena de recepción WiFi, su distancia hasta el enrutador WiFi, la atenuación de las paredes y el follaje, y la interferencia de otros dispositivos móviles que utilizan el mismo espectro.
WiFi usa el espectro que la FCC ha asignado para el uso "sin licencia", lo que significa que el uso de este espectro no está protegido de la interferencia de otros dispositivos móviles que usan el mismo espectro en la misma área geográfica.
Por lo tanto, los hotspots Wi-Fi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, así como cualquier conexión WiFi a través del servicio Spectrum Internet de su hogar, se brindan haciendo los "mejores esfuerzos".
Cuando no esté conectado a hotspots Wi-Fi de Spectrum fuera del hogar (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet), el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum intentará conectarse a través de la red del servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil de nuestro MNP.
Puede encontrar información adicional sobre WiFi de Spectrum en nuestras Prácticas de Administración de la Red, nuestra Política de Uso Autorizado de Internet y el Acuerdo del Servicio de Internet Residencial, cada uno de los cuales está incorporado en nuestros Términos y Condiciones Generales del Servicio Residencial.
• Otros servicios en la red El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum usa la red del servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil de nuestro MNP y comparte esa red con esos servicios y otros servicios de acceso a Internet sin banda ancha que ofrece nuestro MNP.
Al acceder al Servicio Móvil de Spectrum a través de un punto de acceso WiFi de Spectrum, se ofrecerá un servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha y un servicio de Voz sobre WiFi a través del punto de acceso.
Al acceder al Servicio Móvil de Spectrum a través de otra red WiFi, los usuarios pueden compartir esas redes WiFi con otros servicios que Spectrum no conoce ni administra.
Como tal, el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no puede predecir otros servicios que pueden compartir la red WiFi.
Condiciones comerciales • Precios, uso de datos y otros cargos El servicio no está disponible en todas las áreas.
