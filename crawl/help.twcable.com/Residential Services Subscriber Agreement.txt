A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of intent to arbitrate, entitled "Notice of Intent to Arbitrate" ("Notice").
The Notice to Spectrum should be addressed to: VP and Associate General Counsel, Litigation, Charter Communications, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St.
Louis, MO 63131 ("Arbitration Notice Address").
The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, Subscriber or Spectrum may commence an arbitration proceeding, in which all issues are for the arbitrator to decide (including the scope of the arbitration clause), but the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of these General Terms.
The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these General Terms, and the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "www.adr.org," by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address.
SPECTRUM SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ANY ARBITRATION FILING FEES AND ARBITRATOR'S FEES FOR CLAIMS OF UP TO $75,000.
SUBSCRIBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OTHER ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT SUBSCRIBER INCURS IN THE ARBITRATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS FEES OR EXPERT WITNESS COSTS UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED OF SPECTRUM UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
If the arbitrator's award exceeds $75,000, either party may appeal such award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA and selected according to the AAA Rules, by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days after the date of entry of the arbitration award.
The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.
The three-arbitrator panel must issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which may exist under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The parties may agree that arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.
SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, SUBSCRIBER AND SPECTRUM ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY Unless Spectrum and Subscriber agree otherwise in writing, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place in the county (or parish) of Subscriber's billing address.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking relief, only to the extent sought, and only to the extent necessary to provide the specific relief warranted by such individual's claim.
The parties agree that the arbitrator must give effect to the terms of these General Terms.
SUBSCRIBER AND SPECTRUM AGREE THAT CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN SUBSCRIBER'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF, OR AS PART OF, A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING Furthermore, unless both Subscriber and Spectrum agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

Subscriber's written notification to Spectrum must include Subscriber's name, address, and Spectrum account number as well as a clear statement that Subscriber does not wish to resolve disputes with Spectrum through arbitration.
Subscriber's decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on Subscriber's relationship with Spectrum or the delivery of Services to Subscriber by Spectrum.
Severability.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT SOME OR ALL OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence only, in the event such waiver is found to be unenforceable, it shall be severed from these General Terms, rendered null and void and of no further effect without affecting the rest of the arbitration provisions set forth herein.
EXCLUSIONS.

This agreement (the "Agreement") is a binding legal document that may be amended unilaterally by Spectrum with or without notice to Subscriber.
Spectrum regularly updates and amends these Terms of Service.
Subscriber should consult Spectrum's website www.spectrum.com to be sure Subscriber remains in compliance.
1.
Services Provided: Spectrum Voice Service provides unlimited and/or measured calling within the United States and to those countries and US territories described in calling plans identified in the applicable Price Guide, in accordance with these terms and conditions.
Subscribers must reside in an area where Spectrum is authorized to provide Voice Service and where, in Spectrum's sole discretion, it is technically and operationally feasible.
Residential Voice Service is only intended for use by Subscriber, Subscriber's family and guests, and persons residing at Subscriber's residential premises, including persons temporarily subleasing Subscriber's residential premises.
2.
Monthly Service Fee: Subscriber agrees to pay the monthly service charge for Spectrum Voice Service which is comprised of various fees and related taxes and surcharges.
Spectrum reserves the right to increase or decrease any fee for Voice Service offered.
Fees for Spectrum Voice Service shall be posted in the applicable Price Guide at www.spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." Spectrum Voice Service will be terminated in the event Subscriber does not pay.
Certain fees for Spectrum Voice Service are based upon periodic studies that analyze the intrastate, interstate and international minutes of all customers purchasing Voice Service.
3.
Voice Service Features: Spectrum Voice Service is offered with the features below.
a.
Calling and Features: Includes local, regional and/or long distance calling within the United States and to those countries and US territories described in calling plans identified in the applicable Price Guide, along with those calling features pertaining to each calling plan.
Feature availability may vary by service area.
A detailed list of features and calling plans may be found in the Price Guide at www.spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." Direct dialed calls outside the coverage of any calling plan are available with per-minute charges or with one of Spectrum's International calling plans.
Existing Subscribers who may purchase a plan other than a plan described in this Agreement, can find a description of their plan in the Price Guide.
b.
E-911: Enhanced 911 ("E-911") is a feature of Spectrum Voice Service that allows emergency operators to automatically receive the telephone number and address of the dialing party.
This E-911 feature has certain requirements in order to operate, as well as certain limitations: - i.
IMPORTANT: The emergency service provider handling the E-911 call, and the address the emergency service provider will see, are linked to the service address Spectrum has on file when Subscriber originally signed up for service.
If Subscriber does not correctly identify where Subscriber's voice modem is actually located, or if the voice modem is moved away from the original service address, Subscriber's E-911 calls may be misdirected to the wrong location(s) or to the wrong emergency service provider(s).
Therefore, in order to have E-911 calls routed correctly, Subscriber agrees not to move the voice modem from the service address at which it was installed by Spectrum and acknowledges responsibility to promptly notify Spectrum of any change in service address prior to moving the voice modem.
- ii.
IMPORTANT: Keeping Your Phone Number: Please be aware that during the first 72 hours of arriving at Subscriber's new service address, if Subscriber dials 911 from their Spectrum Voice Service, Subscriber must relay to the emergency service operator the new (current) service address.
This is necessary to ensure emergency services are dispatched to Subscriber's new service address and not the old service address in the event the emergency services operator may not have the new location in their records.
- iii.
Spectrum Voice Service does not have its own power supply.
If there is a power outage, or if there is a disruption to the cable network or facilities, the Voice Service will not work.
Subscriber expressly acknowledges that in such cases it will not be possible to place or receive calls including calls to access emergency 911 services.
- iv.
If Subscriber chooses, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with the voice modem by calling Spectrum at 1-888-438-2427.
Each battery backup is designed to provide standby power for the battery life chosen by the Subscriber, and at least 5 hours of "talk" time, during a power outage at Subscriber's residence that is not also a network-related outage.
- v.
In some locations, E-911 service may not yet be available.
Such services are dependent on the equipment and facilities of the local governments in which Spectrum provides Voice Service.
In such cases, regular 911 service will be available and Subscriber will need to convey the location information to the emergency operator.
c.
Number of Lines: Subscribers to Spectrum Voice Service can purchase up to two (2) lines at their service address.
d.
Installation: Spectrum Voice Service offers professional installation and self-installation (not available in all areas).
- i.
Professional installation includes activation of all existing working phone jacks or the installation and activation of one phone jack if there is not currently a working phone jack in Subscriber's residence.
Additional wiring charges may apply if Subscriber requests additional jacks to be installed or activated.
Additional charges may also apply for special construction needed to complete the installation.
Spectrum also provides and installs a voice modem, or Multimedia Terminal Adaptor (MTA), that is used to communicate with our private communications network.
- ii.
Self-installation (not available in all areas) provides the option for the Subscriber to pick-up a voice modem or MTA from a Spectrum retail location or have that equipment shipped to their home.
Upon receipt of the equipment, the Subscriber must follow self-installation instructions provided by Spectrum.
In order to qualify for self-installation the following installation conditions must be met: Subscriber's home's phone system must consist of a base unit with any additional cordless phones supported by the base unit.
Subscriber's alarm, security and fax systems must not be dependent on Spectrum Voice Service.
Subscriber's most recent voice provider was Spectrum, or Subscriber has had active Spectrum services in the last 2 years.
and Subscriber will not need outlets moved or added.
Spectrum does not provide a handset.
Subscriber is responsible for maintaining all inside wire and phones within the home.
Subscriber has the option of Spectrum's Wire Maintenance Insurance that may help avoid costly repair charges.
For a low monthly fee, we can provide repair service for Subscriber's jacks and inside wiring.
(The wiring must meet certified technical standards.) Wire maintenance is included in some bundles.
For more information about Wire Maintenance Insurance, go online to Spectrum's Wire Maintenance plan information at www.spectrum.net/wiremaintenance.
In certain buildings such as multiple dwelling units, Spectrum's technicians may not have access to Subscriber's inside wiring located within the multiple dwelling unit.
In these instances, Spectrum has the right to determine how best to wire Subscriber's residence, subject to additional applicable charges.
e.
International Calling: Spectrum Voice Service offers a per minute calling plan for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses to use this service Subscriber will be charged for direct-dial international calls in addition to the flat monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Spectrum Voice Service.
Spectrum Voice Service also offers optional flat rate international calling plans for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses an international plan, Subscriber will be charged a flat monthly fee for direct-dial international calls in addition to the monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Voice Service.
After Subscriber's monthly international calling plan minutes are used, unless Subscriber's plan includes unlimited international calling, each additional minute will be charged at a per-minute rate.
For both per-minute international calling and international calling plans, calls are measured in increments of one minute.
All calls which are a fraction of a minute are rounded up to the next whole minute.
Timing on completed calls begins when the call is answered by the called party.
Answering is determined when call signaling provided by the terminating local carrier, and/or any intermediate carrier(s), so indicate.
Timing terminates on all calls when the calling party hangs up or when Spectrum's network receives a termination signal from the terminating local carrier and/or any intermediate carrier(s).
Unused minutes per month do not roll over to the next month.
You may access international rates and information about international calling plans online at www.spectrum.net/rates.
f.
Voice Service Modifications: Spectrum may, from time to time, offer additional Voice Service features or functionality, or discontinue certain Voice Service features or functionality.
Information about these features or functions will be available in the applicable Price Guide at www.Spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." These additional Voice Services features or functions may be subject to additional specific terms and conditions, and may be subject to change at any time by Spectrum.
g.
Caller Name: Spectrum Voice Service will associate Subscriber's name on the Spectrum account to the telephone number to be displayed in association with the caller name lookup services ("CNAM") provided as part of the Voice Service for all calls made from any of the Spectrum telephone numbers on the account.
In the event that Subscriber wishes to modify the caller name associated with the CNAM, Subscriber agrees to the following: caller name submission(s) shall not mislead or impersonate any person or company.
caller name submission(s) shall not contain false information and shall accurately represent the name of the person that subscribes to the Voice Service and that is included in directory listings, if any.
caller name submission(s) shall not contain abusive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, racist or any other language objectionable to any person or entity as determined by Spectrum, in its sole discretion.
and caller name submission(s) shall comply with all relevant laws, rules and regulations.
4.
Voice Service Limitations: a.
Service Outages: The Spectrum Voice Service modem is electrically powered and will not work in a power outage or if the broadband connection is disrupted or not operating.
In the event of power outages, the modem, including all phones and Voice Services connected to or powered by it, will not work.
Power outages will disrupt E-911 service and the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between a home security system and central monitoring services.
To reduce this risk, Subscriber may choose to purchase a battery backup for use in the event of a non-network related outage.
b.
Home Security Systems: Although Spectrum Voice Service will supply a connection that will allow the operation of Subscriber's existing home security system, Spectrum does not guarantee that any such system will be in complete operational order following the installation of the Voice Service.
As such, it is Subscriber's obligation to contact their home security system provider to inform them of Spectrum Voice Service installation, and any change in phone number, and to request a complete operational test of their system immediately following installation of the Voice Service.
In addition, it is Subscriber's responsibility to test their system on a regular basis.
In the event of a power outage or network outage (whether unplanned or maintenance related), Subscriber's Voice Service, including any home security system which uses the Voice Service to connect to central station monitoring, will not function.
As set forth in Section 3(b)(iv) above, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with their voice modem in the instance of a non-network related outage.
Like any other communications service provider, we do not represent that our service is fail-safe.
In addition, Spectrum prohibits the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between medical alert systems and a central station monitoring service, and will neither connect to such services nor provide technical support for the connection.
c.
Additional Limitations: - i.
Currently, certain operator-assisted services such as busy line verification and busy line interruption, dial around services (10-10-XXX), pay services (900 and 976 services), and third party billing are not offered with Voice Service.
- ii.
If Subscriber receives Voicemail, Subscriber may be eligible for voice-to-text or voice-to-email ("Readable Voicemail") as part of the Voicemail feature.
As a result of the voice-recognition software used by Spectrum, some processed messages may not be fully transcribed and will appear as incomplete messages.
In such cases, Subscriber may obtain the full message by listening to the Readable Voicemail message.
As a condition of using the voice-to-text or voice-to-email feature, Subscriber consents to allow Spectrum, or its service vendors, to process those voice files and to use voicemail messages, and other data associated with such messages, to enhance and/or improve the feature.
- iii.
Spectrum's obligation to furnish Voice Services is dependent upon its ability to secure and retain, without unreasonable expense, suitable facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance of the necessary facilities and equipment.
Spectrum may limit communications, refuse to provide Voice Services or discontinue Voice Services when necessary because of: (i) the lack of transmission medium, transmission capacity or any other facilities or equipment.
(ii) the lack of available services from, or interconnection with, the services or facilities of service providers.
or (iii) any cause beyond Spectrum's control.
- iv.
Spectrum shall use reasonable efforts to make Voice Services available by the estimated service date.
Spectrum shall not be liable for any damages resulting from delays in meeting the estimated service date due to delays resulting from normal installation procedures.
Such delays shall include, but not be limited to, delays in obtaining right-of-way approvals, delays in actual construction work being done by Spectrum, including its contractors or representatives, and any delays due to any other service provider where Spectrum is relying upon such provider to meet an estimated due date which is beyond Spectrum's control.
- v.
Spectrum offers the use of its facilities for communications between Subscriber and other parties.
Spectrum is not responsible, and shall have no liability, for any communications or miscommunications between Subscriber (including any users) and other parties (including operator-assisted, 911 and E-911 calls).
- vi.
At Spectrum's discretion, facilities of other service providers may be used in establishing connections to points not reached by Spectrum's facilities.
In establishing connections with other providers, Spectrum is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of other service providers.
d.
Equipment: Spectrum Voice Service requires a voice modem.
Spectrum will supply a voice modem for so long as Subscriber remains a Voice Service Subscriber or until Spectrum changes its Voice Service offering.
Depending on the Spectrum Voice Service plan, there may be a monthly charge for the voice modem.
Upon termination of Spectrum Voice Service for any reason, Subscriber may be asked to return the Spectrum-supplied voice modem within thirty (30) days or Subscriber will be charged an equipment fee equal to the fee charged by Spectrum at the time the voice modem was supplied by Spectrum.
An exception to this return policy is when the modem is also supporting Internet service, in which case Subscriber may continue to use the modem until such time as Internet is no longer provided or Spectrum requests a substitution of the modem.
Equipment and facilities furnished by Spectrum to provide Voice Service (except for inside wiring and inside jacks) are the property of Spectrum.
Telephone numbers assigned to Subscriber by Spectrum are portable and transferable with Subscriber at the same location.
however, Subscriber has no property right in telephone number(s) or any other call number designations associated with the Voice Services, and Spectrum may change such numbers as deemed necessary.

Depending on the location and Subscriber's preference, Spectrum Voice Service may include one (1) basic directory listing in an alphabetical white pages directory, or other comparable online directory, containing an alphabetical list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of all telephone customers in a particular geographic area set by the publisher.
The alphabetical list of customer names is for the purpose of informing interested parties of the telephone number and address of listed customers, and special position or arrangement of names may be provided for an additional charge.
Listings shall conform to the publisher's practices with respect to published directories.
Spectrum limits the length of any listing in the directory by the use of abbreviations when, in Spectrum's opinion, the clarity of the listing or the identification of the customer is not impaired by doing so.
The duration of directory listings, when the listings have been published, is the directory period.
The directory period is from the day on which the directory is first distributed to customers to the day the succeeding directory is first distributed to customers.
Spectrum's liability for directory listing errors or omissions is set out in Section 7, "Limitation of Liability." 7.

4.
Spectrum Mobile Service Functionality: The Device uses radio transmissions to access the Mobile Service.
If Subscriber's Device is not in range of a transmission signal the Mobile Service may not work.
The availability and quality of Mobile Service may be affected by many things, including the Mobile Service plan purchased, the Device, the operator of the mobile network, Subscriber's monthly usage, network capacity, network or Internet congestion, server speeds of websites, network outages, network management policies, terrain, buildings, foliage, weather, actions of third parties, or other similar issues, and Spectrum does not guarantee the availability of the mobile network or the service speeds.
Additionally, in some cases, Spectrum may reduce Subscriber download or streaming speeds, video resolution, or use of Spectrum's Mobile Hotspot Service after the Subscriber attains certain download levels or amounts, in accordance with the terms of Subscriber's Mobile Service plan (as described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Accordingly, actual speeds of the Mobile Service will vary.
Mobile Service that relies on location information, such as Enhanced 911 ("E-911"), which can provide the 911 operator with a person's location, and Global Positioning Satellite ("GPS") navigation, depend on a Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.
Subscriber may be unable to use his or her Device in any manner, including to call 911, while the Device is receiving a software update until the software update is complete.
Subscriber's Device may automatically connect to WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or other available Spectrum or third party WiFi hotspots.
When Subscriber's Device is connected to WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or any other WiFi hotspot that connects to Spectrum Internet, such Device is accessing Spectrum Internet and is not utilizing Spectrum Mobile Service and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Spectrum Internet Agreement.
Connection of a Device to WiFi hotspots is not subject to the usage policies, including any reductions in transmission speed, applicable to Spectrum Mobile Service and described in our Spectrum Mobile Service broadband disclosures www.spectrum.com/policies/mobile-broadband-disclosures.
Speed limitations on the use of Spectrum WiFi hotspots may apply to Spectrum Mobile customers who discontinue Spectrum Internet Service.
More detail on the terms and conditions of Spectrum Internet Service is set forth in the Spectrum Internet Agreement www.spectrum.com/policies/residential-terms.
Subscriber's connection to WiFi may be affected by a variety of factors, including the Device, interference (from other devices, buildings, or other wireless signals), or distance from WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in Subscriber's home or at another location.
Disabling the automatic WiFi connection feature may limit the availability of certain Spectrum Mobile Service features and/or reduce your utilization of Spectrum Internet, which provides you with unlimited access to data, thereby increasing your monthly Spectrum Mobile Service data usage.
Depending upon your Mobile Service plan, increased Spectrum Mobile Service data usage may increase your monthly charges or, if, you have subscribed to an Unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service Plan, increased data usage may impact your performance after you attain certain download levels or amounts.
For more information about your Mobile Service Plan, see www.spectrummobile.com/plans.

8.
Using Spectrum Mobile Service: The mobile network on which Spectrum provides the Mobile Service is a shared resource that is managed for the benefit of all its users and is a separate network from the network on which Spectrum provides Spectrum Internet.
Certain activities and uses of Spectrum's Mobile Service and uses of the network by an individual customer or small group of customers can negatively affect the use and enjoyment of the network by others.
Therefore, certain activities and uses of the Mobile Service are permitted and others are not.

or (n) connects a Device to a separate computing device (such as a computer, Smartphone, eBook or eReader, media player, laptop, or other devices with similar functions) through use of connection kits, applications, devices or accessories (using wired or wireless technology) unless Subscriber is using Spectrum's Mobile Hotspot Service.
The Mobile Service may be used only for lawful purposes.
Subscriber will not use or allow others to use the Mobile Service in any manner that is in violation of any applicable federal, state, local or international laws or regulations or to promote, engage in, or enable illegal activity or conduct that violates or infringes upon the rights of any person.
Transmission or distribution of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited.
This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, illegal, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.
Spectrum may block calls or data transmissions that are made to, or received from, certain countries, cities or telephone exchanges, or that use certain authorization codes if, in its sole discretion, Spectrum deems it reasonably necessary to prevent non-standard, excessive, unlawful or fraudulent use of the Mobile Service.
Furthermore, use of the Mobile Service to impersonate a person or entity or to engage in fraudulent activities is not permitted.
SPECTRUM RESERVES THE RIGHT AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR RESTRICT USE OF MOBILE SERVICE WITHOUT NOTICE IF SUCH USE VIOLATES THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.
9.
Roaming Charges: Roaming means coverage on another mobile network operator's network ("Roaming").
Subscriber's Mobile Service may be used for international calling and Roaming.
Mobile Service originated or received while outside a Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area is subject to Roaming charges.
Whether a Device can roam depends on Subscriber's Device, the Mobile Service plan, and the availability of Roaming coverage.
Certain Mobile Service may not be available or work the same when Roaming (for example, data services, voicemail, or call waiting).
Use of the Mobile Service while Roaming is also dependent on the Roaming provider's support of applicable network technology and functionality.
There may be higher rates and extra charges (including charges for long distance, tolls, or calls that do not connect) for international calling or when Roaming.
Subscriber may or may not be informed that he or she is Roaming, or of the associated costs.
Roaming may be limited or not available if more than half of Subscriber's monthly Mobile Service usage during a consecutive sixty (60) day period is outside the Subscriber's Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area (as described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Additionally, Spectrum may block the use of voice, text, and/or data service while Roaming within certain countries as Spectrum deems reasonably necessary to prevent non-standard, excessive, unlawful or fraudulent use of Mobile Service.
10.
Lost or Stolen Device: Subscriber agrees to call Spectrum immediately if his or her Device is lost or stolen so that the Mobile Service can be suspended to keep someone else from using it.
If Subscriber's Device is used after the loss or theft but before Subscriber reports it, and Subscriber wants a credit for any charges for that usage, Spectrum will review the account activity and any other information that Subscriber would like Spectrum to consider to show that the charges were not authorized.
Subscriber may be asked to provide or submit information to support the claim.
Spectrum may add the Device to the national "lost and stolen list," to prevent the Device from being used on any mobile network operator's network.
Subscriber may be held responsible for the charges if he or she delays reporting the loss or theft without good reason, but Subscriber does not have to pay any Mobile Service charges Subscriber disputes while they are being investigated.
A lost or stolen Device does not release Subscriber from their payment obligation under any Device Payment Plan or Lease Plan.
California Subscribers Only: Although Subscriber is not liable for charges Subscriber did not authorize, Spectrum considers the fact that a call was placed from Subscriber's Device as evidence that the call was authorized.
Unauthorized charges may include calls made to or from Subscriber's Device after it was lost or stolen.
If Subscriber does not report the loss or theft promptly, Subscriber may be responsible for the Mobile Service used until the incident is reported.
Once reported to Spectrum that the Device is lost or stolen and the Device is suspended, Subscriber will not be responsible for subsequent charges incurred by that Device.
If Spectrum has not given Subscriber a courtesy suspension of any recurring monthly charges during the past year, Spectrum will give Subscriber one (1) such suspension for thirty (30) days or until Subscriber replaces or recovers the Device, whichever comes first.
11.
Privacy &amp.
Information on a Device: As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may collect technical and service information from all Spectrum Mobile Service users during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service or from Subscriber's Device.
Such information may include Mobile Service plan and feature information, application download and usage information, Device or equipment information, network traffic or performance information, Mobile Service usage information, diagnostic data (including Device performance, signal strength, dropped call, data failure or battery strength information), and Location Information (defined below).
Spectrum may use such technical and service information to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
A Device can contain sensitive, personal information.
Spectrum is not responsible for any information stored on a Device, including sensitive or personal information.
Spectrum recommends that Subscriber safeguard any sensitive or personal information when the Device is out of Subscriber's possession or control.
By submitting a Device to Spectrum, Subscriber agrees that Spectrum employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on a Device.
If Subscriber exchanges, returns, or recycles a Device through Spectrum, Subscriber must remove all data and information from the Device before Subscriber provides it to Spectrum.
12.
Monthly Service Fee: Subscriber agrees to pay the monthly service charge for Spectrum Mobile Service which is comprised of various fees, taxes, and governmental or regulatory surcharges, such as federal or state universal service fund surcharges.
Spectrum reserves the right to increase or decrease any fee for Mobile Service offered.
Spectrum Mobile Service shall be terminated in the event Subscriber does not pay.
Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in Subscriber's Mobile Service plan (described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and Internet access.
Spectrum may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, Device, Lease Plan, installment plan charges, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Subscriber's Mobile Service.
Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, or handset upgrades).
Spectrum will notify Subscriber if any of these fees apply to the requested transaction.
To determine Subscriber's primary place of use ("PPU"), and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, Subscriber is required to provide Spectrum with Subscriber's residential street address.
If Subscriber does not provide Spectrum with such address, or if it falls outside of Spectrum's Coverage Area, Spectrum may reasonably designate a PPU within the Coverage Area for Subscriber.
Subscriber must live and have a mailing address within Spectrum's Coverage Area.
If Subscriber intends to use a Device at an alternate address, Subscriber must update the PPU for Subscriber's account by contacting Spectrum at (833) 224-6603.
13.
Billing: Subscriber will be billed on a monthly basis, in advance, for recurring Mobile Service and Device charges (e.g., line of service fees and/or associated taxes, service plan fees, features, prepaid usage, Spectrum Mobile Device Payment Plan, Lease Plan and any Device Protection Plan purchased), and in arrears for usage charges (e.g., data, international calling, and Roaming).
Charges for Roaming and international data may not appear on a billing statement during the bill cycle when the calls and/or data usage were incurred due to delays in receiving and reviewing such records.
If Subscriber receives Mobile Service or a Device under a promotion, after the promotional period ends the then-current market prices for Subscriber's Mobile Service or Device will apply.
For charges based on the amount of time used or for data sent or received, Spectrum will round up any fraction to the next full minute or, depending on how Subscriber is billed for data usage, the next full megabyte ("MB") or gigabyte ("GB").
For outgoing calls, usage time starts when Subscriber first presses 'SEND' (or similar key) or the call connects to a network.
and for incoming calls, it starts when the call connects to a network (which may be before it rings).
Usage time may end several seconds after Subscriber presses 'END' (or similar key) or after the call disconnects.
For calls made on the network, Spectrum will charge only for calls that are answered, including by machines.
Usage cannot always be processed right away and may be included in a later bill.
Subscribers with an unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service plan will pay a monthly charge for the Service in accordance with the terms of such plan.
For Subscribers with a Spectrum Mobile Service plan based on the amount of time used and/or data sent or received, Subscriber will be charged for all data sent, received, consumed by and/or used on Subscriber's account, including, without limitation, data consumed by applications (including any Spectrum Mobile Service and/or other Spectrum applications), widgets, multi-media messaging, tethering, uploading, downloading, streaming Content, Internet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications), GPS and location services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with Content sent or received).
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with a single line receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis will be rounded up to the next MB or GB, depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service plan.
For example, if Subscriber uses 1.2 GBs of data during a bill cycle, Subscriber will be billed for 2 GBs of usage.
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with multiple lines receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis may be aggregated and then rounded up to the next GB, depending on the terms of your Mobile Service plan.
If Subscriber selects a Mobile Service plan under a promotion that includes a predetermined allotment of Mobile Service (for example, a predetermined about of gigabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as part of such Mobile Service plan, any unused allotment of Mobile Service from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle.
Subscriber's first billing cycle will begin upon the earlier of Device activation or seven (7) days after the Device's shipment date, and Subscriber's first invoice may include partial-month charges for Service in addition to the charges above.
All Spectrum Mobile Service bills will be available via the MyAccount web portal and application.
Subscriber will be billed separately for Spectrum Mobile Service from any other Spectrum services, including Spectrum Internet or Spectrum TV.
14.
Unauthorized Charges: SUBSCRIBER SHOULD USE CARE WHEN ALLOWING ANOTHER PERSON, INCLUDING A CHILD OR OTHER MINOR, TO USE A DEVICE ON SUBSCRIBER'S ACCOUNT.
Subscriber is obligated to pay all charges incurred, including charges from any other user of a Device associated with Subscriber's account.
Many services and applications are accessible on or through a Device, including purchases of games, movies, music, and other Content.
Some of these services are provided by Spectrum.
Others are provided by third parties that may offer the option to bill charges to Subscriber's Spectrum bill or other methods of payment.
Charges may be one-time or recurring.
If the purchaser is permitted to have charges billed to Subscriber's account and so chooses, such charges will become part of the amount due for that billing cycle.
Subscriber is solely responsible for all charges to such third parties, including all applicable taxes.
In addition, Subscriber is solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.
Spectrum may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party.
Spectrum will not be responsible for any dispute regarding charges between Subscriber and any third party.
Subscriber must address all such disputes directly with the third party.
15.
Spectrum's Right to Limit or End Mobile Service or this Agreement: Spectrum can, without notice, limit, suspend or end Subscriber's Mobile Service or any agreement with Subscriber for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if Subscriber: (a) breaches this Agreement.
(b) resells his or her Mobile Service.
(c) uses the Mobile Service for any illegal or fraudulent purpose.
(d) installs, deploys, or uses any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate a radio frequency signal without Spectrum's permission.
(e) steals from or lies to Spectrum.
(f) fails to pay his or her bill on time for any Spectrum service.
(g) incurs charges larger than a required Deposit or billing limit, or materially in excess of his or her monthly access charges (even if Spectrum hasn't yet billed the charges).
or (h) is unable to pay Spectrum or goes bankrupt.
or (2) if Subscriber or any user of Subscriber's Device, or any line of Mobile Service on Subscriber's account: (a) threatens, harasses, or uses vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward Spectrum's representatives.
(b) interferes with Spectrum's operations.
(c) "spams" or engages in other abusive messaging or calling.
(d) modifies his or her Device from its manufacturer's specifications.
or (e) uses Subscriber's Mobile Service in a way that negatively affects the network or other customers or that violates the restrictions in Section 8, above.
Spectrum can also temporarily limit Subscriber's Mobile Service for any operational or governmental reason.
Spectrum's rights under this section are in addition to any specific rights that Spectrum reserves in other provisions of this Agreement or in other Terms of Service to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service and to terminate Subscriber's Agreement.
16.
Porting: Subscriber may be able to transfer, or "port," his or her mobile phone number to another mobile network operator.
If Subscriber ports a number from Spectrum, Spectrum will treat it as though Subscriber requested Spectrum to cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service for that number.
After the porting is completed, Subscriber will not be able to use Spectrum's Mobile Service for that number, but Subscriber will remain responsible for all Mobile Service fees and charges incurred through the end of that billing cycle, and any Device charges, just like any other cancellation.
If Subscriber ports a number to Spectrum, Spectrum may not be able to provide some services right away, such as E-911 services.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that except as required by applicable law, Subscriber does not have any proprietary rights to the mobile number assigned by Spectrum, except for any right Subscriber may have to port it.
17.
Location Information: Subscriber's Device or Spectrum's Mobile Service can determine the physical geographical location of the Device and Subscriber ("Location Information").
As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may automatically collect Location Information or other customer data during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service.
Together, Spectrum, its partners, and/or the network service provider may use Location Information, as well as customer data, usage and performance information obtained from the network or Subscriber's Device, to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
Location Information may also be used to create aggregate data from which Subscriber's personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured.
Such aggregate data may be used for a variety of purposes (e.g., scientific and marketing research, vehicle traffic volume and monitoring).
It is Subscriber's responsibility to notify users on Subscriber's account that such information may be collected by such users' use of the Mobile Service or from Devices linked to Subscriber's account.
Subscriber's Device is also capable of using optional Content at Subscriber's request or the request of a user on Subscriber's account, offered by Spectrum or third parties that make use of a Device's Location Information ("Location-Based Service").
Subscriber should review the terms and conditions and the associated privacy policy for each Location-Based Service to learn how the location information will be used and protected.
If Subscriber does not want the Location-Based Service to collect or use Location Information, Subscriber should disable location services on the Device using the Device settings.
18.
911 and Emergency Alerts: When making calls to a public-safety answering point ("PSAP") from a Device, such as dialing 911, Subscriber should always be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number.
Unlike calls from a traditional wireline phone, a PSAP may not know the emergency caller's location or phone number.
Although some local emergency authorities have enabled E-911 services that use GPS or other methods to determine callers' locations, E-911 does not always provide accurate location information.
If Subscriber's Device is indoors, cannot acquire a satellite signal, or otherwise cannot obtain the caller's location, the Location Information may not be automatically delivered to the PSAP.
Also the process of porting a phone number may limit the Mobile Service from being able to provide location services to the PSAP during that time.
If Subscriber makes a 911 call, the 911 operator may see a phone number that is different from Subscriber's personal phone number.
There may be instances when the PSAP might not be able to call Subscriber back.
Calls to 911 over WiFi or a data connection may operate differently than traditional wireline calls to 911.
Such calls may not connect to the PSAP, may be limited, or may be unavailable if Subscriber is experiencing a power outage, if there is a disruption in WiFi service or to the data connection, or if Subscriber is unable to access the Internet.
If Subscriber's call connects to a PSAP, his or her Location Information and phone number may not be transmitted.
Additionally, if Subscriber has not updated his or her emergency 911 address in the settings of their Device, their Device may provide a PSAP with Location Information that is different from Subscriber's calling location.
Subscriber should be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number to the PSAP.
If Subscriber is deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled and needs to reach emergency services, Subscriber should call 911 directly using TTY or a telecommunications relay service.
Spectrum may also provide wireless emergency alerts within portions of its Coverage Area on wireless emergency alert capable devices.
There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.
Wireless emergency alerts may not be available on all Devices or in the entire Coverage Area, or if Subscriber is outside of the Coverage Area.
In areas in which the emergency alerts are transmitted, such alerts may not be received by a Subscriber or user of Spectrum's Mobile Service even though the user has a Device capable of receiving them.

4.
Spectrum Mobile Service Functionality: The Device uses radio transmissions to access the Mobile Service.
If Subscriber's Device is not in range of a transmission signal the Mobile Service may not work.
The availability and quality of Mobile Service may be affected by many things, including the Mobile Service plan purchased, the Device, the operator of the mobile network, Subscriber's monthly usage, network capacity, network or Internet congestion, server speeds of websites, network outages, network management policies, terrain, buildings, foliage, weather, actions of third parties, or other similar issues, and Spectrum does not guarantee the availability of the mobile network or the service speeds.
Additionally, under certain circumstances, Spectrum may reduce Subscriber download or streaming speeds, video resolution, or use of Spectrum's Mobile Hotspot Service, including after the Subscriber attains certain download levels or amounts, in accordance with the terms of Subscriber's Mobile Service plan (as described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Accordingly, actual speeds of the Mobile Service will vary.
Mobile Service that relies on location information, such as Enhanced 911 ("E-911"), which can provide the 911 operator with a person's location, and Global Positioning Satellite ("GPS") navigation, depend on a Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.
Subscriber may be unable to use his or her Device in any manner, including to call 911, while the Device is receiving a software update until the software update is complete.
Subscriber's Device may automatically connect to WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or other available Spectrum or third party WiFi hotspots.
When Subscriber's Device is connected to WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in your home that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or any other WiFi hotspot that connects to Spectrum Internet, such Device is accessing Spectrum Internet and is not utilizing Spectrum Mobile Service and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Spectrum Internet Agreement.
Connection of a Device to WiFi hotspots is not subject to the usage policies, including any reductions in transmission speed, applicable to Spectrum Mobile Service and described in our Spectrum Mobile Service broadband disclosures www.spectrum.com/policies/mobile-broadband-disclosures.
Speed limitations on the use of Spectrum WiFi hotspots may apply to Spectrum Mobile customers who discontinue Spectrum Internet Service.
More detail on the terms and conditions of Spectrum Internet Service is set forth in the Spectrum Internet Agreement www.spectrum.com/policies/residential-terms.
Subscriber's connection to WiFi may be affected by a variety of factors, including the Device, interference (from other devices, buildings, or other wireless signals), or distance from WiFi hotspots, including the WiFi network in Subscriber's home or at another location.
Disabling the automatic WiFi connection feature may limit the availability of certain Spectrum Mobile Service features and/or reduce your utilization of Spectrum Internet, which provides you with unlimited access to data, thereby increasing your monthly Spectrum Mobile Service data usage.
Depending upon your Mobile Service plan, increased Spectrum Mobile Service data usage may increase your monthly charges or, if, you have subscribed to an Unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service Plan, increased data usage may impact your performance after you attain certain download levels or amounts.
For more information about your Mobile Service Plan, see www.spectrummobile.com/plans.
5.

Content from third parties or applications that Subscriber downloads or activates (e.g., Visual Voicemail) may also be subject to additional terms of service.
Policies regarding intellectual property, privacy and other terms of use may differ from these Terms of Service, and Subscriber may be bound by such policies or terms when Subscriber visits third party sites, downloads or uses third party services, or downloads or activates applications.
Access or use of applications or Content may increase your monthly Spectrum Mobile Service data usage, and depending upon your Mobile Service plan, increased Spectrum Mobile Service data usage may increase your monthly fees or, if you have subscribed to an Unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service Plan, increased data usage may impact your performance after you attain certain download levels or amounts.
It is Subscriber's responsibility to read the rules or service agreements with each Content provider or service provider, or for each application.
Any information Subscriber involuntarily or voluntarily provides to third parties is governed by their policies or terms.
SPECTRUM IS NOT A PUBLISHER OF THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION, APPLICATIONS OR OTHER CONTENT AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OPINIONS, ADVICE, STATEMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION, SERVICES OR GOODS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES.

Furthermore, use of the Mobile Service to impersonate a person or entity or to engage in fraudulent activities is not permitted.
SPECTRUM RESERVES THE RIGHT AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR RESTRICT USE OF MOBILE SERVICE WITHOUT NOTICE IF SUCH USE VIOLATES THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.
9.
Roaming and International Charges: Roaming means coverage on another mobile network operator's network ("Roaming").
Subscriber's Mobile Service may be used for international calling and Roaming.
Mobile Service originated or received while outside a Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area is subject to Roaming charges.
Whether a Device can roam depends on Subscriber's Device, the Mobile Service plan, and the availability of Roaming coverage.
Certain Mobile Service may not be available or work the same when Roaming (for example, data services, voicemail, or call waiting).
Use of the Mobile Service while Roaming is also dependent on the Roaming provider's support of applicable network technology and functionality.
There may be higher rates and extra charges (including charges for long distance, tolls, or calls that do not connect) for international calling or when Roaming.
Subscriber may or may not be informed that he or she is Roaming, or of the associated costs.
Roaming may be limited or not available if more than half of Subscriber's monthly Mobile Service usage during a consecutive sixty (60) day period is outside the Subscriber's Mobile Service plan's included Coverage Area (as described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Additionally, Spectrum may block the use of voice, text, and/or data service while Roaming within certain countries as Spectrum deems reasonably necessary to prevent non-standard, excessive, unlawful or fraudulent use of Mobile Service.
Spectrum Mobile Service includes up to 2,000 minutes per line of combined monthly calling to Canada and Mexico, subject to acceptable use limitations (described below).
Calling to Canada or Mexico during a bill cycle that exceeds such limit or violates the acceptable use limitations may be subject to a $0.02 per minute charge.
Additionally, Spectrum Mobile may limit all international service, suspend service, or charge $0.02 per minute for all calling to Canada or Mexico, if Subscriber violates the following acceptable use limitations in two consecutive bill cycles.
The Canada and Mexico calling plan is for use by Subscriber for non-commercial voice or live dialog only, and acceptable use of the plan excludes (i) use for commercial purposes, including, but not limited to, telemarketing, call center services, medical transcription, facsimile or voice message broadcasting, or use by a home-based, non-profit, or governmental business or enterprise, (ii) use with auto-dialers or predictive dialers, or for resale of service, (iii) use by persons or entities other than Subscriber, or (iv) any non-standard or excessive use, unusual call patterns, lack of continuous dialog activity, or unlawful or fraudulent use, as determined by Spectrum Mobile.
10.
Lost or Stolen Device: Subscriber agrees to call Spectrum immediately if his or her Device is lost or stolen so that the Mobile Service can be suspended to keep someone else from using it.
If Subscriber's Device is used after the loss or theft but before Subscriber reports it, and Subscriber wants a credit for any charges for that usage, Spectrum will review the account activity and any other information that Subscriber would like Spectrum to consider to show that the charges were not authorized.
Subscriber may be asked to provide or submit information to support the claim.
Spectrum may add the Device to the national "lost and stolen list," to prevent the Device from being used on any mobile network operator's network.
Subscriber may be held responsible for the charges if he or she delays reporting the loss or theft without good reason, but Subscriber does not have to pay any Mobile Service charges Subscriber disputes while they are being investigated.
A lost or stolen Device does not release Subscriber from their payment obligation under any Device Payment Plan or Lease Plan.
California Subscribers Only: Although Subscriber is not liable for charges Subscriber did not authorize, Spectrum considers the fact that a call was placed from Subscriber's Device as evidence that the call was authorized.
Unauthorized charges may include calls made to or from Subscriber's Device after it was lost or stolen.
If Subscriber does not report the loss or theft promptly, Subscriber may be responsible for the Mobile Service used until the incident is reported.
Once reported to Spectrum that the Device is lost or stolen and the Device is suspended, Subscriber will not be responsible for subsequent charges incurred by that Device.
If Spectrum has not given Subscriber a courtesy suspension of any recurring monthly charges during the past year, Spectrum will give Subscriber one (1) such suspension for thirty (30) days or until Subscriber replaces or recovers the Device, whichever comes first.
11.
Privacy &amp.
Information on a Device: As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may collect technical and service information from all Spectrum Mobile Service users during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service or from Subscriber's Device.
Such information may include Mobile Service plan and feature information, application download and usage information, Device or equipment information, network traffic or performance information, Mobile Service usage information, diagnostic data (including Device performance, signal strength, dropped call, data failure or battery strength information), and Location Information (defined below).
Spectrum may use such technical and service information to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
A Device can contain sensitive, personal information.
Spectrum is not responsible for any information stored on a Device, including sensitive or personal information.
Spectrum recommends that Subscriber safeguard any sensitive or personal information when the Device is out of Subscriber's possession or control.
By submitting a Device to Spectrum, Subscriber agrees that Spectrum employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on a Device.
If Subscriber exchanges, returns, or recycles a Device through Spectrum, Subscriber must remove all data and information from the Device before Subscriber provides it to Spectrum.
12.
Monthly Service Fee: Subscriber agrees to pay the monthly service fee for Spectrum Mobile Service.
Applicable taxes and regulatory fees attributable to Spectrum Mobile Service are included in the recurring monthly service fee.
Applicable taxes on equipment sales and one-time charges, described below, are billed separately from the monthly service fee.
Spectrum reserves the right to increase or decrease any fee or charge associated with Spectrum Mobile Service.
Spectrum Mobile Service shall be terminated in the event Subscriber does not pay.
Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in Subscriber's Mobile Service plan (described at www.spectrummobile.com/plans).
Depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and Internet access.
Spectrum may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, Device, Lease Plan, installment plan charges, or other charges to establish, change, or maintain Subscriber's Mobile Service.
Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, or handset upgrades).
Spectrum will notify Subscriber if any of these charges apply to the requested transaction.
To determine Subscriber's primary place of use ("PPU"), and which jurisdiction's taxes and assessments to collect, Subscriber is required to provide Spectrum with Subscriber's residential street address.
If Subscriber does not provide Spectrum with such address, or if it falls outside of Spectrum's Coverage Area, Spectrum may reasonably designate a PPU within the Coverage Area for Subscriber.
Subscriber must live and have a mailing address within Spectrum's Coverage Area.
If Subscriber intends to use a Device at an alternate address, Subscriber must update the PPU for Subscriber's account by contacting Spectrum at (833) 224-6603.
13.
Billing: Subscriber will be billed on a monthly basis, in advance, for recurring Mobile Service and Device charges (e.g., service plan fees, features, prepaid usage, Spectrum Mobile Device Payment Plan, Lease Plan and any Device Protection Plan purchased), and in arrears for usage charges (e.g., data, international calling, and Roaming).
Charges for Roaming and international data may not appear on a billing statement during the bill cycle when the calls and/or data usage were incurred due to delays in receiving and reviewing such records.
If Subscriber receives Mobile Service or a Device under a promotion, after the promotional period ends the then-current market prices for Subscriber's Mobile Service or Device will apply.
For charges based on the amount of time used or for data sent or received, Spectrum will round up any fraction to the next full minute or, depending on how Subscriber is billed for data usage, the next full gigabyte ("GB").
For outgoing calls, usage time starts when Subscriber first presses 'SEND' (or similar key) or the call connects to a network.
and for incoming calls, it starts when the call connects to a network (which may be before it rings).
Usage time may end several seconds after Subscriber presses 'END' (or similar key) or after the call disconnects.
For calls made on the network, Spectrum will charge only for calls that are answered, including by machines.
Usage cannot always be processed right away and may be included in a later bill.
Subscribers with an unlimited Spectrum Mobile Service plan will pay a monthly fee for the Service in accordance with the terms of such plan.
For Subscribers with a Spectrum Mobile Service plan based on the amount of time used and/or data sent or received, Subscriber will be charged for all data sent, received, consumed by and/or used on Subscriber's account, including, without limitation, data consumed by applications (including any Spectrum Mobile Service and/or other Spectrum applications), widgets, multi-media messaging, tethering, uploading, downloading, streaming Content, Internet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications), GPS and location services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with Content sent or received).
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with a single line receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis will be rounded up to the next GB, depending on Subscriber's Mobile Service plan.
For example, if Subscriber uses 1.2 GBs of data during a bill cycle, Subscriber will be billed for 2 GBs of usage.
At the end of each bill cycle, data usage for an account with multiple lines receiving Mobile Service on a pay-as-you-go basis will be aggregated and then rounded up to the next GB, depending on the terms of your Mobile Service plan.
If Subscriber selects a Mobile Service plan under a promotion that includes a predetermined allotment of Mobile Service (for example, a predetermined amount of gigabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as part of such Mobile Service plan, any unused allotment of Mobile Service from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle.
Subscriber's first billing cycle will begin upon the earlier of Device activation or seven (7) days after the Device's shipment date, and Subscriber's first invoice may include partial-month charges for Service in addition to the charges above.
All Spectrum Mobile Service bills will be available via the MyAccount web portal and application.
Subscriber will be billed separately for Spectrum Mobile Service from any other Spectrum services, including Spectrum Internet or Spectrum TV.
14.
Unauthorized Charges: SUBSCRIBER SHOULD USE CARE WHEN ALLOWING ANOTHER PERSON, INCLUDING A CHILD OR OTHER MINOR, TO USE A DEVICE ON SUBSCRIBER'S ACCOUNT.
Subscriber is obligated to pay all charges incurred, including charges from any other user of a Device associated with Subscriber's account.
Many services and applications are accessible on or through a Device, including purchases of games, movies, music, and other Content.
Some of these services are provided by Spectrum.
Others are provided by third parties that may offer the option to bill charges to Subscriber's Spectrum bill or other methods of payment.
Charges may be one-time or recurring.
If the purchaser is permitted to have charges billed to Subscriber's account and so chooses, such charges will become part of the amount due for that billing cycle.
Subscriber is solely responsible for all charges to such third parties, including all applicable taxes.
In addition, Subscriber is solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.
Spectrum may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party.
Spectrum will not be responsible for any dispute regarding charges between Subscriber and any third party.
Subscriber must address all such disputes directly with the third party.
15.
Spectrum's Right to Limit or End Mobile Service or this Agreement: Spectrum can, without notice, limit, suspend or end Subscriber's Mobile Service or any agreement with Subscriber for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if Subscriber: (a) breaches this Agreement.
(b) resells his or her Mobile Service.
(c) uses the Mobile Service for any illegal or fraudulent purpose or in violation of any acceptable use requirements.
(d) installs, deploys, or uses any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate a radio frequency signal without Spectrum's permission.
(e) steals from or lies to Spectrum.
(f) fails to pay his or her bill on time for any Spectrum service.
(g) incurs charges larger than a required Deposit or billing limit, or materially in excess of his or her monthly access charges (even if Spectrum hasn't yet billed the charges).
or (h) is unable to pay Spectrum or goes bankrupt.
or (2) if Subscriber or any user of Subscriber's Device, or any line of Mobile Service on Subscriber's account: (a) threatens, harasses, or uses vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward Spectrum's representatives.
(b) interferes with Spectrum's operations.
(c) "spams" or engages in other abusive messaging or calling.
(d) modifies his or her Device from its manufacturer's specifications.
or (e) uses Subscriber's Mobile Service in a way that negatively affects the network or other customers or that violates the restrictions in Section 8, above.
Spectrum can also temporarily limit Subscriber's Mobile Service for any operational or governmental reason.
Spectrum's rights under this section are in addition to any specific rights that Spectrum reserves in other provisions of this Agreement or in other Terms of Service to interrupt, suspend, modify, or cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service and to terminate Subscriber's Agreement.
16.
Porting: Subscriber may be able to transfer, or "port," his or her mobile phone number to another mobile network operator.
If Subscriber ports a number from Spectrum, Spectrum will treat it as though Subscriber requested Spectrum to cancel Subscriber's Mobile Service for that number.
After the porting is completed, Subscriber will not be able to use Spectrum's Mobile Service for that number, but Subscriber will remain responsible for all Mobile Service fees and charges incurred through the end of that billing cycle, and any Device charges, just like any other cancellation.
If Subscriber ports a number to Spectrum, Spectrum may not be able to provide some services right away, such as E-911 services.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that except as required by applicable law, Subscriber does not have any proprietary rights to the mobile number assigned by Spectrum, except for any right Subscriber may have to port it.
17.
Location Information: Subscriber's Device or Spectrum's Mobile Service can determine the physical geographical location of the Device and Subscriber ("Location Information").
As described in the Spectrum Privacy Policy, Spectrum, along with its partners, may automatically collect Location Information or other customer data during Spectrum's provision of Mobile Service.
Together, Spectrum, its partners, and/or the network service provider may use Location Information, as well as customer data, usage and performance information obtained from the network or Subscriber's Device, to provide mobile voice and data services, and to improve Subscriber's network experience and the quality of Subscriber's mobile experience.
Location Information may also be used to create aggregate data from which Subscriber's personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured.
Such aggregate data may be used for a variety of purposes (e.g., scientific and marketing research, vehicle traffic volume and monitoring).
It is Subscriber's responsibility to notify users on Subscriber's account that such information may be collected by such users' use of the Mobile Service or from Devices linked to Subscriber's account.
Subscriber's Device is also capable of using optional Content at Subscriber's request or the request of a user on Subscriber's account, offered by Spectrum or third parties that make use of a Device's Location Information ("Location-Based Service").
Subscriber should review the terms and conditions and the associated privacy policy for each Location-Based Service to learn how the location information will be used and protected.
If Subscriber does not want the Location-Based Service to collect or use Location Information, Subscriber should disable location services on the Device using the Device settings.
18.
911 and Emergency Alerts: When making calls to a public-safety answering point ("PSAP") from a Device, such as dialing 911, Subscriber should always be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number.
Unlike calls from a traditional wireline phone, a PSAP may not know the emergency caller's location or phone number.
Although some local emergency authorities have enabled E-911 services that use GPS or other methods to determine callers' locations, E-911 does not always provide accurate location information.
If Subscriber's Device is indoors, cannot acquire a satellite signal, or otherwise cannot obtain the caller's location, the Location Information may not be automatically delivered to the PSAP.
Also the process of porting a phone number may limit the Mobile Service from being able to provide location services to the PSAP during that time.
If Subscriber makes a 911 call, the 911 operator may see a phone number that is different from Subscriber's personal phone number.
There may be instances when the PSAP might not be able to call Subscriber back.
Calls to 911 over WiFi or a data connection may operate differently than traditional wireline calls to 911.
Such calls may not connect to the PSAP, may be limited, or may be unavailable if Subscriber is experiencing a power outage, if there is a disruption in WiFi service or to the data connection, or if Subscriber is unable to access the Internet.
If Subscriber's call connects to a PSAP, his or her Location Information and phone number may not be transmitted.
Additionally, if Subscriber has not updated his or her emergency 911 address in the settings of their Device, their Device may provide a PSAP with Location Information that is different from Subscriber's calling location.
Subscriber should be prepared to provide his or her location and phone number to the PSAP.
If Subscriber is deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled and needs to reach emergency services, Subscriber should call 911 directly using TTY or a telecommunications relay service.
Spectrum may also provide wireless emergency alerts within portions of its Coverage Area on wireless emergency alert capable devices.
There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.
Wireless emergency alerts may not be available on all Devices or in the entire Coverage Area, or if Subscriber is outside of the Coverage Area.
In areas in which the emergency alerts are transmitted, such alerts may not be received by a Subscriber or user of Spectrum's Mobile Service even though the user has a Device capable of receiving them.

<p>Spectrum Mobile Service Broadband Disclosures</p> Charter's Spectrum Mobile and Spectrum Business Mobile broadband Internet access services ("Spectrum Mobile Service," "Service" or "Spectrum") utilize our mobile network partner(s)' ("MNP") mobile broadband Internet access service network and is subject to its network management practices and controls.
The disclosures below reflect, where appropriate, those practices and controls.
These disclosures do not describe the practices, characteristics, or terms that apply when our customers are roaming on mobile networks other than those of our MNP.
In order to purchase Spectrum Mobile Service, a subscriber must be an existing customer of Spectrum Internet or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet (as applicable), or subscriber must purchase such Internet service at the time of purchase of Spectrum Mobile Service.
As long as subscriber remains a customer of Spectrum Internet or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet (as applicable), subscriber will have access to Spectrum's WiFi hotspots.
Network Practices The bullets below provide an overview of the network practices applicable to Spectrum Mobile Service.
• Blocking Spectrum Mobile Service does not block or otherwise prevent end user access to lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
Spectrum Mobile Service does engage in reasonable network management practices described below.
• Throttling Spectrum Mobile Service does not degrade or impair access to lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of a non-harmful device.
Spectrum Mobile Service does engage in reasonable network management practices described below, including limiting video streaming to DVD quality (typically 480p) for customers using our MNP's network.
• Affiliated Prioritization Spectrum Mobile Service does not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, to benefit an affiliate.
• Paid Prioritization Spectrum Mobile Service does not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, in exchange for consideration, monetary or otherwise.
• Congestion Management Over Mobile Network.
Spectrum Mobile Service strives to provide Spectrum Mobile Service customers the best experience when they are using our MNP's network.
However, an individual user's experience will vary depending upon many factors, including the MNP network (3G Ev-DO or 4G LTE) the customer is using and the mobile device ("device") in use.
Our MNP uses optimization and transcoding technologies on both the 3G Ev-DO and 4G LTE networks to transmit data files in a more efficient manner to allow available network capacity to benefit the greatest number of users.
These techniques include caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing video files more appropriately for mobile devices.
These techniques are agnostic as to the content itself and to the website that provides it.
While these techniques seek to avoid changing text, image, and video files, and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible by the customer, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on a customer's mobile device.
Over WiFi.
When Spectrum Mobile Service customers are connected using WiFi, congestion management practices applicable to that connection will vary by Internet Service Provider ("ISP").
On Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home, Spectrum uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards.
Additional information on Spectrum's congestion management practices is available here.
Spectrum is not responsible for the congestion management techniques used by other ISPs for their WiFi networks.
If your device connects to another ISP's WiFi network, you should consult that provider's terms of service and broadband disclosures for information about their practices.
The optimization and transcoding techniques described above under Over Mobile Network are not applied when a device is utilizing Spectrum WiFi (and may not be utilized by other WiFi service providers) to transmit data, and therefore text, image, and video files will be delivered over WiFi at the native resolution.
Roaming.
For those geographic areas that are not served by our MNP's owned and operated mobile networks, our MNPs enter into agreements with other mobile network providers.
The use of customers' devices to access data over another provider's networks - both domestic and international - is called "roaming" usage.
Our ability to make Services available to customers on these other mobile networks is based on a variety of dynamic factors, including business considerations, the terms of the agreements our MNPs have at any given time with other mobile network providers, and the network technology, frequency(ies) and functionality of those networks.
Use of Spectrum Mobile Services when roaming is dependent upon the roaming provider's support of applicable network technology and functionality.
Check with roaming network providers individually for support and coverage details.
Devices can transmit and receive data messages without user intervention and can generate unexpected charges when powered "on" outside the United States, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands.
Certain countries and/or carriers within a roaming zone may be unavailable while roaming.
We do not guarantee the availability, quality of coverage or speed for roaming Services that are accessed using other mobile network provider networks and we may reduce speeds to 2G speeds or suspend the roaming Service available on these networks at any time without notice.
• Application-Specific Behavior You may access any lawful application for use on the Spectrum Mobile Service, subject to our Residential General Terms and Conditions of Service, Spectrum Business Services Agreement, Network Management Practices, Spectrum Residential Mobile Services Agreement, Spectrum Business Mobile Services Agreement, and Privacy Policy discussed in these disclosures.
Spectrum reserves the right at all times to intervene to protect the integrity of its services, including its Spectrum Mobile Service, and network.
While Spectrum does not favor certain websites or Internet applications by blocking, throttling, or modifying particular protocols, protocol ports, or protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standards, we may prevent the use of certain ports on our Spectrum WiFi service that are commonly used to spread malware and engage in other malicious activity.
• Device Attachment Rules You may activate devices that Charter has certified to be compatible with its network, including devices not purchased directly from Charter.
Information about obtaining a new mobile device, including a list of approved mobile devices and their prices, is available here.
Depending on the capability of your mobile device, using your Spectrum Mobile Service to create a mobile hotspot to connect to other devices is permitted pursuant to the terms, conditions, and data pricing options of your Spectrum Mobile Service (see Commercial Terms, below) and subject to the network management practices and controls of our MNP.
• Security Spectrum recognizes that a reliable network must be, among other things, a secure network.
We, along with our MNP, work to protect the network against outside attacks, tampering, malicious activity, and network events that may in any way disrupt or degrade Spectrum Mobile Service customers' ability to use the network.
Our MNP blocks a limited number of Internet addresses that are disruptive or malicious and typically persistent, based on analysis and third-party intelligence.
Our MNP does not block sites based on content or subject, unless the Internet address hosts unlawful content.
Our MNP regularly reviews and modifies the list of blocked Internet addresses, taking any off the list that are no longer perceived as a threat.
Performance Characteristics • Service Description Over Mobile Network.
Spectrum Mobile Service offers mobile broadband Internet access services to its customers over 3G Ev-DO and 4G LTE mobile broadband networks.
Based on our MNP's internal testing and testing commissioned from third-party vendors, Spectrum expects customers will experience the following speeds on the Spectrum Mobile Service: • 4G LTE network: typical download speeds of 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload speeds of 2-5 Mbps.
• 3G Ev-DO network: typical download speeds of 600 kilobits per second (Kbps)-1.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 500-800 Kbps for Ev-DO Rev.
A devices (if you are using an Ev-DO Rev.
0 device, typical download speeds are 400-700 Kbps and upload speeds are 60-80 Kbps).
DVD-Quality Video streaming is supported at 4G speeds (video typically streams at 480p).
With respect to latency for use of real-time data applications, our MNP expects network-to-mobile device (round-trip) latency to be less than 100 milliseconds (ms) on our MNP's 4G network and less than 240ms on its 3G Ev-DO network.
Latency is the time delay in transmitting or receiving packets on a network.
Latency is primarily a function of the distance between two points in transmission, but also can be affected by the number and quality of connections to the network or networks used in transmission.
Our MNP currently does not report packet loss data, and so Spectrum Mobile Service is not technically able to measure packet loss on the network.
Packet loss is the percentage of packets that are sent by the source but not received by the destination.
This is sometimes due to congestion along the route but may also reflect an impairment in the network.
You must be using a 4G LTE mobile device and be within our MNP's 4G LTE coverage area to access its 4G LTE network.
You must be using a 3G Ev-DO-capable mobile device and be within our MNP's 3G Ev-DO coverage area to access its 3G Ev-DO network.
For 4G and 3G coverage information, click here.
Customers with 4G LTE devices will access the 3G Ev-DO network where it is available outside the 4G LTE coverage area.
The actual speeds you experience on our MNP's network will depend on many factors, including, among others, the type of mobile device, the programs running on the mobile device, your location, and how many other customers are attempting to use the same spectrum resources (including both mobile broadband Internet access and other non-broadband Internet access services that share the network).
Over Spectrum WiFi.
The results above do not reflect the Spectrum Mobile Service experienced by customers connected to Spectrum WiFi hotspots outside the home (or the WiFi network in your home or office that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet Service).
Spectrum Mobile Service may automatically connect to Spectrum WiFi hotspots (or the WiFi network in your home or office that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet Service) when available unless the customer changes mobile device settings to inhibit such functionality.
Performance over any WiFi network, including Spectrum WiFi hotspots, may vary based on any number of factors, such as, but not limited to, the number of other subscribers trying to use the same WiFi router at the same time, your mobile device, your WiFi receiving antenna, your distance to the WiFi router, attenuation from walls and foliage, and interference from other mobile devices using the same spectrum.
WiFi uses spectrum that the FCC has allocated for "unlicensed" use, which means that use of this spectrum is not protected from interference from other mobile devices using the same spectrum in the same geographic area.
Therefore, Spectrum WiFi hotspots, as well as any WiFi connections through your home Spectrum Internet service or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet Service, is provided on a "best efforts" basis.
When not connected to Spectrum WiFi hotspots (or the WiFi network in your home of office that is connected to your Spectrum Internet Service or Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet Service), Spectrum Mobile Service will attempt to connect over our MNP's mobile broadband Internet access service network.
Additional information on Spectrum WiFi is available in our Network Management Practices as well as our Internet Acceptable Use Policy and Spectrum Business Internet Acceptable Use Policy, our Residential Internet Services Agreement and Spectrum Business High-Speed Internet Service Terms - each of which are incorporated into our Residential General Terms and Conditions of Service and our Spectrum Business Services Agreement, as applicable.
• Other Services on the Network Spectrum Mobile Service uses our MNP's mobile broadband Internet access service network and shares that network with those services and other non-broadband Internet access services that our MNP offers.
When accessing Spectrum Mobile Service via a Spectrum WiFi access point, broadband Internet access service and Voice over WiFi service will be delivered via the access point.
When accessing Spectrum Mobile Service via another WiFi network, users may share those WiFi networks with other services that Spectrum does not know about or manage.
As such, Spectrum Mobile Service cannot predict other services that may share the WiFi network.

4.
Funcionalidad del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum: El Dispositivo usa transmisiones de radio para acceder al Servicio Móvil.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado no está dentro del alcance de una señal de transmisión, es posible que el Servicio Móvil no funcione.
La disponibilidad y calidad del Servicio Móvil pueden verse afectadas por muchos factores, incluyendo el plan de Servicio Móvil adquirido, el Dispositivo, el operador de la red móvil, el uso mensual del Abonado, la capacidad de la red, la congestión de la red o Internet, las velocidades de los servidores de sitios web, las interrupciones de la red, las políticas de administración de la red, el terreno, los edificios, el follaje, el clima, las acciones de terceros u otros problemas similares, y Spectrum no garantiza la disponibilidad de la red móvil ni las velocidades del servicio.
Además, en algunos casos, Spectrum puede reducir las velocidades de descarga o reproducción, resolución de video o uso del servicio de hotspot móvil de Spectrum del Abonado después de que el Abonado alcanza ciertos niveles o cantidades de descargas, conforme a los términos del plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (según se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Por consiguiente, las velocidades reales del Servicio Móvil variarán.
El Servicio Móvil que depende de la información de ubicación, como 911 Mejorado (“E-911”), que puede proporcionar la ubicación de una persona al operador del 911, y la navegación del posicionamiento global por satélite (“GPS”) dependen de la capacidad de un Dispositivo para recibir señales satelitales (generalmente no disponible en ambientes interiores) y la cobertura de la red.
Es posible que el Abonado no pueda usar su Dispositivo de ninguna manera, incluyendo llamar al 911, mientras el dispositivo recibe una actualización de software hasta que la misma se complete.
El Dispositivo del Abonado se puede conectar automáticamente a hotspots WiFi, incluyendo la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su Servicio Spectrum Internet u otros hotspots WiFi disponibles de Spectrum o terceros.
Cuando el Dispositivo del Abonado está conectado a hotspots WiFi, incluyendo la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su Servicio Spectrum Internet o cualquier otro hotspot WiFi que se conecta a Spectrum Internet, dicho Dispositivo accede a Spectrum Internet y no utiliza el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y está sujeto a los términos y condiciones del Acuerdo de Spectrum Internet.
La conexión de un Dispositivo a hotspots WiFi no está sujeta a las políticas de uso, incluyendo reducción de la velocidad de transmisión, aplicables al Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y descrita en nuestras divulgaciones del ancho de banda del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum en espanol.spectrum.compolicies/mobile-terms.
Se pueden aplicar limitaciones de velocidad sobre el uso de hotspots WiFi de Spectrum a clientes de Spectrum Mobile que interrumpan el Servicio Spectrum Internet.
Se indican más detalles sobre los términos y condiciones del Servicio Spectrum Internet en el Acuerdo de Spectrum Internet en espanol.spectrum.com/policies/residential-terms.
La conexión del Abonado a WiFi puede verse afectada por una variedad de factores incluyendo el Dispositivo, interferencia (de otros dispositivos, edificios u otras señales inalámbricas) o la distancia desde hotspots WiFi, incluyendo la red WiFi en el hogar del Abonado o en otra ubicación.
Inhabilitar la función de conexión WiFi automática puede limitar la disponibilidad de algunas funciones del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y/o reducir su utilización de Spectrum Internet, que le proporciona acceso ilimitado a datos, lo que aumenta su uso de datos mensual del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Según su plan de Servicio Móvil, el aumento en el uso de datos del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum puede incrementar sus cargos mensuales o, si se ha suscrito a un plan de Servicio Móvil ilimitado de Spectrum, el mayor uso de datos puede afectar el rendimiento después de que alcance ciertos niveles o cantidades de descarga.

El rendimiento del Dispositivo puede variar según las especificaciones (por ejemplo, software, memoria y almacenamiento del Dispositivo) y puede afectar el acceso al Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Si el Abonado compró un dispositivo a Spectrum, es posible que se haya programado con un bloqueo de Dispositivo o SIM que evitará que funcione con otros servicios compatibles de operadores de redes móviles.

Cargos de Roaming: Roaming significa cobertura en la red de otro operador de red móvil (“Roaming”).
El Servicio Móvil del Abonado se puede utilizar para llamadas internacionales y Roaming.
El Servicio Móvil originado o recibido al estar fuera del Área de Cobertura incluida en el plan de Servicio Móvil está sujeto a cargos de Roaming.
La capacidad de un Dispositivo de conectarse a una red dentro de la cobertura a una fuera de la cobertura depende del Dispositivo del Abonado, del plan de Servicio Móvil y de la disponibilidad de la cobertura de Roaming.
Es posible que algún Servicio Móvil no esté disponible o funcione de la misma manera cuando se utiliza el Roaming (por ejemplo, servicios de datos, correo de voz o llamada en espera).
El uso del Servicio Móvil en Roaming también depende del soporte para la funcionalidad y la tecnología de red aplicables del proveedor de Roaming.
Es posible que haya tarifas más altas y cargos adicionales (se incluyen cargos para larga distancia, cargas adicionales o llamadas que no logran conectarse) para llamadas internacionales o cuando se está en Roaming.
Se le puede informar o no a los Abonados que están utilizando el Roaming o sobre los costos asociados.
El Roaming puede estar limitado o no disponible si más de la mitad del uso del Servicio Móvil mensual del Abonado durante un período de sesenta (60) días consecutivos se hace fuera del Área de Cobertura incluida en el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (como se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Además, Spectrum puede bloquear el servicio del uso de voz, texto y/o datos mientras se utiliza el Roaming en algunos países de la manera que Spectrum considere razonablemente necesario para evitar un uso no estándar, excesivo, ilícito o fraudulento del Servicio Móvil.
10.
Dispositivo Extraviado o Robado: El Abonado acepta llamar de inmediato a Spectrum si su dispositivo se extravía o se lo roban, de modo que el Servicio Móvil se pueda suspender para impedir que otra persona lo use.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado se utiliza después del extravío o del robo, pero antes de que el Abonado haga la denuncia de la pérdida, y el Abonado quiere obtener crédito por los cargos de ese uso, Spectrum revisará la actividad de la cuenta y cualquier otra información que el Abonado quiera que Spectrum considere para demostrar que los cargos no estaban autorizados.
Se le puede solicitar al Abonado que proporcione o que envíe información para respaldar la reclamación.
Spectrum puede agregar el Dispositivo a la “lista de objetos extraviados y robados” para impedir que se use el Dispositivo en cualquier red de operador de red móvil.
Se puede responsabilizar al Abonado por los cargos si este demora en hacer la denuncia del extravío o del robo y no tiene una buena justificación de esa demora, pero el Abonado no tiene que pagar ningún tipo de cargos de Servicio Móvil que este dispute mientras se investiguen los cargos.
Un Dispositivo extraviado o robado no exime al Abonado de la obligación de pago de ningún Plan de Pago del Dispositivo o Plan de Arrendamiento.
Solo para Abonados de California: Si bien el Abonado no es responsable de los cargos que este no autorizó, Spectrum considera que el hecho de que una llamada se haya hecho desde el Dispositivo del Abonado es una prueba de que la llamada fue autorizada.
Los cargos no autorizados pueden incluir llamadas hechas al Dispositivo del Abonado o desde el Dispositivo del Abonado después de que este se extravió o fue robado.
Si el Abonado no informa de inmediato el extravío o el robo, el Abonado puede ser responsable del uso del Servicio Móvil hasta que se denunció el incidente.
Una vez que se informe a Spectrum que el Dispositivo se ha extraviado o ha sido robado, y el Dispositivo está suspendido, el Abonado no será responsable de los cargos posteriores que se originen por el uso de ese Dispositivo.
Si Spectrum no le ha dado al Abonado una suspensión de cortesía de los cargos mensuales recurrentes durante el año anterior, Spectrum le otorgará al Abonado una (1) suspensión por treinta (30) días hasta que el Abonado reemplace o recupere el Dispositivo, lo que ocurra primero.
11.
Privacidad e Información en un Dispositivo: Tal como se describe en la Política de Privacidad de Spectrum, Spectrum, junto con sus socios, puede recopilar información técnica y de servicio de todos los usuarios del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum durante el suministro de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum o del Dispositivo del Abonado.

Spectrum puede usar esta información técnica y de servicio para proporcionar servicios de datos y de voz móviles, y para mejorar la experiencia de red y la calidad de la experiencia móvil del Abonado.
Un Dispositivo puede contener información personal y confidencial.
Spectrum no es responsable de la información que está guardada en un Dispositivo, lo que incluye información personal o confidencial.
Spectrum recomienda que el Abonado proteja la información personal y confidencial cuando el Dispositivo no está bajo control o posesión del Abonado.
Al entregar un Dispositivo a Spectrum, el Abonado acepta que los empleados, los contratistas o los proveedores de Spectrum pueden acceder a toda la información que hay en un Dispositivo.
Si el Abonado cambia, devuelve o recicla un Dispositivo a través de Spectrum, el Abonado debe retirar todos los datos y la información del Dispositivo antes de entregarlo a Spectrum.
12.
Cargo mensual por servicio: El Abonado acepta pagar el cargo de servicio móvil mensual de Spectrum, el cual está compuesto por diversas tarifas, impuestos y recargos regulatorios o gubernamentales, tales como recargos de fondos para servicios universales a nivel federal o estatal.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho de aumentar o reducir cualquier cargo por el Servicio Móvil que ofrece.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se cancelará en el caso de que el Abonado no pague.
Los cargos mensuales y de uso se facturarán tal como se especifica en el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado (que se describe en es.mobile.spectrum.com/plans).
Según el Servicio Móvil del Abonado, los cargos por servicios adicionales pueden incluir asistencia de directorio y de operador, correo de voz, desvío de llamadas, llamadas de datos, textos y acceso a Internet.
Spectrum puede cobrar cargos por activación, prepago, reactivación, programa, Dispositivo, Plan de Arrendamiento, cargos de planes de cuotas u otros cargos para establecer, cambiar o mantener el Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Algunas transacciones también pueden estar sujetas a cambios (por ejemplo, facilidad de pago, cambio de números de teléfono o actualizaciones de teléfono).
Spectrum notificará al Abonado si algunas de estas tarifas se aplican a las transacciones solicitadas.
Para determinar el lugar de uso principal (“PPU”, por sus siglas en inglés) del Abonado, y qué impuestos y valoraciones de la jurisdicción se cobran, el Abonado debe proporcionar a Spectrum su dirección residencial.
Si el Abonado no proporciona la dirección a Spectrum, o si la misma queda fuera del Área de Cobertura de Spectrum, Spectrum puede designar de manera razonable un PPU dentro del Área de Cobertura del Abonado.
El Abonado debe vivir y tener una dirección postal dentro del Área de Cobertura de Spectrum.
Si el Abonado intenta usar un Dispositivo en una dirección alternativa, este debe comunicarse con Spectrum al (833) 224-6603 para actualizar el PPU de su cuenta.
13.

Es posible que los cargos por Roaming y datos internacionales no aparezcan en un resumen de cuenta durante el ciclo de facturación cuando las llamadas y/o el uso de datos se hicieron debido a las demoras en la recepción y la revisión de dichos registros.
Si el Abonado recibe un Dispositivo o Servicio Móvil en una promoción, una vez que termine el período de la promoción, se aplicarán los precios de mercado que estaban vigentes en ese entonces para el Dispositivo o el Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Para los cargos en función de la cantidad de tiempo utilizado o para los datos enviados o recibidos, Spectrum redondeará las fracciones al siguiente minuto completo o, según cómo se le facture al Abonado por el uso de datos, al siguiente megabyte (“MB”) o gigabyte (“GB”) completos.
Para las llamadas salientes, el tiempo de uso comienza cuando el Abonado presiona ‘ENVIAR’ (o tecla similar) o cuando la llamada se conecta a la red.
y para las llamadas entrantes, comienza cuando la llamada se conecta a la red (que puede ser antes de que suene).
El tiempo de uso puede terminar varios segundos después de que el Abonado presione “FINALIZAR” (o tecla similar) o después de que se desconecta la llamada.
Para las llamadas que se hacen en la red, Spectrum solo cobrará las llamadas que se respondan, lo que incluye las respuestas de contestadores automáticos.
El uso no siempre se puede procesar de inmediato y es posible que se incluya en una factura posterior.
Los Abonados con un plan de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum ilimitado pagarán un cargo mensual por el Servicio de conformidad con los términos de dicho plan.
Para los Abonados con un plan de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum en función de la cantidad de tiempo utilizado y/o de los datos enviados o recibidos, al Abonado se le cobrarán todos los datos enviados, recibidos, consumidos por el Abonado y/o utilizados en la cuenta del Abonado, lo que incluye, entre otros, datos consumidos por las aplicaciones (incluso todo Servicio Móvil de Spectrum y/u otras aplicaciones de Spectrum), widgets, mensajería multimedia, conexión, carga, descarga, streaming de Contenido, acceso a Internet (incluso el acceso a intranets corporativas, correos electrónicos y aplicaciones de productividad individuales), GPS y servicios de localización y voz sobre protocolo de Internet (lo que incluye toda sobrecarga de la red y/o sobrecarga de protocolo de Internet asociado con el Contenido enviado o recibido).
Al final de cada ciclo de facturación, el uso de datos para una cuenta con una sola línea que recibe el Servicio Móvil de manera prepagada se redondeará al siguiente MB o GB, según el plan de Servicio Móvil del Abonado.
Por ejemplo, si el Abonado utiliza 1.2 GB de datos durante un ciclo de facturación, al Abonado se le facturará un uso de 2 GB.
Al final de cada ciclo de facturación, el uso de datos para una cuenta con varias líneas que recibe el Servicio Móvil de manera prepagada se puede agregar y luego redondear al siguiente GB, según las condiciones del plan de su Servicio Móvil.
Si un Abonado selecciona un plan de Servicio Móvil de una promoción que incluye una asignación predeterminada de Servicio Móvil (por ejemplo, una asignación predeterminada de gigabytes o mensajes), salvo que se establezca específicamente lo contrario como parte de dicho plan de Servicio Móvil, toda asignación no utilizada de Servicio Móvil de un ciclo de facturación no se transferirá a ningún otro ciclo de facturación.
El primer ciclo de facturación del Abonado comenzará al activar el Dispositivo o siete (7) días después de la fecha de envío del Dispositivo, lo que ocurra primero, y la primera factura del Abonado puede incluir cargos mensuales parciales del servicio además de los cargos mencionados anteriormente.
Todas las facturas de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum estarán disponibles a través de la aplicación y el portal de Internet Mi Cuenta.
Al Abonado se le facturará de manera separada por el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum desde cualquier otro servicio de Spectrum, lo que incluye Spectrum Internet o Spectrum TV.
14.
Cambios No Autorizados: EL ABONADO DEBE TENER CUIDADO CUANDO PERMITA QUE OTRA PERSONA, LO QUE INCLUYE UN HIJO U OTRO MENOR, USE UN DISPOSITIVO DE SU CUENTA.
El Abonado está obligado a pagar todos los cargos en los que incurra, incluso los cargos de cualquier otro usuario de un Dispositivo asociado con la cuenta del Abonado.
Se puede acceder a muchos servicios y aplicaciones en o a través de un Dispositivo, lo que incluye compras de juegos, películas, música y otro tipo de Contenido.
Algunos de estos servicios son provistos por Spectrum.
Otros son provistos por terceros que pueden ofrecer la opción de cargos de facturación a la factura de Spectrum del Abonado u otros métodos de pago.
Los cargos pueden ser únicos o recurrentes.
Si al comprador se le permite que se le facturen los cargos en la cuenta del Abonado y se elige esta opción, dichos cargos formarán parte del monto adeudado para ese ciclo de facturación.
El Abonado es exclusivamente responsable de todos los cargos a dichos terceros, lo que incluye todas las tarifas correspondientes.
Además, el Abonado es el único responsable de proteger la seguridad de la tarjeta de crédito y de otro tipo de información personal provista a otros en relación con dichas transacciones.
Spectrum puede aceptar brindar servicios de facturación en nombre de terceros, como agente de ese tercero.
Spectrum no será responsable de ninguna disputa con respecto a los cargos entre el Abonado y un tercero.
El Abonado debe resolver todas estas disputas directamente con el tercero.
15.

Los derechos de Spectrum en esta sección son adicionales a los derechos específicos que Spectrum se reserva en otras disposiciones de este Acuerdo o en otras Condiciones del Servicio para interrumpir, suspender, modificar o cancelar el Servicio Móvil del Abonado y para cancelar el Acuerdo del Abonado.
16.
Transferencia: El Abonado puede traspasar o “transferir” su número de teléfono móvil a otro operador de red móvil.
Si el Abonado transfiere un número desde Spectrum, Spectrum considerará que el Abonado solicita a Spectrum la cancelación del Servicio Móvil del Abonado para ese número.
Una vez que se complete la transferencia, el Abonado ya no podrá usar el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para ese número, pero el Abonado seguirá siendo responsable de todas las tarifas y los cargos de Servicio Móvil en los que incurrió hasta el final de ese ciclo de facturación, y de todos los cargos de Dispositivos, al igual que cualquier otro tipo de cancelación.
Si el Abonado transfiere un número a Spectrum, es posible que Spectrum no pueda brindar de inmediato algunos servicios, como por ejemplo los servicios E-911.
El Abonado reconoce y acepta que, salvo que lo exija una ley correspondiente, el Abonado no tiene derechos exclusivos sobre el número de móvil que Spectrum le asigne, salvo el derecho que el Abonado pueda tener para transferir el número.
17.
Información de Ubicación: El Dispositivo del Abonado o el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum pueden determinar la ubicación geográfica física del Dispositivo y del Abonado (“Información de Ubicación”).
Tal como se describe en la Política de Privacidad de Spectrum, Spectrum, junto con sus socios, puede recopilar automáticamente Información de Ubicación u otros datos del cliente durante el suministro de Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Spectrum, junto con sus socios y/o proveedor de servicio de red, pueden usar esta Información de Ubicación, datos del cliente e información de uso y rendimiento que se obtiene de la red o del Dispositivo del Abonado para suministrar servicios móviles de datos y de voz, y para mejorar la experiencia de la red y de la calidad del servicio móvil del Abonado.
La Información de Ubicación también se puede utilizar para crear datos globales de los cuales la información de carácter personal ha sido eliminada u ocultada.
Estos datos globales se pueden utilizar para una variedad de fines (por ejemplo, para investigación científica y de marketing, volumen de tráfico de vehículos y monitoreo).
Es responsabilidad del Abonado notificar a los usuarios de su cuenta que la información de uso del Servicio Móvil o de los Dispositivos de dichos usuarios vinculados con la cuenta del Abonado puede ser recopilada.
El Dispositivo del Abonado también puede usar Contenido opcional a solicitud del Abonado o a solicitud de un usuario en la cuenta del Abonado, ofrecido por Spectrum o terceros que usan la Información de ubicación del Dispositivo (“Servicio en Función de la Ubicación”).
El Abonado debe revisar los términos y las condiciones, y la política de privacidad relacionada para cada Servicio en función de la ubicación para saber cómo se utilizará y protegerá la información de ubicación.
Si el Abonado no quiere que el Servicio en función de la ubicación recopile o use la Información de ubicación, deberá desactivar los servicios de localización en el Dispositivo mediante las configuraciones del Dispositivo.
18.
911 y Alertas de Emergencia: Cuando se hacen llamadas a un punto de respuesta de seguridad pública (“PSAP”, por sus siglas en inglés) desde un Dispositivo, como por ejemplo cuando se marca el 911, el Abonado siempre debe estar preparado para brindar su ubicación y número de teléfono.
A diferencia de un teléfono fijo tradicional, un PSAP puede no conocer el número de teléfono o la ubicación de la persona que llama.
Si bien algunas autoridades de emergencia a nivel local han activado los servicios E-911 que usan GPS u otros métodos para determinar las ubicaciones de las personas que llaman, el E-911 no siempre brinda información de localización precisa.
Si el Dispositivo del Abonado está en el interior, no puede obtener la señal satelital o no puede obtener la ubicación de la persona que llama, es posible que la Información de ubicación no se transmita automáticamente al PSAP.
Además, el proceso de transferencia de un número de teléfono puede impedir que el Servicio Móvil brinde servicios de ubicación al PSAP durante ese tiempo.
Si el Abonado hace una llamada al 911, el operador puede ver un número de teléfono que es diferente del número de teléfono personal del Abonado.
En algunos casos, puede ocurrir que el PSAP no pueda volver a llamar al Abonado.
Las llamadas al 911 a través de WiFi o una conexión de datos pueden funcionar de manera diferente a las llamadas al 911 desde teléfonos fijos tradicionales.
Es posible que estas llamadas no se conecten al PSAP, puedan ser limitadas o puedan no estar disponibles si el Abonado está experimentando un corte de energía, si hay una interrupción del servicio de Wi-Fi o en la conexión de datos, o si el Abonado no puede tener acceso a Internet.
Si la llamada del Abonado se conecta al PSAP, es posible que su información de ubicación y número de teléfono no se transmitan.
Además, si el Abonado no ha actualizado su dirección 911 de emergencia en las configuraciones de su Dispositivo, el Dispositivo puede proporcionar un PSAP con Información de ubicación que sea diferente a la ubicación de llamada del Abonado.
El Abonado debe estar preparado para brindar su ubicación y número de teléfono al PSAP.
Si el Abonado es sordo, tiene problemas de audición o de habla y necesita comunicarse con los servicios de emergencia, el Abonado debe llamar directamente al 911 mediante el TTY o el servicio de retransmisión de telecomunicaciones.
Spectrum también puede proporcionar servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos en partes de su Área de Cobertura en dispositivos que admitan alertas de emergencia.
No se cobran cargos adicionales por estos servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos.
Es posible que los servicios de alerta de emergencia inalámbricos no estén disponibles en todos los Dispositivos o en toda el Área de Cobertura, o si el Abonado se encuentra fuera del Área de Cobertura.
En las áreas en que se transmiten las alertas de emergencia, es posible que dichas alertas no sean recibidas por un Abonado o usuario del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, incluso si el usuario tiene un Dispositivo con capacidad para recibirlas.

<p> SERVICIO MÓVIL RESIDENCIAL DE SPECTRUM DIVULGACIONES DEL ANCHO DE BANDA</p> El servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil residencial de Spectrum de Charter ("Servicio Móvil de Spectrum", "Servicio" o "Spectrum") utiliza la red del servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil de nuestro(s) socio(s) de red móvil ("MNP", por sus siglas en inglés) y está sujeto a sus prácticas y controles de administración de la red.
Las siguientes divulgaciones reflejan, cuando corresponda, esas prácticas y controles.
Estas divulgaciones no describen las prácticas, las características o los términos que se aplican cuando nuestros clientes usan el servicio de roaming en redes móviles que no sean las de nuestro MNP.
Para adquirir el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, el Abonado debe ser un cliente actual de Spectrum Internet o debe comprar Spectrum Internet en el momento de la adquisición del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
Mientras el Abonado siga siendo cliente de Spectrum Internet, tendrá acceso a hotspots WiFi de Spectrum.
Prácticas de red Los siguientes puntos brindan un resumen de las prácticas de red aplicables al Servicio Móvil de Spectrum.
• Bloqueo El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no bloquea ni evita el acceso del usuario final a contenido legal, aplicaciones, servicios o dispositivos no nocivos.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum participa en prácticas razonables de administración de la red que se describen a continuación.
• Variación El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no deteriora ni daña el acceso al tráfico legal de Internet con base en el contenido, la aplicación, el servicio, el usuario o la utilización de un dispositivo no nocivo.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum realiza prácticas de administración de la red razonables que se describen a continuación, incluyendo limitar la reproducción de video a calidad de DVD (generalmente 480p) para clientes que usan la red de nuestro MNP.
• Priorización de afiliados El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no favorece de manera directa o indirecta a parte del tráfico sobre otro tráfico, incluso mediante el uso de técnicas como modelado del tráfico, priorización o reserva de recursos, para beneficiar a un afiliado.
• Priorización pagada El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no favorece de manera directa o indirecta a parte del tráfico sobre otro tráfico, incluso mediante el uso de técnicas como modelado del tráfico, priorización o reserva de recursos, a cambio de consideración, compensación monetaria o de otro tipo.
• Administración de la congestión En la red móvil.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se esfuerza por ofrecer a sus clientes la mejor experiencia cuando utilizan la red de nuestro MNP.
Sin embargo, la experiencia de un usuario individual variará según muchos factores, incluyendo la red de MNP (3G Ev-DO o 4G LTE) que el cliente esté utilizando y el dispositivo móvil ("dispositivo") en uso.
Nuestro MNP usa tecnologías de optimización y transcodificación en las redes 3G Ev-DO y 4G LTE para transmitir archivos de datos de manera más eficiente para permitir que la capacidad de red disponible beneficie a la mayor cantidad de usuarios.
Estas técnicas incluyen menos almacenamiento en cache de datos, usar menos capacidad y ajustar el tamaño de los archivos de video de manera más apropiada para los dispositivos móviles.
Estas técnicas son independientes del contenido en sí y del sitio web que lo proporciona.
Si bien estas técnicas pretenden evitar cambios en archivos de texto, imágenes y video, y aunque es probable que el cliente no pueda detectar cambios en el archivo, el proceso de optimización puede tener un impacto mínimo en la apariencia del archivo tal como se muestra en el dispositivo móvil del cliente.
En WiFi.
Cuando los clientes del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se conectan a través de WiFi, las prácticas de administración de la congestión aplicables a esa conexión variarán según el proveedor de servicio de Internet ("ISP").
En los hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, Spectrum utiliza prácticas razonables de administración de la red que cumplen con las normas de la industria.
Puede obtener información adicional sobre las prácticas de Spectrum en cuanto a la administración de la congestión aquí.
Spectrum no es responsable de las técnicas de administración de la congestión que usan otros ISP para sus redes WiFi.
Si su dispositivo se conecta con la red WiFi de otro ISP, debe consultar las condiciones del servicio y divulgaciones del ancho de banda de ese proveedor para obtener información sobre sus prácticas.
Las técnicas de optimización y transcodificación descritas anteriormente en el punto En la red móvil no se aplican cuando un dispositivo está utilizando WiFi de Spectrum (y no pueden ser utilizados por otros proveedores de servicios WiFi) para transmitir datos y, por lo tanto, los archivos de texto, imágenes y video se transmitirán por WiFi a la resolución nativa.
Roaming.
Para aquellas áreas geográficas que no cuentan con servicios de red móvil administrados por y de propiedad de nuestros MNP, los MNP celebran acuerdos con otros proveedores de red móvil.
El uso de dispositivos de los clientes para acceder a datos a través de las redes de otro proveedor, tanto nacionales como internacionales, se denomina uso de "roaming".
Nuestra capacidad para hacer que los servicios estén disponibles para los clientes en estas otras redes móviles se basa en una variedad de factores dinámicos, que incluyen consideraciones comerciales, los términos de los acuerdos que nuestros MNP tienen en un momento determinado con otros proveedores de redes móviles, la tecnología de la red, la(s) frecuencia(s) y la funcionalidad de esas redes.
El uso del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum en roaming depende del soporte para la funcionalidad y la tecnología de red aplicables del proveedor de roaming.
Consulte con proveedores de redes de roaming de forma individual para conocer detalles de compatibilidad y cobertura.
Los dispositivos pueden transmitir y recibir mensajes de datos sin la intervención del usuario y pueden generar cargos inesperados cuando están "encendidos" fuera de los Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de EE.
UU.
Algunos países y/o proveedores dentro de una zona con servicio de roaming pueden no estar disponibles durante el roaming.
No garantizamos la disponibilidad, calidad de cobertura o velocidad de los servicios de roaming a los que se accede a través de otras redes de proveedores de redes móviles y podemos reducir las velocidades a 2G o suspender el servicio de roaming disponible en estas redes en cualquier momento sin previo aviso.
• Conducta específica de cada aplicación Puede acceder a cualquier aplicación legal para usar en el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, sujeta a nuestros Términos y Condiciones Generales del Servicio Residencial, Prácticas de Administración de la Red, Acuerdo de Servicios Móviles Residenciales de Spectrum y la Política de Privacidad tratados en estas divulgaciones.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho de intervenir en todo momento para proteger la integridad de sus servicios, incluyendo el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum, y la red.
Si bien Spectrum no favorece a ciertos sitios web o aplicaciones de Internet al bloquear, reducir la velocidad o modificar protocolos particulares, puertos de protocolo o campos de protocolo en formas no establecidas por las normas de protocolo, podemos evitar el uso de ciertos puertos en nuestro servicio WiFi de Spectrum que se utilizan comúnmente para propagar malware y participar en otras actividades maliciosas.
• Normas para dispositivos accesorios Puede activar dispositivos que Charter ha certificado que son compatibles con su red, incluidos los dispositivos que no se compraron directamente a Charter.
Aquí está disponible una herramienta para comprobar si su dispositivo actual está aprobado para su uso en nuestra red.
Puede encontrar información sobre cómo obtener un dispositivo móvil, incluyendo la lista de dispositivos móviles aprobados y sus precios, aquí.
Según la capacidad de su dispositivo móvil, está permitido usar el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para crear un hotspot móvil a fin de conectarse con otros dispositivos conforme a los términos, las condiciones y las opciones de precios de datos de su Servicio Móvil de Spectrum (consulte las Condiciones comerciales a continuación) y sujeto a las prácticas y los controles de administración de la red de nuestros MNP.
• Seguridad Spectrum reconoce que una red confiable debe ser, entre otras cosas, una red segura.
Nosotros, junto con nuestro MNP, trabajamos para proteger la red contra ataques externos, alteraciones, actividad maliciosa y eventos de red que de alguna manera puedan interrumpir o deteriorar la capacidad de los clientes del Servicio Móvil de Spectrum para usar la red.
Nuestro MNP bloquea una cantidad limitada de direcciones de Internet que son disruptivas o maliciosas y generalmente persistentes, con base en el análisis y la inteligencia de terceros.
Nuestro MNP no bloquea los sitios por el contenido o el tema, a menos que la dirección de Internet aloje contenido ilegal.
Nuestro MNP revisa y modifica regularmente la lista de direcciones de Internet bloqueadas, eliminando cualquiera que ya no se percibe como una amenaza.
Características de rendimiento • Descripción del servicio En la red móvil.
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum ofrece a sus clientes servicios de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil a través de redes de banda ancha móvil 3G Ev-DO y 4G LTE.
Según pruebas internas y pruebas solicitadas a proveedores externos de nuestro MNP, Spectrum espera que los clientes cuenten con las siguientes velocidades en el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum: • Red 4G LTE: velocidad de descarga normal de 5-12 megabits por segundo (Mbps) y velocidad de carga de 2-5 Mbps.
• Red 3G Ev-DO: velocidad de descarga normal de 600 kilobits por segundo (Kbps)-1.4 Mbps y velocidad de carga de 500-800 Kbps para dispositivos Ev-DO Rev.
A (si utiliza un dispositivo Ev-DO Rev.
0, la velocidad de descarga normal es de 400-700 Kbps y de carga 60-80 Kbps).
La reproducción de video con calidad de DVD admite velocidad 4G (generalmente, el video se reproduce en 480p).
Con respecto a la latencia en el uso de aplicaciones con datos en tiempo real, nuestro MNP espera que la latencia de red a dispositivo móvil (y viceversa) sea inferior a 100 milisegundos (ms) en la red 4G de nuestro MNP y menos de 240 ms en su red 3G Ev -DO.
La latencia es el tiempo de demora en la transmisión o recepción de paquetes en una red.
La latencia es principalmente una función de la distancia entre dos puntos en la transmisión, pero también puede verse afectada por la cantidad y la calidad de las conexiones a la red o redes utilizadas en la transmisión.
Actualmente, nuestro MNP no informa datos de pérdida de paquetes, por lo que el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum no tiene la capacidad técnica de medir la pérdida de paquetes en la red.
La pérdida de paquetes es el porcentaje de paquetes que envía el origen pero no los recibe el destino.
Esto a veces se debe a la congestión a lo largo de la ruta pero también puede reflejar un deterioro en la red.
Debe usar un dispositivo móvil 4G LTE y estar en el área de cobertura 4G LTE de nuestro MNP para acceder a su red 4G LTE.
Debe usar un dispositivo móvil que admita 3G Ev-DO y estar en el área de cobertura 3G Ev-DO de nuestro MNP para acceder a su red 3G Ev-DO.
Para obtener información sobre la cobertura 4G y 3G, haga clic aquí.
Los clientes con dispositivos 4G LTE tendrán acceso a la red 3G Ev-DO donde esté disponible fuera del área de cobertura 4G LTE.
Las velocidades reales que experimente en la red de nuestro MNP dependerán de muchos factores, incluidos, entre otros, el tipo de dispositivo móvil, los programas que se ejecutan en el dispositivo móvil, su ubicación y cuántos otros clientes están intentando utilizar los mismos recursos del espectro (incluyendo el acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil y otros servicios de acceso a Internet sin banda ancha que comparten la red).
En WiFi de Spectrum.
Los resultados anteriores no reflejan el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum experimentado por los clientes conectados a hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet).
El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum se puede conectar automáticamente a hotspots WiFi de Spectrum (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet) cuando esté disponible a menos que el cliente cambie la configuración del dispositivo móvil para inhabilitar dicha funcionalidad.
El rendimiento en cualquier red WiFi, incluyendo hotspots WiFi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, puede variar en función de varios factores, tales como, aunque no exclusivamente, la cantidad de otros abonados que intentan usar el mismo enrutador WiFi al mismo tiempo, su dispositivo móvil, su antena de recepción WiFi, su distancia hasta el enrutador WiFi, la atenuación de las paredes y el follaje, y la interferencia de otros dispositivos móviles que utilizan el mismo espectro.
WiFi usa el espectro que la FCC ha asignado para el uso "sin licencia", lo que significa que el uso de este espectro no está protegido de la interferencia de otros dispositivos móviles que usan el mismo espectro en la misma área geográfica.
Por lo tanto, los hotspots Wi-Fi de Spectrum fuera del hogar, así como cualquier conexión WiFi a través del servicio Spectrum Internet de su hogar, se brindan haciendo los "mejores esfuerzos".
Cuando no esté conectado a hotspots Wi-Fi de Spectrum fuera del hogar (o la red WiFi de su hogar que está conectada a su servicio Spectrum Internet), el Servicio Móvil de Spectrum intentará conectarse a través de la red del servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil de nuestro MNP.
Puede encontrar información adicional sobre WiFi de Spectrum en nuestras Prácticas de Administración de la Red, nuestra Política de Uso Autorizado de Internet y el Acuerdo del Servicio de Internet Residencial, cada uno de los cuales está incorporado en nuestros Términos y Condiciones Generales del Servicio Residencial.
• Otros servicios en la red El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum usa la red del servicio de acceso a Internet de banda ancha móvil de nuestro MNP y comparte esa red con esos servicios y otros servicios de acceso a Internet sin banda ancha que ofrece nuestro MNP.

El Servicio Móvil de Spectrum actualmente ofrece dos opciones de precios para la adquisición de datos.
By the Gig.
Con la opción de datos "By the Gig", se le cobrará $14.00 por mes por adelantado por cada línea de servicio (las tarifas promocionales pueden variar).
Cada línea recibirá un gigabyte (GB) de datos que se pueden compartir entre todas las líneas By the Gig en la misma cuenta.
Si las líneas By the Gig de la cuenta superan en forma colectiva la asignación inicial de datos de 1 GB por línea, se agrega automáticamente un GB adicional de datos compartidos a la cuenta y usted pagará $14.00 adicionales por GB, ya sea que use el gigabyte completo o no.
Por ejemplo, si una cuenta con una sola línea utiliza 1.2 GB de datos durante un ciclo de facturación, al abonado se le facturará un uso de 2 GB de datos para ese ciclo de facturación.
De la misma manera, si una cuenta con una sola línea utiliza en conjunto 3.2 GB de datos durante un ciclo de facturación, incluso si una o dos de las líneas usa menos de 1 GB, al abonado se le facturará un GB adicional para ese ciclo de facturación.
Si desea usar una tablet con su Servicio Móvil de Spectrum con By the Gig, debe comprar un plan "By the Gig Tablet" incluso si también tiene el plan By the Gig para su smartphone u otros dispositivos.
Con la opción de datos "By the Gig Tablet", se le cobrarán $ 14.00 por mes por adelantado por cada tablet (las tarifas promocionales pueden variar) y obtendrá un gigabyte (GB) por línea de datos compartibles para usar entre todos los dispositivos con By the Gig Tablet y cualquier smartphone con línea By the Gig en la misma cuenta.
Si usa más de su asignación de datos inicial, si hubiere, de 1 GB por tablet y su asignación inicial de 1 GB por línea entre todas sus tablets y líneas, entonces pagará $14.00 adicionales por gigabyte, o gigabytes parciales, por cuenta en su próxima factura.
Ilimitados.
La opción datos "ilimitados" proporciona datos ilimitados a una tarifa mensual regular de $45.00 por línea (las tarifas promocionales pueden variar), con velocidades reducidas a 1 Mbps de descarga y 512 Kbps de carga después de 20 gigabytes (GB) de uso de datos en un mes entre todos los smartphones u otros dispositivos que usen la misma línea.
A estas velocidades, la funcionalidad de algunas aplicaciones de datos como la reproducción de video o audio puede verse afectada.
