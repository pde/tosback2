<p>Internet Authorized Usage Policy</p> SPECTRUM INTERNET ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
<p>In order to provide high quality customer service and to ensure the integrity, security, and reliability of the Internet Network of Charter Communications Operating LLC and its respective affiliates and subsidiaries providing services (“Spectrum”), Spectrum has created this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
This AUP applies along with the Terms and Conditions of Service governing the Subscriber's use of Spectrum's Internet and related services (collectively, the “Terms of Service”), Spectrum's Privacy Policy and Spectrum's Network Management Practices Statement, to specify use restrictions and requirements applicable to users of the Service.
The Subscriber recognizes and agrees that the then current version of the AUP to be maintained by Spectrum and posted on Spectrum's website will supersede all previous versions of this document and that Subscriber's continued use of Spectrum's Internet service will constitute Subscriber's acceptance of this policy as it may be amended.</p>
<p>By using the Service, the Subscriber agrees to abide by, and require each user of the Service to abide by, the terms of this AUP and associated Terms of Service.
Any user who does not agree to be bound by these terms must immediately cease use of the Service and notify the Spectrum Customer Service Department to terminate the account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use.
The Service is designed for personal and family use (residential use only) within a single household.
Subscriber agrees that only Subscriber and Subscriber's authorized guests in the same household will use the Service.
Subscriber is responsible for any misuse of the Service that occurs through Subscriber's account, whether by a member of Subscriber's household or an authorized or unauthorized third-party.
Subscriber will not use, or enable others to use, the Service to operate any type of business or commercial enterprise, including, but not limited to, IP address translation or similar facilities intended to provide additional access.
Subscriber will not resell or redistribute, or enable others to resell or redistribute, access to the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, through the use of wireless technology.
Spectrum reserves the right at its sole discretion to immediately suspend, terminate, or restrict use of the Service without notice if such use violates the AUP or the Terms of Service, is objectionable or unlawful, or interferes with Spectrum's systems, or Internet Network, the Internet, or others' use of the Service.</li>
<li>Prohibited Activities Using the System, Network, and Service.
Any activity or use of the Service which violates system or network security or integrity are prohibited and may result in criminal and civil liability.
Such violations include, without limitation, the following:<ol>
<li>Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems, or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a system or network, or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network.</li>
<li>Unauthorized monitoring of data or traffic on any network or system without express authorization of the owner or network;</li>
<li>Interference with Internet service to any user, host, or network, including but not limited to: mail bombing, flooding, or denial of service attacks.</li>
<li>Forging the header of any transmitted information packet, email, or Usenet posting;</li>
<li>Modifying or tampering with any hardware, software, or configuration provided by Spectrum including but not limited to: routers, switches, and cable modem configuration files.</li>
<li>Reselling or otherwise redistributing the Service.</li>
<li>Disrupting, degrading or otherwise adversely affecting Spectrum's network or computer equipment owned by Spectrum or other Spectrum subscribers.</li>
<li>Transmit unsolicited bulk or commercial messages commonly known as "spam."</li>
<li>Assuming or assigning a Spectrum IP address that was not allocated to the user by Spectrum or its network - all Spectrum Internet users must use DHCP assigned by the Service to acquire an IP address.</li>
<li>Either of the following activities by a Subscriber using dedicated machines (also known as "machines" or "dedicated servers") or virtual dedicated servers (also known as "VDS", "VPS", "virtual machines", and/or "virtual servers"): (i) running a tunnel or proxy to a server at another host or (ii) hosting, storing, proxy, or use of a network testing utility or denial of service (DoS/DDoS) tool in any capacity.</li>
<li>Because the Service is for residential use only, any use of the service for non-residential purposes is not permitted and may result in reduction in service, suspension, or termination at the sole discretion of Spectrum.
Non-residential purposes include, without limitation, the following:</li>
<li>Running any type of server on the system that is not consistent with personal, residential use.
This includes but is not limited to FTP, IRC, SMTP, POP, HTTP, SOCS, SQUID, NTP, DNS or any multi-user forums.</li>
<li>Distributing in any way information, software or other material obtained through the service or otherwise that is protected by copyright or other proprietary right, without obtaining any required permission of the owner.</li>
<li>IP address translation or similar facilities intended to provide additional access.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>No Illegal or Fraudulent Use.
The Service may be used only for lawful purposes.
Subscriber will not use or allow others to use the service in any manner that is in violation of any applicable federal, state, local or international laws or regulations or to promote, engage in, or enable illegal activity or conduct that violates or infringes upon the rights of any person.
Transmission or distribution of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited.
This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, illegal, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.
Furthermore, use of the Service to impersonate a person or entity is not permitted.</li>
<li>Security/Abuse of Resources.
User is solely responsible for the security of any device connected to the Service, including any data stored on that device.
Users shall take all necessary steps to avoid actions that result in the abuse of a resource on their network.
Examples of abuse of resources include without limitation: open news servers, open SMTP servers, unsecure wireless routers, and unsecure proxy servers.
In the instance when the Subscriber is using a wireless router, Spectrum requires that any wireless network be secure and encrypted.
Open, unencrypted wireless networks are strictly prohibited.<br>
<br>
Should an issue arise, Subscriber is required to address the problem in a timely fashion.
Failure to address an issue after notification will be considered a violation of this AUP.</li>
<li>Network Management.
Spectrum uses a variety of reasonable network management tools and practices consistent with industry standards.
In the event the periods of congestion necessitate such management, Spectrum has available the following tools and practices (without limitation and as may be adjusted over time): (i) Subscriber Traffic Management (STM) technology to temporarily lower the priority of traffic with the greatest impact on peak congestion.
(ii) spam filtering and detection techniques.
and (iii) measures to protect the security and integrity of its network, resources and subscribers (e.g., IP reputation services from multiple sources to deny mail relay to suspect IPs off Charter IP space, real-time IP block lists to determine whether to accept a connection to inbound mail servers, port security techniques such as encryption and authentication, and email server-to-server traffic monitoring).
In limited instances if employed, these techniques may affect the throughput rate at which subscribers may send and receive data, the ability of users to establish session connections within the network, or result in the delay of certain traffic during times of peak congestion.<br>
<br>
For more information about Spectrum's network management practices and policies, please see the Spectrum Network Management Practices Statement</li>
<li>Viruses.
Users must take appropriate action to prevent their systems from becoming infected with and/or distributing computer viruses such as but not limited to worms, "Trojan horses", denial of service attacks, and bots.
Spectrum will take appropriate (as decided by Spectrum's sole discretion) action against Users infected with computer viruses or worms to prevent further spread.</li>
<li>Enforcement.
Spectrum reserves the right to investigate violations of this AUP, including the gathering of information from the Subscriber or other Users involved and the complaining party, if any, and the examination of material on Spectrum's servers and network.
Spectrum prefers to advise Users of AUP violations and any necessary corrective action but, if Spectrum, in its sole discretion, determines that a User has violated the AUP, Spectrum will take any responsive action that is deemed appropriate without prior notification.
Such action includes but is not limited to: temporary suspension of service, reduction of service resources, and termination of service.
Spectrum is not liable for any such responsive action and these actions are not exclusive.
Spectrum may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.</li>
<li>No Waiver.
The failure by Spectrum or its affiliates to enforce any provision of this Policy at any given point in time shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any future time thereafter.</li>
<li>Revisions to Policy.
Spectrum reserves the right to update or modify this Policy at any time and from time to time with or without prior notice.
Continued use of the Service will be deemed acknowledgment and acceptance of this Policy.
Notice of modifications to this Policy may be given by posting such changes on Spectrum's website at www.spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies," by email or by conventional mail, and will be effective immediately upon posting or sending.
Subscribers should regularly visit Spectrum's website and review this Policy to ensure that their activities conform to the most recent version.
In the event of a conflict between any subscriber agreement and this Policy, the terms of this Policy will govern.
Questions regarding this Policy should be directed to AUPQuestions@charter.com.
Complaints of violations of it by Charter Subscribers can be directed to abuse@charter.net.</li>

Subscriber acknowledges that Subscriber may incur charges while using these services or while engaging in other forms of "e-commerce" (i.e.
charges may be incurred as a result of accessing certain information, or purchasing or subscribing to certain offerings using these functions).
All such charges, including applicable taxes shall be paid by Subscriber and are not the responsibility of Spectrum.</li>
<li>Disruption of Cable Service: In no event shall Spectrum be liable for any failure or interruption of program transmissions or Cable Service resulting in part or entirely from circumstances beyond Spectrum's reasonable control (including without limitation, any interruption or degradation of Cable Service arising from Subscriber's interference, modification or tampering with the Cable Service of digital receiver connection).
Subject to requirements under applicable law, credit may be given for qualifying outages.</li>

<li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting or abrogating any other rights Spectrum may have under the General Terms and Conditions for Service, in the event particular programming becomes unavailable, either on a temporary or permanent basis, due to a dispute between Spectrum and a third party programmer, Spectrum shall not be liable for compensation, damages (including compensatory, direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential losses or damages), credits or refunds of fees for the missing or omitted programming.
Subscriber's sole recourse in such an event shall be termination of the Cable Service in accordance with the General Terms and Conditions for Service.

channels that are not part of a package or tier).
provided, however, in that event Spectrum may provide to Customer a pro rata credit of amounts pre-paid for the specific programming to which Subscriber subscribes on an a la carte basis.</li>
</ol>
</li>

The Subscriber's continued use of the Cable Service following notice of such change, modification or amendment shall be deemed to be the Subscriber's acceptance of any such modification.

<li>Spectrum’s Right to Pursue Remedies and Subscriber’s Indemnification Obligations.
If Subscriber breaches these General Terms, Spectrum has the right to seek compensation from Subscriber for such breach through arbitration or, if Subscriber has opted out of these General Terms’ arbitration provision or we are seeking an order requiring you to do or refrain from doing something, in court.
Additionally, if any person or entity brings a claim against Spectrum that arises out of Subscriber’s relationship with Spectrum, the Services provided to Subscriber, the General Terms, or Subscriber’s breach thereof or failure to comply therewith, Subscriber will indemnify, defend (at Spectrum’s exclusive election), and release Spectrum from liability and reimburse Spectrum for any losses that Spectrum may incur, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as a result of such claim.
Subscriber’s responsibilities under this Section cover any dispute, whether arising under contract, tort (for example, a negligence or product liability claim), violation of law or regulation or any other legal theory.</li>
<li>Security Deposit: Any security deposit required of Subscriber for the Equipment or Spectrum's Service will be due and payable upon the first monthly billing.
Such security deposits will be returned to Subscriber within sixty (60) days of termination of Spectrum's Service so long as payment has been made for all amounts due on Subscriber's account and Subscriber has returned the Equipment undamaged.
If Spectrum is holding a deposit on Subscriber’s account, Spectrum has the right to apply the deposited amount against any outstanding balance or shortfall in payments.</li>
<li>Advance Payment: Subscribers who are unable or unwilling to provide information to establish credit worthiness or who have an unsatisfactory credit rating may be required to make an advance payment.
The advance payment will be equal to the applicable installation charge and one month of recurring charges, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.
The advance payment will appear as a credit and be applied to the first monthly bill.
Spectrum reserves the right to refuse Service if the Subscriber fails to fulfill standard credit requirements.
After Service has been established, the Subscriber will be responsible for the payment of all applicable charges, including taxes, fees and surcharges to avoid discontinuance of Service.</li>

If Subscriber’s account thereafter remains unpaid, Subscriber’s Services may be suspended or disconnected.
Subscriber can avoid incurring late fees by paying Subscriber’s monthly bill promptly.
Any late fees assessed are not considered interest credit service charges, finance charges or penalties.
Spectrum expects that Subscriber will pay for Services on a timely basis, and Spectrum does not extend credit to customers.</li>
<li>Disclaimer: Spectrum assumes no liability for any program, services, content or information distributed on or through the Services and Spectrum expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for Subscriber’s use thereof.
Further, Spectrum shall not be responsible for any products, merchandise or prizes promoted or purchased through the use of the Services.</li>

When practical, Spectrum will provide notice that is reasonable under the circumstances before suspending or terminating Service to an existing Subscriber, and Spectrum will provide any prior notice of suspension or termination that is required by law.</li>
<li>Indemnification.
In requesting and accepting Spectrum Services, Subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Spectrum, including its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and authorized agents (individually and collectively, "Spectrum Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all demands, claims, suits, judgments, expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney or witness fees), loss, damages to, or destruction of personal, real, or intellectual property, bodily injury or death of any person, and other liabilities arising from:<ol>

<li>Any unauthorized, unlawful, or fraudulent use of or access to the Services, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.
and</li>
<li>Any infringement or invasion of the right of privacy of any person or persons, caused or claimed to have been caused, directly or indirectly, by the installation, operation, failure to operate, maintenance, removal, presence, condition, or use of the 911 or E-911 service features and the equipment associated therewith, or by the use of any Voice Services furnished by Spectrum in connection with the 911 or E-911 service, including but not limited to, the telephone number, address or name associated with the telephone used by persons accessing 911 or E-911 service thereunder, and/or that which arises out of the negligence or other wrongful act of (i) Subscriber, (ii) members of Subscriber’s household, (iii) Subscriber’s guests, or (ii) any other person using the Services provided to Subscriber.<br>
The foregoing defense and indemnity obligations exclude damages to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Spectrum Indemnitees.
Subscriber agrees that Spectrum Indemnitees are not liable for any damages or liability resulting from the loss of Services (whether Internet, Cable, Voice, or other Services), nor will Subscriber make any claims or undertake any actions against Spectrum Indemnitees for loss of Service.
Subscriber shall be solely responsible for any damage to or loss of Spectrum Equipment, unless such damage or loss is caused solely by the negligence or willful misconduct of Spectrum Indemnitees.</li>

</li>
<li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO ANY ACTS, OMISSIONS AND NEGLIGENCE OF SPECTRUM AND ITS THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS (AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS OR REPRESENTATIVES).<br>

SPECTRUM’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY BREACH BY SPECTRUM OF ANY OBLIGATION SPECTRUM MAY HAVE UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR APPLICABLE LAW, SHALL BE CUSTOMER’S ABILITY TO TERMINATE THE SERVICE OR TO OBTAIN THE REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF ANY DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BY SPECTRUM.

SUBSCRIBER ALSO AGREES THAT IT SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO BRING ANY CLAIM WHATSOEVER AGAINST SPECTRUM THAT RESULTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM SUBSCRIBER’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE GENERAL TERMS.<br>
THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THESE GENERAL TERMS.</li>
<li>Privacy Policy.
Spectrum will provide Subscriber with a copy of its customer privacy policy at the time Spectrum provides Service to Subscriber, and annually afterwards, or as otherwise required by law.
Subscriber can view the most current version of our privacy notice by going to "www.spectrum.com, and then "Your Privacy Rights." Subscriber assumes sole responsibility for all privacy, security and other risks associated with providing personally identifiable information to third parties via the Service.
To the extent that Spectrum is expressly required to do so by applicable law, Spectrum will provide notice to Subscriber of a breach of the security of certain personally identifiable information about Subscriber.
Subscriber agrees that Spectrum may collect and disclose information concerning Subscriber and Subscriber’s use of Service in the manner and for the purposes set forth herein and in Spectrum’s privacy policy.
In order to protect the privacy of Subscriber’s account information, Spectrum may require that Subscriber use a security code or other method, in addition to the user name and password, to confirm Subscriber’s identity when requesting or otherwise accessing account information or making changes to Subscriber’s Service through Spectrum’s customer service representatives.
Subscriber may also choose to designate an authorized user of Subscriber’s account (an "Authorized User"), who will be able to access Subscriber’s account information and make changes to Subscriber’s account.
Once established, an Authorized User may be required to authenticate his/her identity in the same manner according to Spectrum’s policies.</li>
<li>ARBITRATION.
The following provisions are important with respect to the agreement between Subscriber and Spectrum regarding Spectrum’s Services memorialized by these General Terms.<br>
PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT SUBSCRIBER UNDERSTANDS EACH PROVISION.
These General Terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes and otherwise limits the remedies available to Subscriber in the event of a dispute.<br>
Subject to the "Exclusions" paragraph below, Spectrum and Subscriber agree to arbitrate disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these General Terms, the Services, the Equipment, or marketing of the Services Subscriber has received from Spectrum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action on any matter or subject in small claims court.<br>
THESE GENERAL TERMS MEMORIALIZE A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE.THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.<br>
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of intent to arbitrate, entitled "Notice of Intent to Arbitrate" ("Notice").
The Notice to Spectrum should be addressed to: VP and Associate General Counsel, Litigation, Charter Communications, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St.
Louis, MO 63131 ("Arbitration Notice Address").
The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, Subscriber or Spectrum may commence an arbitration proceeding, in which all issues are for the arbitrator to decide (including the scope of the arbitration clause), but the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of these General Terms.<br>
The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these General Terms, and the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "www.adr.org," by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address.<br>
SPECTRUM SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ANY ARBITRATION FILING FEES AND ARBITRATOR’S FEES FOR CLAIMS OF UP TO $75,000.
SUBSCRIBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OTHER ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT SUBSCRIBER INCURS IN THE ARBITRATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS FEES OR EXPERT WITNESS COSTS UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED OF SPECTRUM UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
If the arbitrator’s award exceeds $75,000, either party may appeal such award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA and selected according to the AAA Rules, by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days after the date of entry of the arbitration award.
The appealing party must provide the other party with a copy of such appeal concurrently with its submission of the appeals notice to AAA.
The three-arbitrator panel must issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which may exist under the Federal Arbitration Act.<br>
The parties may agree that arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.<br>
SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, SUBSCRIBER AND SPECTRUM ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY<br>
Unless Spectrum and Subscriber agree otherwise in writing, all hearings conducted as part of the arbitration shall take place in the county (or parish) of Subscriber’s billing address.<br>
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking relief, only to the extent sought, and only to the extent necessary to provide the specific relief warranted by such individual’s claim.<br>
The parties agree that the arbitrator must give effect to the terms of these General Terms.<br>
SUBSCRIBER AND SPECTRUM AGREE THAT CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN SUBSCRIBER’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF, OR AS PART OF, A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING<br>
Furthermore, unless both Subscriber and Spectrum agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of these arbitration provisions shall be null and void and rendered of no further effect with respect to the specific claim at issue.<br>
Right to Opt Out.
If Subscriber does not wish to be bound by these arbitration provisions, Subscriber must notify Spectrum in writing within 30 days of (a) the date that this arbitration provision becomes effective, if Subscriber is an existing customer, or (b) the date that Subscriber first subscribes to the Service(s).
Subscriber may opt out by mail to the Arbitration Notice Address.
Subscriber’s written notification to Spectrum must include Subscriber’s name, address, and Spectrum account number as well as a clear statement that Subscriber does not wish to resolve disputes with Spectrum through arbitration.
Subscriber’s decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on Subscriber’s relationship with Spectrum or the delivery of Services to Subscriber by Spectrum.<br>
Severability.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect.<br>
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE EVENT SOME OR ALL OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IS DETERMINED TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT THAT IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY TRIAL BY JURY.<br>
For purposes of the foregoing sentence only, in the event such waiver is found to be unenforceable, it shall be severed from these General Terms, rendered null and void and of no further effect without affecting the rest of the arbitration provisions set forth herein.<br>
EXCLUSIONS.
SUBSCRIBER AND SPECTRUM AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS OR DISPUTES SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION:<br>

Subscriber must bring any claim against Spectrum within one (1) year after the date on which the claim arose or, unless applicable law provides that the normal statute of limitations for that claim may not be shortened by agreement.
If Subscriber does not bring a claim within this period, Subscriber waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights Subscriber has to such claim and Spectrum will have no liability with respect to such claim.<br>
Subscriber may opt out of this Section, in which case the normal statute of limitations will apply.

Spectrum’s right to contact Subscriber shall also survive these General Terms unless Subscriber opts out in the manner described in these General Terms.
All other obligations of Subscriber and Spectrum under these General Terms also survive termination if they relate to the period before termination or, if by their terms, they would be expected to survive such termination.</li>
<li>Entire Agreement: These General Terms (including the Terms of Service incorporated herein by reference) constitute the entire agreement between the Subscriber and Spectrum.
No undertaking, representation or warranty made by an agent or representative of Spectrum in connection with the sale, installation, maintenance or removal of Spectrum's Services or Equipment shall be binding on Spectrum except as expressly included herein.
Subscriber agrees that, if any portion of these General Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and if severed or rendered null and void thereby, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.
If Spectrum fails to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these General Terms, it does not thereby waive any provision or right.

Any user who does not agree to be bound by the Terms of Service should immediately stop their use of the Voice Service and notify Spectrum's Customer Service Department at 1-833-267-6095 to terminate the Voice Service.
Terms that are initially capitalized but not defined, will have the defined meaning given to them in the other documents referenced above.
This agreement (the "Agreement") is a binding legal document that may be amended unilaterally by Spectrum with or without notice to Subscriber.</p>
<p>Spectrum regularly updates and amends these Terms of Service.
Subscriber should consult Spectrum's website www.spectrum.com to be sure Subscriber remains in compliance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Services Provided: Spectrum Voice Service provides unlimited and/or measured calling within the United States and to those countries and US territories described in calling plans identified in the applicable Price Guide, in accordance with these terms and conditions.
Subscribers must reside in an area where Spectrum is authorized to provide Voice Service and where, in Spectrum's sole discretion, it is technically and operationally feasible.
Residential Voice Service is only intended for use by Subscriber, Subscriber's family and guests, and persons residing at Subscriber's residential premises, including persons temporarily subleasing Subscriber's residential premises.</li>
<li>Monthly Service Fee: Subscriber agrees to pay the monthly service charge for Spectrum Voice Service which is comprised of various fees and related taxes and surcharges.
Spectrum reserves the right to increase or decrease any fee for Voice Service offered.
Fees for Spectrum Voice Service shall be posted in the applicable Price Guide at www.spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." Spectrum Voice Service will be terminated in the event Subscriber does not pay.
Certain fees for Spectrum Voice Service are based upon periodic studies that analyze the intrastate, interstate and international minutes of all customers purchasing Voice Service.</li>
<li>Voice Service Features: Spectrum Voice Service is offered with the features below.
In certain areas, Spectrum also offers a mobile application, "Phone2Go," that allows Subscribers to use their Voice Service away from their residence with access to suitable WiFi connectivity.
Certain features may not be available with the Phone2Go mobile application, or may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented within the Phone2Go mobile application.<ol>
<li>Calling and Features: Includes local, regional and/or long distance calling within the United States and to those countries and US territories described in calling plans identified in the applicable Price Guide, along with those calling features pertaining to each calling plan.
Feature availability may vary by service area.
A detailed list of features and calling plans may be found in the Price Guide at www.spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." Direct dialed calls outside the coverage of any calling plan are available with per-minute charges or with one of Spectrum's International calling plans.
Existing Subscribers who may purchase a plan other than a plan described in this Agreement, can find a description of their plan in the Price Guide.</li>
<li>E-911: Enhanced 911 ("E-911") is a feature of Spectrum Voice Service that allows emergency operators to automatically receive the telephone number and address of the dialing party.
This E-911 feature has certain requirements in order to operate, as well as certain limitations:<ol>
<li>IMPORTANT: The emergency service provider handling the E-911 call, and the address the emergency service provider will see, are linked to the service address Spectrum has on file when Subscriber originally signed up for service.
If Subscriber does not correctly identify where Subscriber's voice modem is actually located, or if the voice modem is moved away from the original service address, Subscriber's E-911 calls may be misdirected to the wrong location(s) or to the wrong emergency service provider(s).
Therefore, in order to have E-911 calls routed correctly, Subscriber agrees not to move the voice modem from the service address at which it was installed by Spectrum and acknowledges responsibility to promptly notify Spectrum of any change in service address prior to moving the voice modem.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Keeping Your Phone Number: Please be aware that during the first 72 hours of arriving at Subscriber's new service address, if Subscriber dials 911 from their Spectrum Voice Service, Subscriber must relay to the emergency service operator the new (current) service address.
This is necessary to ensure emergency services are dispatched to Subscriber's new service address and not the old service address in the event the emergency services operator may not have the new location in their records.</li>
<li>Spectrum Voice Service does not have its own power supply.
If there is a power outage, or if there is a disruption to the cable network or facilities, the Voice Service will not work.
Subscriber expressly acknowledges that in such cases it will not be possible to place or receive calls including calls to access emergency 911 services.</li>
<li>If Subscriber chooses, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with the voice modem by calling Spectrum at 1-833-267-6095.
Each battery backup is designed to provide power for up to 8 hours (or 5 hours of "talk" time) for a power outage at Subscriber's residence that is not also a network-related outage.</li>
<li>In some locations, E-911 service may not yet be available.
Such services are dependent on the equipment and facilities of the local governments in which Spectrum provides Voice Service.
In such cases, regular 911 service will be available and Subscriber will need to convey the location information to the emergency operator.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Number of Lines: Subscribers to Spectrum Voice Service can purchase up to two (2) lines at their service address.</li>
<li>Installation: Spectrum Voice Service offers professional installation and self-installation (not available in all areas).<ol>
<li>Professional installation includes activation of all existing working phone jacks or the installation and activation of one phone jack if there is not currently a working phone jack in Subscriber's residence.
Additional wiring charges may apply if Subscriber requests additional jacks to be installed or activated.
Additional charges may also apply for special construction needed to complete the installation.
Spectrum also provides and installs a voice modem, or Multimedia Terminal Adaptor (MTA), that is used to communicate with our private communications network.</li>
<li>Self-installation (not available in all areas) provides the option for the Subscriber to pick-up a voice modem or MTA from a Spectrum retail location or have that equipment shipped to their home.
Upon receipt of the equipment, the Subscriber must follow self-installation instructions provided by Spectrum.
In order to qualify for self-installation the following installation conditions must be met: • Subscriber’s home’s phone system must consist of a base unit with any additional cordless phones supported by the base unit.
• Subscriber’s alarm, security and fax systems must not be dependent on Spectrum Voice Service.
• Subscriber’s most recent voice provider was Spectrum, or Subscriber has had active Spectrum services in the last 2 years.
and • Subscriber will not need outlets moved or added.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>Spectrum does not provide a handset.
Subscriber is responsible for maintaining all inside wire and phones within the home.
Subscriber has the option of Spectrum's Wire Maintenance Insurance that may help avoid costly repair charges.
For a low monthly fee, we can provide repair service for Subscriber’s jacks and inside wiring.
(The wiring must meet certified technical standards.) Wire maintenance is included in some bundles.
For more information about Wire Maintenance Insurance, go online to Spectrum's Wire Maintenance plan information at www.spectrum.net/wiremaintenance.
In certain buildings such as multiple dwelling units, Spectrum's technicians may not have access to Subscriber's inside wiring located within the multiple dwelling unit.
In these instances, Spectrum has the right to determine how best to wire Subscriber's residence, subject to additional applicable charges.</p>
<li>International Calling: Spectrum Voice Service offers a per minute calling plan for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses to use this service Subscriber will be charged for direct-dial international calls in addition to the flat monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Spectrum Voice Service.
Spectrum Voice Service also offers optional flat rate international calling plans for direct-dialed calls made from Subscriber's residence to locations outside of their calling plan.
If Subscriber chooses an international plan, Subscriber will be charged a flat monthly fee for direct-dial international calls in addition to the monthly recurring rate that Subscriber pays for Voice Service.
After Subscriber’s monthly international calling plan minutes are used, unless Subscriber’s plan includes unlimited international calling, each additional minute will be charged at a per-minute rate.
For both per-minute international calling and international calling plans, calls are measured in increments of one minute.
All calls which are a fraction of a minute are rounded up to the next whole minute.
Timing on completed calls begins when the call is answered by the called party.
Answering is determined when call signaling provided by the terminating local carrier, and/or any intermediate carrier(s), so indicate.
Timing terminates on all calls when the calling party hangs up or when Spectrum's network receives a termination signal from the terminating local carrier and/or any intermediate carrier(s).
Unused minutes per month do not roll over to the next month.
You may access international rates and information about international calling plans online at www.spectrum.net/rates.</li>
<li>Voice Service Modifications: Spectrum may, from time to time, offer additional Voice Service features or functionality, or discontinue certain Voice Service features or functionality.
Information about these features or functions will be available in the applicable Price Guide at www.Spectrum.com, under "Terms of Service/Policies." These additional Voice Services features or functions may be subject to additional specific terms and conditions, and may be subject to change at any time by Spectrum.</li>
<li>Caller Name: Spectrum Voice Service will associate Subscriber's name on the Spectrum account to the telephone number to be displayed in association with the caller name lookup services ("CNAM") provided as part of the Voice Service for all calls made from any of the Spectrum telephone numbers on the account.
In the event that Subscriber wishes to modify the caller name associated with the CNAM, Subscriber agrees to the following: caller name submission(s) shall not mislead or impersonate any person or company.
caller name submission(s) shall not contain false information and shall accurately represent the name of the person that subscribes to the Voice Service and that is included in directory listings, if any.
caller name submission(s) shall not contain abusive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, racist or any other language objectionable to any person or entity as determined by Spectrum, in its sole discretion.
and caller name submission(s) shall comply with all relevant laws, rules and regulations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>4.
Voice Service Limitations:<ol>
<li>Service Outages: The Spectrum Voice Service modem is electrically powered and will not work in a power outage or if the broadband connection is disrupted or not operating.
In the event of power outages, the modem, including all phones and Voice Services connected to or powered by it, will not work.
Power outages will disrupt E-911 service and the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between a home security system and central monitoring services.
To reduce this risk, Subscriber may choose to purchase a battery backup for use in the event of a non-network related outage.</li>
<li>Home Security Systems: Although Spectrum Voice Service will supply a connection that will allow the operation of Subscriber's existing home security system, Spectrum does not guarantee that any such system will be in complete operational order following the installation of the Voice Service.
As such, it is Subscriber's obligation to contact their home security system provider to inform them of Spectrum Voice Service installation, and any change in phone number, and to request a complete operational test of their system immediately following installation of the Voice Service.
In addition, it is Subscriber's responsibility to test their system on a regular basis.
In the event of a power outage or network outage (whether unplanned or maintenance related), Subscriber’s Voice Service, including any home security system which uses the Voice Service to connect to central station monitoring, will not function.
As set forth in Section 3(b)(iv) above, Subscriber may separately purchase a battery backup for use with their voice modem in the instance of a non-network related outage.<br>
Like any other communications service provider, we do not represent that our service is fail-safe.
In addition, Spectrum prohibits the use of Spectrum Voice Service as the connection between medical alert systems and a central station monitoring service, and will neither connect to such services nor provide technical support for the connection.</li>
<li>Additional Limitations:<ol>
<li>Currently, certain operator-assisted services such as busy line verification and busy line interruption, dial around services (10-10-XXX), pay services (900 and 976 services), and third-party billing are not offered with Voice Service.</li>
<li>If Subscriber receives Voicemail, Subscriber may be eligible for voice-to-text or voice-to-email ("Readable Voicemail") as part of the Voicemail feature.
As a result of the voice-recognition software used by Spectrum, some processed messages may not be fully transcribed and will appear as incomplete messages.
In such cases, Subscriber may obtain the full message by listening to the Readable Voicemail message.
As a condition of using the voice-to-text or voice-to-email feature, Subscriber consents to allow Spectrum, or its service vendors, to process those voice files and to use voicemail messages, and other data associated with such messages, to enhance and/or improve the feature.</li>
<li>Spectrum's obligation to furnish Voice Services is dependent upon its ability to secure and retain, without unreasonable expense, suitable facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance of the necessary facilities and equipment.
Spectrum may limit communications, refuse to provide Voice Services or discontinue Voice Services when necessary because of: (i) the lack of transmission medium, transmission capacity or any other facilities or equipment.
(ii) the lack of available services from, or interconnection with, the services or facilities of service providers.
or (iii) any cause beyond Spectrum's control.</li>
<li>Spectrum shall use reasonable efforts to make Voice Services available by the estimated service date.
Spectrum shall not be liable for any damages resulting from delays in meeting the estimated service date due to delays resulting from normal installation procedures.
Such delays shall include, but not be limited to, delays in obtaining right-of-way approvals, delays in actual construction work being done by Spectrum, including its contractors or representatives, and any delays due to any other service provider where Spectrum is relying upon such provider to meet an estimated due date which is beyond Spectrum's control.</li>
<li>Spectrum offers the use of its facilities for communications between Subscriber and other parties.
Spectrum is not responsible, and shall have no liability, for any communications or miscommunications between Subscriber (including any users) and other parties (including operator-assisted, 911 and E-911 calls).</li>
<li>At Spectrum's discretion, facilities of other service providers may be used in establishing connections to points not reached by Spectrum's facilities.
In establishing connections with other providers, Spectrum is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of other service providers.</li>
<li>The Phone2Go mobile application is provided by Spectrum for use only by Spectrum residential Voice Service customers, and only in certain areas.
Certain features of Spectrum’s Voice Service may not be available with the Phone2Go application, and certain features available within the Phone2Go application may be subject to additional terms and conditions as presented within the Phone2Go application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Equipment: Spectrum Voice Service requires a voice modem.
Spectrum will supply a voice modem for so long as Subscriber remains a Voice Service Subscriber or until Spectrum changes its Voice Service offering.
Depending on the Spectrum Voice Service plan, there may be a monthly charge for the voice modem.
Upon termination of Spectrum Voice Service for any reason, Subscriber may be asked to return the Spectrum-supplied voice modem within thirty (30) days or Subscriber will be charged an equipment fee equal to the fee charged by Spectrum at the time the voice modem was supplied by Spectrum.
An exception to this return policy is when the modem is also supporting Internet service, in which case Subscriber may continue to use the modem until such time as Internet is no longer provided or Spectrum requests a substitution of the modem.
Equipment and facilities furnished by Spectrum to provide Voice Service (except for inside wiring and inside jacks) are the property of Spectrum.
Telephone numbers assigned to Subscriber by Spectrum are portable and transferable with Subscriber at the same location.
however, Subscriber has no property right in telephone number(s) or any other call number designations associated with the Voice Services, and Spectrum may change such numbers as deemed necessary.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Term: Spectrum Voice Service shall continue until such time as terminated by Subscriber, which shall be effective upon notice, or terminated by Spectrum for breach (including nonpayment) of this Agreement, or otherwise terminated by Spectrum in accordance with the Terms of Service.</li>
<li>Directory Listing: Spectrum Voice Service offers Subscriber a Private Number service as the default, or a directory listing upon request.
Depending on the location and Subscriber’s preference, Spectrum Voice Service may include one (1) basic directory listing in an alphabetical white pages directory, or other comparable online directory, containing an alphabetical list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of all telephone customers in a particular geographic area set by the publisher.
The alphabetical list of customer names is for the purpose of informing interested parties of the telephone number and address of listed customers, and special position or arrangement of names may be provided for an additional charge.
Listings shall conform to the publisher's practices with respect to published directories.
Spectrum limits the length of any listing in the directory by the use of abbreviations when, in Spectrum's opinion, the clarity of the listing or the identification of the customer is not impaired by doing so.
The duration of directory listings, when the listings have been published, is the directory period.
The directory period is from the day on which the directory is first distributed to customers to the day the succeeding directory is first distributed to customers.
Spectrum's liability for directory listing errors or omissions is set out in Section 7, "Limitation of Liability."</li>
<li>Limitation of Liability:<ol>

<p>Política De Uso Aceptable De Spectrum Internet</p> POLÍTICA DE USO ACEPTABLE DE SPECTRUM INTERNET
<p>Para poder proporcionar un servicio al cliente de primera calidad y garantizar la integridad, seguridad y confiabilidad de la Red de Internet de Charter Communications Operating, LLC y sus respectivas afiliadas y subsidiarias que proporcionan servicios ("Spectrum"), Spectrum ha creado esta Política de uso aceptable (AUP).
Esta AUP se aplica junto con los Términos y condiciones del servicio que rigen el uso por parte del Abonado del servicio de Internet de Spectrum y otros relacionados (en conjunto, las "Condiciones del servicio"), la Política de privacidad de Spectrum y la Declaración sobre las prácticas de administración de la red de Spectrum, para especificar las restricciones de uso y los requisitos aplicables a los usuarios del Servicio.
El Abonado reconoce y acepta que la versión actual de la AUP establecida por Spectrum y publicada en el sitio web de Spectrum suplantará todas las versiones anteriores de este documento y que el uso continuo por parte del Abonado del servicio de Internet de Spectrum implica que el Abonado acepta esta política así como sus futuras enmiendas.</p>
<p>Al utilizar este Servicio, el Abonado acepta acatar, y requerir que cada usuario del Servicio acate, las condiciones de esta AUP y las Condiciones del servicio asociadas.
Cualquier usuario que no acepte quedar sujeto a estas condiciones debe cesar de inmediato su uso del Servicio y notificar al departamento de Servicio al Cliente de Spectrum que cancele la cuenta.</p>

Algunos ejemplos de abuso de recursos incluyen, a título enunciativo: servidores abiertos de noticias, servidores SMTP abiertos, enrutadores inalámbricos no seguros y servidores proxy no seguros.
En el caso de que el Abonado esté utilizando un enrutador inalámbrico, Spectrum requiere que cualquier red móvil sea segura y esté codificada.
Las redes móviles abiertas no codificadas quedan estrictamente prohibidas.
Si surgiese alguna dificultad, el Abonado debe abordar el problema en el momento adecuado.
Si no se solucionara el problema después de la correspondiente notificación, esto será considerado como una violación de esta AUP.</li>
<li>Administración de la red.
Spectrum utiliza una gran variedad de herramientas y prácticas razonables para la administración de la red en conformidad con las normas de la industria.
En el caso de que los períodos de congestión requieran dicha administración, Spectrum cuenta con las siguientes herramientas y prácticas (sin limitaciones y según se puedan modificar con el paso del tiempo): (i) la tecnología de Administración de tráfico de abonados (STM) para reducir temporalmente la prioridad de tráfico con el mayor impacto en el momento de máxima congestión.
(ii) filtración de correo no deseado y técnicas de detección.
y (iii) medidas para proteger la seguridad o integridad de su red, sus recursos y sus abonados (por ejemplo, servicios de reputación de IP desde múltiples fuentes para rechazar la retransmisión de correo a IP sospechosas fuera del entorno de Charter, listas de bloqueo de IP en tiempo real para determinar si aceptar o no una conexión a servidores de correo entrante, técnicas de seguridad de puertos, como la codificación y autenticación, y monitoreo de tráfico de servidor a servidor de e-mail).
En ciertos casos, si se emplean estas técnicas, esto puede afectar la velocidad de rendimiento con la cual los abonados pueden enviar y recibir datos, tener un impacto en la capacidad de los usuarios para establecer conexiones de sesión dentro de la red o causar una demora en el tráfico durante los momentos de máxima congestión.
Para obtener más información acerca de las prácticas y políticas de administración de la red de Spectrum, consulte la Declaración sobre las Prácticas de Administración de la Red de Spectrum</li>
<li>Virus.
Los usuarios deben tomar las medidas apropiadas para evitar que sus sistemas se infecten con y/o distribuyan virus informáticos, incluidos, a título enunciativo, gusanos, "troyanos", ataques por denegación de servicio y bots.
Spectrum tomará las medidas apropiadas (según el criterio exclusivo de Spectrum) contra los Usuarios infectados con virus informáticos o gusanos a fin de evitar que se extiendan aún más.</li>
<li>Implementación de medidas.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho a investigar las violaciones de esta AUP, incluidas la recopilación de información del Abonado u otros Usuarios involucrados y la parte denunciante, si la hubiera, y la examinación del material en los servidores y la red de Spectrum.
Spectrum prefiere notificar a los Usuarios acerca de las violaciones de la AUP y de cualquier acción correctiva necesaria, pero si Spectrum, a su entera discreción, determina que un Usuario ha violado la AUP, tomará cualquier medida de respuesta que considere apropiada sin previo aviso.
Dichas medidas incluyen, a título enunciativo: la suspensión temporal del servicio, una reducción de los recursos del servicio y la cancelación del servicio.
Spectrum no se responsabiliza por ninguna acción de respuesta y dichas acciones no son exclusivas.
Spectrum puede tomar cualquier otra medida legal o técnica que considere apropiada.</li>

Si Spectrum o sus afiliadas no ejecutan alguna disposición de esta Política en cualquier momento dado, esto no deberá ser interpretado como una renuncia a ningún derecho a hacerlo en el futuro.</li>

El uso continuado del Servicio se considerará como el reconocimiento y la aceptación de esta Política.

<li>ARBITRAJE.
Las siguientes disposiciones son importantes con respecto al acuerdo entre el Abonado y Spectrum, en relación con los Servicios de Spectrum resumidos en estos Términos generales.<br>
LÉALAS DETENIDAMENTE PARA ASEGURARSE DE QUE EL ABONADO COMPRENDE CADA UNA DE LAS DISPOSICIONES.
Estos Términos generales requieren el uso de arbitraje para resolver disputas y limita de otro modo las compensaciones disponibles para el Abonado en el caso de una disputa.<br>
Sujetos a las "Exclusiones" del párrafo siguiente, Spectrum y el Abonado acceden a arbitrar las disputas y reclamaciones derivadas de o relacionadas con estos Términos generales, los Servicios, el Equipo o la comercialización de los Servicios que el Abonado recibió de Spectrum.
No obstante lo anterior, cada parte puede tomar una acción individual sobre cualquier asunto o materia ante el tribunal de reclamaciones menores.<br>
ESTOS TÉRMINOS GENERALES CONSTATAN POR ESCRITO UNA TRANSACCIÓN DE COMERCIO INTERESTATAL.
LA LEY DE ARBITRAJE FEDERAL RIGE LA INTERPRETACIÓN Y LA APLICACIÓN DE ESTAS DISPOSICIONES DE ARBITRAJE.<br>
La parte que intente buscar arbitraje primero debe enviar a la otra una notificación por escrito de su intención de arbitraje, con el título "Aviso de Intención de Arbitraje" ("Aviso").
El Aviso a Spectrum deberá dirigirse a la siguiente dirección: VP and Associate General Counsel, Litigation, Charter Communications, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St.
Louis, MO 63131 ("Dirección de Aviso de Arbitraje").
El Aviso debe: (1) describir la naturaleza y la base de la reclamación o disputa.
y (ii) establecer la reparación específica deseada.
Si no llegamos a un acuerdo para resolver la reclamación en el plazo de los 30 días posteriores a la recepción del Aviso, el Abonado o Spectrum pueden iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje, en el cual todos los problemas los dirimirá un árbitro (incluido el alcance de la cláusula de arbitraje), pero el árbitro debe estar vinculado a los términos de estos Términos generales.<br>
El arbitraje estará regido por las normas de arbitraje comercial y los procedimientos suplementarios para disputas relacionadas con clientes (colectivamente, "Normas AAA") de la American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), según modificadas por estos Términos generales, y el arbitraje será administrado por la AAA.
Las Normas AAA y la información sobre los cargos están disponibles en "www.adr.org".
También podrá obtenerlas si llama al teléfono 1-800-778-7879 o si escribe a la Dirección de Aviso de Arbitraje.<br>
SPECTRUM ASUMIRÁ LOS COSTOS DE CUALQUIER CARGO ADMINISTRATIVO POR ARBITRAJE Y LOS HONORARIOS DEL ÁRBITRO PARA RECLAMACIONES DE HASTA $75,000.
EL ABONADO ES RESPONSABLE DE LOS COSTOS ADICIONALES EN QUE SE PUEDA INCURRIR EN EL ARBITRAJE, INCLUYENDO, AUNQUE NO EXCLUSIVAMENTE, HONORARIOS DE ABOGADOS O COSTOS DE TESTIGOS EXPERTOS, A MENOS QUE LA LEGISLACIÓN CORRESPONDIENTE RESPONSABILICE A SPECTRUM.<br>
Si el laudo arbitral supera los $75,000, cada parte puede apelar dicha sentencia a un panel de tres árbitros administrado por la AAA y seleccionado según las normas de la AAA, presentando una apelación por escrito en el plazo de 30 días posteriores a la fecha del laudo de arbitraje.
La parte que apele debe ofrecer a la otra parte una copia de dicha apelación, junto con el envío del aviso de apelación a la AAA.
El panel de tres árbitros debe emitir una decisión en un plazo de 120 días a partir de la fecha del aviso de apelación de la parte apelante.
La decisión del panel de tres árbitros será definitiva y vinculante, excepto cuando exista algún derecho de apelación al amparo de la Ley de Arbitraje Federal.<br>
Las partes pueden optar por un arbitraje realizado únicamente en función de los documentos enviados al árbitro, por audiencia telefónica, o por audiencia en persona tal y como lo establecen las normas de la AAA.<br>
EL ABONADO ACEPTA QUE, AL SUSCRIBIR ESTE ACUERDO, TANTO EL ABONADO COMO SPECTRUM RENUNCIAN AL DERECHO DE UN JUICIO CON JURADO.<br>
Salvo que Spectrum y el Abonado lo acuerden de otro modo por escrito, todas las audiencias celebradas como parte del arbitraje tendrán lugar en el condado (o distrito) de la dirección de facturación del Abonado.<br>
El árbitro puede conceder medidas cautelares solamente en favor de la parte que busca reparación y solo hasta el límite necesario para ofrecer la reparación específica garantizada por la reclamación de dicho individuo.<br>
Las partes acuerdan que el árbitro debe hacer efectivos los términos de estos Términos generales.<br>
EL ABONADO Y SPECTRUM ACUERDAN QUE LAS RECLAMACIONES SOLO PUEDEN PRESENTARSE A TÍTULO INDIVIDUAL DEL ABONADO, Y NO EN NOMBRE DE, O COMO PARTE DE, UNA ACCIÓN COLECTIVA O PROCEDIMIENTO REPRESENTATIVO.<br>
Además, a menos que el Abonado y Spectrum lo acuerden de otro modo por escrito, el árbitro no puede consolidar los procedimientos o las reclamaciones de más de una persona y no puede presidir ninguna otra forma de procedimiento representativo o colectivo.
Si este párrafo específico no se puede aplicar, entonces la totalidad de estas disposiciones de arbitraje se declararán nulas, sin validez y sin efecto con respecto a la reclamación específica objeto del problema.<br>

<p>Acuerdo Del Servicio De Voz Residencial Spectrum</p> ACUERDO DEL SERVICIO DE VOZ RESIDENCIAL SPECTRUM
<p>ESTOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES DE SERVICIO QUE CUBREN SU USO DEL SERVICIO SPECTRUM VOICE INCLUYEN UNA CLÁUSULA DE ARBITRAJE VINCULANTE EN LOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES GENERALES PARA LOS SERVICIOS RESIDENCIALES DE SPECTRUM, QUE INCLUYE UNA RENUNCIA DE ACCIONES Y CLÁUSULAS COLECTIVAS PARA LA EXCLUSIÓN DEL ARBITRAJE.</p>
<p>Charter Communications Operating, LLC., a través de sus afiliadas para el servicio de voz, ("Spectrum") se complace en proporcionarle su Servicio de voz residencial a usted ("Abonado") según estos términos y condiciones que incorporan e incluyen los Términos y condiciones generales para los Servicios residenciales de Spectrum, la Guía de precios del Servicio Spectrum Voice residencial y la Política de privacidad de Spectrum, ya que pueden cambiar ocasionalmente (en conjunto, "Condiciones del servicio"), que pueden encontrarse en www.spectrum.com, como "Condiciones del servicio/Políticas" y "Política de privacidad".</p>
<p>El uso del servicio Spectrum Voice™ por parte del Abonado (también denominado "Servicio de voz") será considerado como la confirmación de que el Abonado ha leído y acepta las Condiciones del servicio.
El Abonado debe activar todos los Servicios Spectrum Voice que haya ordenado.
Spectrum no tendrá ningún tipo de responsabilidad si el Abonado no activa dichos Servicios.
El cliente que no acepte las Condiciones del servicio debe dejar de usar el Servicio de voz inmediatamente y notificar al Departamento de Servicio al Cliente de Spectrum al 1-833-267-6095, para cancelar el Servicio de voz.
Los términos que aparecen con mayúscula inicial pero sin definición, serán definidos en los otros documentos que se detallaron arriba.
Este acuerdo (el "Acuerdo") es un documento legal vinculante que Spectrum puede enmendar de manera unilateral con o sin previo aviso al Abonado.</p>
<p>Spectrum actualiza y modifica con regularidad estas Condiciones del servicio.
El Abonado debería consultar el sitio web de Spectrum en www.spectrum.com para asegurarse de seguir cumpliendo los términos y condiciones.</p>
<ol>
<li>Servicios proporcionados: el Servicio Spectrum Voice proporciona llamadas ilimitadas y/o medidas dentro de los Estados Unidos y a aquellos países y territorios estadounidenses descritos en los planes de llamadas identificados en la Guía de precios, de conformidad con estos términos y condiciones.
Los Abonados deben residir en un área donde Charter esté autorizado a proporcionar el Servicio de voz y donde, a exclusivo criterio de Spectrum, sea técnica y operativamente factible.
El Servicio de voz residencial está destinado al uso exclusivo por parte del Abonado, la familia y huéspedes del Abonado y toda persona alojada en la residencia del Abonado, incluso las personas que subalquilan la propiedad residencial del Abonado.</li>
<li>Cargo mensual por servicio: el Abonado acepta pagar el cargo mensual por el Servicio Spectrum Voice, el cual está compuesto por diversas tarifas así como por impuestos y recargos relacionados.
Spectrum se reserva el derecho de aumentar o reducir cualquier cargo por el Servicio de voz ofrecido.
Los cargos por el Servicio Spectrum Voice deben publicarse en la Guía de precios correspondiente en www.spectrum.com, en "Condiciones del servicio/Políticas".
El Servicio Spectrum Voice se cancelará en el caso de que el Abonado no pague.
Ciertos cargos por el servicio Spectrum Voice se basan en estudios periódicos que analizan los minutos intraestatales, interestatales e internacionales de todos los clientes que compran un Servicio de voz.</li>
<li>Funciones del Servicio de voz: el Servicio Spectrum Voice se ofrece con las funciones que se detallan a continuación.
En ciertas áreas, Spectrum también ofrece una aplicación móvil, "Phone2Go", que permite a los Abonados utilizar su Servicio de voz lejos de su residencia con acceso a conectividad Wi-Fi apta.
Es posible que ciertas funciones no estén disponibles con la aplicación móvil Phone2Go o estén sujetas a términos y condiciones adicionales presentados dentro de la aplicación móvil Phone2Go.<ol>
<li>Llamadas y funciones: incluye llamadas locales, regionales y/o de larga distancia dentro de los Estados Unidos y a aquellos países y territorios de los EE.
UU.
descritos en los planes de llamadas identificados en la Guía de precios correspondiente, junto con las funciones de llamadas relativas a cada plan.
La disponibilidad de las funciones puede variar según el área de servicio.
Se puede encontrar una lista detallada de las funciones y los planes de llamadas en la Guía de precios en www.spectrum.com, dentro de la sección "Condiciones del servicio/Políticas".
Las llamadas de marcado directo fuera de la cobertura de cualquier plan de llamadas están disponibles con cargos por minuto o con uno de los planes de llamadas internacionales de Spectrum.
Los Abonados existentes que puedan comprar un plan que no sea el descrito en este Acuerdo pueden encontrar una descripción de su plan en la Guía de precios.</li>
<li>E-911: el servicio 911 mejorado ("E-911") es una función del Servicio Spectrum Voice que permite a los operadores de emergencia recibir automáticamente el número de teléfono y la dirección de la persona que llama.
La función E-911 posee ciertos requisitos para que funcione, así como ciertas limitaciones:&lt;<ol>
<li>IMPORTANTE: el proveedor del servicio de emergencia que atiende la llamada E-911, y la dirección que este proveedor verá, está vinculada a la dirección de servicio que Spectrum mantiene en un registro habilitado cuando el Abonado firma inicialmente el contrato de servicio.
Si el Abonado no identifica correctamente el sitio donde se encuentra ubicado el módem para el servicio de voz del Abonado, o si el módem fue trasladado fuera de la dirección de servicio original, es posible que las llamadas E-911 del Abonado se dirijan erróneamente a la ubicación equivocada o al proveedor de servicios de emergencia incorrecto.
Por lo tanto, para que las llamadas al E-911 sigan el curso correcto, el Abonado acepta no trasladar el módem del servicio de voz de la dirección de servicio en la que fue instalado por Spectrum y acepta la responsabilidad de notificar a Spectrum de inmediato acerca de cualquier cambio en la dirección del servicio antes de trasladar el módem del servicio de voz del lugar.</li>
<li>IMPORTANTE: mantener su número de teléfono: tenga presente que durante las primeras 72 horas de llegada a la nueva dirección de servicio del Abonado, si este marca el 911 desde su Servicio Spectrum Voice, el Abonado debe informar al operador del servicio de emergencia la nueva (actual) dirección de servicio.
Esto es necesario para asegurar que los servicios de emergencia se dirijan a la nueva dirección de servicio del Abonado y no a la dirección de servicio anterior en caso de que un operador de servicios de emergencia no tenga la nueva dirección de servicio en sus registros.</li>
<li>El Servicio Spectrum Voice no tiene su propio suministro de energía.
Si hay un corte de energía o una interrupción del servicio de cable, el Servicio de voz no funcionará.
El Abonado reconoce expresamente que en tales casos no será posible realizar o recibir llamadas, incluso las llamadas al 911 para acceder a los servicios de emergencia.</li>
<li>Si el Abonado lo desea, con solo llamar a Spectrum al 1-833-267-6095, puede comprar, por separado, una batería de respaldo para utilizar el módem de voz.
Cada batería de respaldo está diseñada para proporcionar energía por hasta 8 horas (o 5 horas de tiempo de "conversación") en caso de corte de energía en la residencia del Abonado que no esté relacionado con la red.</li>
<li>Es posible que en algunas ubicaciones el servicio E-911 aún no esté disponible.
Dichos servicios dependen del equipo y las instalaciones del gobierno local en los que Spectrum proporciona el Servicio de voz.
En estos casos, el servicio normal del 911 estará disponible y el Abonado deberá comunicar la información de ubicación al operador de emergencia.</li>
<li>Cantidad de líneas: los Abonados del Servicio Spectrum Voice pueden comprar hasta dos (2) líneas en su dirección de servicio.</li>
<li>Instalación: El Servicio Spectrum Voice ofrece instalación profesional y autoinstalación (no disponible en todas las áreas).&lt;<ol>
<li>La instalación profesional incluye activación de todas las tomas telefónicas existentes o la instalación y activación de una toma telefónica si no hay ninguna en funcionamiento en la residencia del Abonado.
Se pueden aplicar cargos adicionales por cableado si el Abonado solicita la instalación o activación de tomas adicionales.
Los cargos adicionales también se pueden aplicar por trabajos de construcción especiales necesarios para completar la instalación.
Spectrum también proporciona e instala un módem de servicio de voz o adaptador para terminal de multimedia (MTA), que se usa para comunicarse con nuestra red de comunicación privada.</li>
<li>La autoinstalación (no disponible en todas las áreas) proporciona la opción de que el Abonado retire un módem de voz o un MTA de una tienda minorista de Spectrum o solicite que dicho equipo se le envíe a su hogar.
Al recibir el equipo, el Abonado debe seguir las instrucciones de autoinstalación proporcionadas por Spectrum.
Para ser elegible para la autoinstalación, es necesario cumplir con las siguientes condiciones de instalación: • El sistema telefónico del hogar del Abonado debe consistir en una unidad base con cualquier teléfono inalámbrico adicional compatible con dicha unidad.
• Los sistemas de alarma, seguridad y fax del Abonado no deben depender del Servicio Spectrum Voice.
• El proveedor de servicio de voz más reciente del Abonado era Spectrum o el Abonado ha tenido servicios Spectrum activos durante los últimos 2 años.
y • El Abonado no tendrá que trasladar ni agregar salidas.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>Spectrum no proporciona el aparato.
El Abonado es responsable del mantenimiento de todo el cableado interno y los teléfonos de su casa.
El Abonado tiene la opción de elegir el Seguro de mantenimiento de cableado de Spectrum que puede ayudar a evitar costosos cargos de reparación.
Por una tarifa mensual baja, podemos proporcionar el servicio de reparación para las tomas y el cableado interno del Abonado.
(El cableado debe cumplir con estándares técnicos certificados).
Algunos paquetes incluyen el mantenimiento del cableado.
Para obtener más información acerca del Seguro de mantenimiento de cableado, consulte la información del plan Mantenimiento de cableado de Spectrum en www.spectrum.net/wiremaintenance.
En ciertas edificaciones, como las unidades de múltiples viviendas, es posible que los técnicos de Spectrum no tengan acceso al cableado interno de la residencia del Abonado.
En estos casos, Spectrum tiene derecho de determinar la mejor manera de hacer el cableado de la residencia del Abonado, sujeto a los correspondientes cargos adicionales.</p>
<li>Llamadas internacionales: el Servicio Spectrum Voice ofrece un plan de llamadas por minuto para llamadas de marcado directo realizadas desde la residencia del Abonado a ubicaciones fuera de su plan de llamadas.
Si el Abonado decide utilizar este servicio, se le cobrará por las llamadas internacionales de marcado directo de forma adicional a la tarifa fija mensual recurrente que el Abonado paga por el Servicio Spectrum Voice.
El Servicio Spectrum Voice también ofrece planes opcionales de llamadas internacionales con tarifa plana para llamadas de marcado directo realizadas desde la residencia del Abonado a ubicaciones fuera de su plan de llamadas.
Si el Abonado elige un plan internacional, se le cobrará un cargo mensual fijo por llamadas internacionales de marcado directo además de la tarifa mensual recurrente que el Abonado paga por el Servicio de voz.
Una vez que el Abonado use los minutos de su plan mensual de llamadas internacionales, a menos que el plan del Abonado incluya llamadas internacionales ilimitadas, se le cobrará una tarifa por cada minuto adicional.
Tanto para el plan de llamadas internacionales por minuto como para el plan de llamadas internacionales, las llamadas se miden por minuto.
Todas las llamadas menores de un minuto se redondearán al próximo minuto completo.
El tiempo de llamadas completadas comienza a contar desde el momento en que responden la llamada.
La contestación de la llamada se determina cuando lo determina la señal de llamada proporcionada por el proveedor local y/o cualquier otro proveedor intermediario.
La duración de todas las llamadas finaliza cuando la persona que llama corta la llamada, o cuando la red de Spectrum recibe la señal de finalización de llamada por parte del proveedor local y/o cualquier proveedor intermediario.
Los minutos que no se usaron en el mes no pasan al mes siguiente.
Se puede tener acceso a las tarifas internacionales e información sobre los planes de llamadas internacionales en línea en www.spectrum.net/rates.</li>
<li>Modificaciones del Servicio de voz: Spectrum puede, ocasionalmente, ofrecer características o funcionalidades adicionales del Servicio de voz o bien suspender ciertas características o funcionalidades del Servicio de voz.
La información acerca de estas características o funciones estará disponible en la Guía de precios correspondiente en www.Spectrum.com, en "Condiciones del servicio/Políticas".
Estas características o funciones adicionales del Servicio de voz pueden estar sujetas a términos y condiciones específicos adicionales, así como también a cambios por parte de Spectrum en cualquier momento.</li>
<li>Nombre de la persona que llama: el Servicio Spectrum Voice asociará el nombre del Abonado en la cuenta de Spectrum al número de teléfono que se mostrará junto con los servicios de búsqueda de nombres de quienes llaman ("CNAM") proporcionados como parte del Servicio de voz para todas las llamadas realizadas desde cualquier número de teléfono Spectrum en la cuenta.
Si el Abonado desea modificar el nombre de la persona que llama asociado al CNAM, debe aceptar lo siguiente: la propuesta o propuestas de nombre de la persona que llama no debe(n) inducir a error o suplantar a otra persona o compañía.
no debe(n) contener información falsa y debe(n) representar fielmente el nombre de la persona que está suscrita al Servicio de voz e incluida en los listados de directorio, en caso de existir alguno.
no debe(n) contener palabras abusivas, difamatorias, vulgares, obscenas, racistas o cualquier otro lenguaje ofensivo hacia cualquier persona o entidad, según lo determine Spectrum, a su exclusivo criterio.
y debe(n) cumplir con todas las leyes, normativas y regulaciones correspondientes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitaciones del Servicio de voz:<ol>
<li>Cortes de Servicio: el módem del Servicio Spectrum Voice funciona con electricidad, por lo que no podrá funcionar cuando haya cortes de energía o si se interrumpe o no funciona la conexión a la banda ancha.
En el caso de que ocurran cortes de energía, no funcionarán ni el módem ni ninguno de los teléfonos y Servicios de voz conectados.
Los cortes de energía interrumpirán el servicio E-911 y el uso del Servicio Spectrum Voice así como también la conexión entre el sistema de seguridad residencial y los servicios de monitoreo central.
Para reducir el riesgo, el Abonado puede elegir comprar una batería de respaldo para usar en caso de corte de energía que no comprometa a la red.</li>
<li>Sistemas de seguridad residencial: aunque el Servicio Spectrum Voice proporcionará una conexión que permita el funcionamiento del sistema de seguridad residencial existente del Abonado, Spectrum no garantiza que dicho sistema funcione completamente después de la instalación del Servicio de voz.
Como tal, es la obligación del Abonado contactar al proveedor de su sistema de seguridad residencial para informarle sobre la instalación del Servicio Spectrum Voice y sobre cualquier cambio en el número de teléfono, además de solicitar una prueba completa de funcionamiento del sistema inmediatamente después de la instalación del Servicio de voz.
También es responsabilidad del Abonado probar sus sistemas de manera regular.
En el caso de un corte de energía o de la red (ya sea sin planificar o relacionado con el mantenimiento), no funcionará ni el Servicio de voz del Abonado ni ninguno de los sistemas de seguridad residencial que usa el Servicio de voz para conectarse a la estación central de monitoreo.
Como se detalla anteriormente en la Sección 3(b)(iv), el Abonado puede adquirir, por separado, una batería de respaldo para su módem y utilizarla en casos de cortes de energía no relacionados con la red.<br>
Como cualquier otro proveedor de servicios de comunicación, no declaramos que nuestro servicio es infalible.
Además, Spectrum prohíbe el uso del Servicio Spectrum Voice como la conexión entre los sistemas de alerta médica y un servicio de estación central de monitoreo, y no conectaremos dichos servicios ni proporcionaremos soporte técnico para la conexión.</li>
<li>Limitaciones adicionales:<ol>
<li>En la actualidad, determinados servicios asistidos por operadores tales como la verificación de línea ocupada y la interrupción de la línea ocupada, los servicios de marcado (10-10-XXX), los servicios de pago (servicios 900 y 976) y la facturación a terceros no se ofrecen con el Servicio de voz.</li>
<li>Si el Abonado recibe Correo de voz, puede ser elegible para la función voz a texto o voz a e-mail ("Correo de voz legible"), como parte de la característica Correo de voz.
Como resultado del software de reconocimiento de voz usado por Spectrum, es posible que algunos mensajes procesados no se transcriban por completo y aparezcan como mensajes incompletos.
En dichos casos, el Abonado puede conseguir el mensaje completo al escuchar el mensaje de Correo de voz legible.
Como una condición del uso de la función de texto a voz o de voz a e-mail, el Abonado acepta permitir a Spectrum, o a sus proveedores de servicio, procesar dichos archivos de voz y usar los mensajes del correo de voz, y otros datos asociados con dichos mensajes, para mejorar y/o perfeccionar la función.</li>
<li>La obligación de Spectrum de instalar los Servicios de voz depende de su capacidad para proteger y conservar, sin costos excesivos, las instalaciones adecuadas y los derechos para la construcción y el mantenimiento de las instalaciones necesarias y los equipos.
Es posible que Spectrum limite las comunicaciones, se rehúse a proporcionar Servicios de voz o interrumpa los Servicios de voz cuando sea necesario debido a: (i) la falta de medios de transmisión, capacidad de transmisión o cualquier otro tipo de instalaciones o equipos.
(ii) la falta de servicios disponibles de, o interconectados con, los servicios o las instalaciones de los proveedores de servicio.
o (iii) cualquier otra causa que exceda el control de Spectrum.</li>
<li>Spectrum realizará esfuerzos razonables para lograr que los Servicios de voz estén disponibles en la fecha prevista.
Spectrum no será responsable de ningún daño que ocurra debido a las demoras en cumplir con la fecha de servicio estimada dados los procesos normales de instalación.
Dichas demoras deberán incluir, entre otras, las demoras en la obtención de aprobaciones de permiso de paso, demoras en el trabajo actual de construcción hecho por Spectrum, incluso sus contratistas o representantes, y cualquier demora debida a otros proveedores de servicios en los que Spectrum confía para que cumplan con la fecha estimada que está fuera del control de Spectrum.</li>
<li>Spectrum ofrece el uso de sus instalaciones para la comunicación entre el Abonado y terceros.
Spectrum no es responsable, ni será responsable legal, por ninguna comunicación o error en la comunicación entre el Abonado (incluso cualquier usuario) y las otras partes (incluso las llamadas a través de un operador, al 911 y E-911).</li>
<li>A criterio de Spectrum, las instalaciones de otros proveedores de servicio pueden utilizarse para establecer las conexiones en los puntos donde las instalaciones de Spectrum no puedan llegar.
Al establecer conexiones con otros proveedores, Spectrum no es responsable ni responsable legal de ninguna actividad o inactividad de otros proveedores de servicios.</li>
<li>Spectrum proporciona la aplicación móvil Phone2Go únicamente para que la utilicen los clientes del Servicio de voz residencial de Spectrum y solo en ciertas áreas.
Es posible que ciertas funciones del Servicio Spectrum Voice no estén disponibles con la aplicación Phone2Go y ciertas funciones disponibles dentro de la aplicación Phone2Go pueden estar sujetas a términos y condiciones adicionales presentados dentro de la aplicación Phone2Go.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Equipo: el Servicio Spectrum Voice requiere un módem de voz.
Spectrum proporcionará un módem de voz durante el tiempo en el que el Abonado siga siendo Abonado del Servicio de voz o hasta que Spectrum cambie su oferta del Servicio de voz.
Dependiendo del plan de Servicio Spectrum Voice, puede haber un cargo mensual por el módem de voz.
Al cancelar el Servicio Spectrum Voice por cualquier motivo, es posible que el Abonado deba entregar el módem de voz proporcionado por Spectrum en el plazo de treinta (30) días o se le cobrará una tarifa por el equipo igual a la cobrada por Spectrum en el momento que suministró el módem de voz.
La excepción a esta política de devolución es cuando el módem también es un servicio de Internet de respaldo, en cuyo caso, el Abonado puede continuar usando el módem hasta dicho tiempo en el que ya no se proporciona el servicio de Internet o Spectrum solicita una sustitución del módem.
El equipo y las instalaciones proporcionados por Spectrum para prestar el Servicio de voz (excepto por el cableado interno y los tomas interiores) son propiedad de Spectrum.
Los números de teléfono asignados al Abonado por parte de Spectrum son portables y transferibles con el Abonado en la misma ubicación.
sin embargo, el Abonado no tiene derechos de propiedad sobre el número de teléfono ni las designaciones del número de llamadas asociado con los Servicios de voz.
Además, Spectrum puede cambiar dichos números según lo considere necesario.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Plazo: el Servicio Spectrum Voice continuará hasta el momento en que el Abonado cancele el servicio, lo que tendrá vigencia al momento de la notificación, o bien Spectrum lo cancelará por infracción (incluso la falta de pago) de este Acuerdo o según lo determine Spectrum de conformidad con las Condiciones del servicio.</li>
<li>Incorporación al directorio: el Servicio Spectrum Voice le ofrece al Abonado un servicio de Número privado de manera predeterminada o la incorporación al directorio por solicitud.
Según la ubicación y la preferencia del Abonado, el Servicio Spectrum Voice puede incluir un (1) directorio telefónico básico de páginas blancas ordenado alfabéticamente u otro directorio en línea comparable con una lista de los nombres en orden alfabético, números de teléfono y direcciones de todos los clientes del servicio telefónico en un área geográfica en particular fijada por el editor.
La lista alfabética de los nombres de los clientes tiene como objetivo informar a las partes interesadas acerca del número de teléfono y la dirección de los clientes enumerados.
Los nombres se pueden ordenar o disponer de una manera especial por un cargo adicional.
Las listas deben amoldarse a las normas de la editorial con respecto a los directorios publicados.
Spectrum limita la longitud de las listas del directorio al usar abreviaturas cuando, según la opinión de Spectrum, no se compromete la claridad de las listas ni la identificación del cliente al hacerlo.
La duración de las incorporaciones al directorio, cuando las incorporaciones han sido publicadas, es la misma que la duración del directorio.
El período del directorio va desde el día en el que el directorio se distribuye por primera vez a los clientes hasta el día en que el directorio siguiente se distribuye a los clientes.
La responsabilidad de Spectrum con respecto a los errores u omisiones relacionados con las incorporaciones al directorio se establece en la Sección 7, "Limitación de responsabilidad".</li>
<li>Limitación de responsabilidad:<ol>

FINALMENTE, SPECTRUM, Y SUS PROVEEDORES DE SERVICIO, NO SERÁN RESPONSABLES DE NINGUNA PÉRDIDA O INTERRUPCIÓN DEL SERVICIO DE VOZ NI POR NINGÚN DAÑO O PÉRDIDA DEBIDOS A LA FALLA O NEGLIGENCIA DEL ABONADO, CUALQUIER USUARIO DEL ABONADO O CUALQUIER OTRO TERCERO O PERSONA, O DEBIDO A LA FALLA O MAL FUNCIONAMIENTO DEL EQUIPO O LAS INSTALACIONES PROPORCIONADOS POR EL ABONADO O EL USUARIO, O DEBIDO AL INCUMPLIMIENTO POR PARTE DEL ABONADO DE CUALQUIER OBLIGACIÓN ESTABLECIDA EN ESTE ACUERDO.</li>
<li>Directorios telefónicos.
LA RESPONSABILIDAD DE SPECTRUM POR DAÑOS DEBIDO A ERRORES U OMISIONES EN LAS INCORPORACIONES AL DIRECTORIO SE LIMITARÁ A LA ACREDITACIÓN POR ÚNICA VEZ DEL EQUIVALENTE A LA TARIFA MENSUAL RECURRENTE DE UN MES DEL SERVICIO DE VOZ (NO INCLUYE CARGOS ÚNICOS, CARGOS MEDIDOS O POR LLAMADA NI NINGÚN IMPUESTO O CARGO RELACIONADO).
EL ABONADO ACEPTA INDEMNIZAR Y EXIMIR DE RESPONSABILIDAD A SPECTRUM EN CUANTO A CUALQUIER Y TODA RECLAMACIÓN POR DAÑOS PROVOCADOS O ACUSADOS DE HABER SIDO PROVOCADOS, DIRECTA O INDIRECTAMENTE, POR LA PUBLICACIÓN DE UNA LISTA QUE EL ABONADO HAYA SOLICITADO SE OMITA DE LAS PÁGINAS BLANCAS DEL DIRECTORIO CORRESPONDIENTE, INCLUIDO CUALQUIER DIRECTORIO EN LÍNEA, O LA DIVULGACIÓN DE TAL LISTA A CUALQUIER PERSONA (INCLUIDO CUALQUIER ERROR O EQUIVOCACIÓN PRESENTE EN DICHA LISTA).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Instalación: Los cargos por los servicios y el equipo de instalación dependerán de la tarifa actual en vigencia.</li>
<li>Impuestos: las tarifas, los impuestos y los recargos correspondientes, si los hubiera, se sumarán a la factura mensual del Abonado.

<li>Derechos de propiedad: Spectrum y/o sus proveedores de servicio tienen todos los derechos sobre los Servicios de voz.
El Abonado tiene un derecho limitado a usar el Servicio de voz según estas Condiciones del Servicio de voz.
Sin embargo, las Condiciones del servicio no otorgan al Abonado (ni a los usuarios) ningún derecho, o interés, patentes, derechos de autor, derecho a base de datos, secretos comerciales, nombres comerciales, marcas comerciales o marcas de servicio (registradas o sin registrar), o cualquier derecho o licencia relacionados con el Servicio Spectrum Voice (incluso todas las funciones) o cualquier documentación relacionada.</li>

Además, ni la marcación automática ni la marcación predictiva se pueden usar con el Servicio Spectrum Voice.
El Servicio Spectrum Voice está destinado a ser usado de acuerdo con el uso residencial normal pretendido.
