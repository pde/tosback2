</ul> Cookie Policy <p>Last Updated: February 27, 2017</p>
<p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to Indeed’s use of Cookies as follows:</p>
<p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”).
“Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.
 Like most websites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website.
For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform.
We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li>
<li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website.
For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li>
<li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes.
These Cookies allow us to display Indeed promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.
Indeed may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.</li>
<li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Website, or to associate user activity that Indeed referred to a third party website.
These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website, or give Indeed credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites.
We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.
Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.

<p>In addition, if you would like to remove yourself from Indeed’s job seeker web beacon, you must click here.
Indeed may also provide an employer with code for a Conversion Tracker to place on its website that pings the job seeker web beacon and tracks whenever a job seeker has applied to a job on that employer’s website.
This Conversion Tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Indeed does not and cannot collect any of the job seeker’s personally identifiable information and does not have access to the cookies in the employer’s domain.
The Conversion Tracker is simply a counter that notifies Indeed that a job seeker has applied.
If a job seeker has disabled the web beacon, the Conversion Tracker will have no functionality.</p>
<p>Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers.
Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Website.
This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
To provide website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs.</p>

Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed values the trust our users and customers place in us when they give us access to their Personal Information.
The Privacy Policy describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect that information.</p>
<p>Indeed has created this Privacy Policy in order to describe its collection, use and disclosure of personal data you give to Indeed when you access or use Indeed’s online and/or mobile services and websites, and software provided by Indeed on or in connection with such services or websites (collectively, the “Site”).

Indeed reserves the right to share data in accordance with this Privacy Policy between and amongst the aforementioned Indeed entities.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers only data that we collect through the Site, and not any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, the data collection practices of any affiliate or other third party, including any third-party operators of web pages to which the Site links, and any information that we collect offline or through any websites, products, or services that do not display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
Occasionally, we may refer to this Privacy Policy in notices and consent requests related to special purpose web pages, mobile applications, or other resources, for example, if we invite you to submit ideas to improve the Site; under such circumstances, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through such special purpose resources, as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g., with respect to the types of data collected or our uses or disclosures of such information) Indeed may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.

Information Collected</strong>
</p>
<p>When you create an Indeed account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site, we collect such data including, but not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you, which you answer.
In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., credit card number and related verification information).
If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
In each such instance above, you will know what data we collect through the Site, or collect through screening, because you actively submit it. </p>
<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook.
If you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook account.
Facebook may also ask for your permission to share certain details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information and email address.
If you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook will authenticate you and redirect you to the Site.
Please note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook account, Facebook will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook user.
By granting Indeed access to your Facebook account, you understand that Indeed will access, make available and store the information that you provide to Indeed from your Facebook account so that it may be available on and through the Site via your Indeed account.
This information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of the Site.
You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook account.
PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Indeed may automatically collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device, including, but not limited to, your browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site, and if you are accessing our Site with your mobile device, the type of mobile device.
In addition, we may automatically record and analyze actions taken on the Site including, but not limited to, date and times of use, clicks, page views, the amount of time you spend on each page, and search queries.
Indeed reserves the right to match your IP address (or any other information) with other information about you in any way permitted by applicable law.
Indeed will store this information on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with for that purpose.
If you create an Indeed account, information may be collected under your account email address.</p>
<p>If you access or use the Site on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address.
Indeed may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, geolocation or email address.</p>
<p>If you are an Employer, Indeed may request that you provide certain personal information to Indeed in order to verify your account.
This information includes, but is not limited to your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill.
This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Limitation of Use or Disclosure of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>When a Job Seeker deletes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data which we provided under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, job alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data will not become available to the Job Seeker again.
Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a deleted account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights as allowed by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, to keep an email address).
A deleted account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name.
When the Job Seeker presses the delete account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>
<p>Employers may disable an account, however Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.
If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on Indeed’s site, they will need to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.
When a Job Seeker creates a resume on Indeed, they are given the option to make their resume public or private.
Public resumes are available to anyone with access to Indeed’s resume search application.
Private resumes are only made available to those whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.
For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through Indeed (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an employer, 2) we may direct you to that employer for personal data deletion requests, and 3) Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.
In the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.
Indeed has no liability for such applications.
If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the employer.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
Uses and Disclosures of Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use any information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including information that identifies you as a specific individual (“Personal Information”), for the purposes set forth in this Paragraph 4 and Paragraphs 5, 6, and 10 below.
Indeed uses such information to provide our services and features to you, including to provide employer information to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed uses your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), or application materials and answers to screener questions, to determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs or reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.
Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Information, to employers that may be interested in contacting you.
By applying to a job, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or by replying to a message from an employer, you consent to the disclosure of your information to that employer.
Indeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your Indeed Resume to pre-populate application information for you and for other similar purposes.
 </p>
<p>More specifically, you take a variety of actions on our Site.
For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for, where those jobs are located, any information, including salary interest or experience of which you have informed Indeed, or the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to or any of your other behavior on the Indeed site, when you use Indeed.
You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity.
If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.
You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior.</p>
<p>Indeed may also share such information with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.</p>
<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to prevent potentially illegal activities and activities that are detrimental to you or others.
Indeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Site; or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public; or (d) as necessary to meet  national security requirements.
Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission or other investigatory bodies of the United States.</p>
<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam.
These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products, including: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, and Post a Job.
By utilizing this Indeed relay function in connection with any of the aforementioned products, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.
We monitor, review, store and analyze your content (including your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials) that you send, store or receive, including via automated means and otherwise, for data analysis, quality control, and to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for job seekers and employers, provide you with personally relevant product features, and to prevent and block fraud and spam or reduce unwanted mail).  When communicating through Indeed’s relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.
You retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers’ Job Listings, but owned by Indeed.
Indeed’s relay system will show the name associated with your account or job application in the “To:” or “From:” field.
Please note that since these message proxy and relay services depend on the functionality of third party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.
If you share the Indeed-owned email address with someone other than yourself, and they send an email to this email address, Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of the sender of that email with the Employer associated with that email address’ Job Listing.
Indeed reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that Indeed determines do not adhere to Site Rules or any of the terms of this agreement. </p>
<p>
<strong>Any information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with or transferred to any Indeed affiliated entity (including those located outside the European Union or Switzerland, or Indeed Hire, Inc.), no matter where located, for the purpose of providing you services and improving the Site.
By using the Site, you consent to this transfer and acknowledge that the services provided  to you and the functionality of the Site could not be provided without such a transfer.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<b>Transfer of Data to Third Parties</b>
</p>
<p>We may use other companies, including affiliates and third parties, to perform services in connection with our operations, and to improve the Site and our other products and services.
These third parties may include (but are not limited to) service providers and vendors.</p>
<p>In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to Personal Information, and such Personal Information may be transferred to other countries.
Those companies are contractually required to treat such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Information, by these companies.
Please see paragraph 11 for liabilities related to the transfer of Personal Data for EU and Swiss Residents.</p>
<p>You may also use certain third-party sites or services that you link to from Indeed’s Site.
In such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to Indeed, and is subject to the third party’s privacy policy and terms of service.
Please see the section below titled Links to Third-Party Sites for more information.</p>
<p>Indeed may use your IP address and mobile device information to help diagnose problems with Indeed’s service and to administer the Site.
Your IP address and mobile device information may also be used to help identify you, your location, and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information (such as country of origin).
Indeed may maintain   (as permitted by applicable law) information collected from you pursuant to this Privacy Policy following any termination of your relationship with Indeed.
Indeed may also delete such information as permitted by applicable law.
If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment.
Indeed may also aggregate your data with other data, for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p>If you post your resume on Indeed, please note that although Indeed expressly prohibits the scraping of its Site any resume you post publicly is public information and the content may be copied by a third party in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
Contact and Resume Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When you give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information, you agree that Indeed may utilize this information as set forth herein.
You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.
If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Indeed or its designated third-party partners may also use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts; (ii) create an account; and (iii) send you information about Indeed, including promotional materials.
A job alert is defined as an email sent to you that you sign up for containing Job Listings in response to a search query you have run (“Job Alert”).
Job Alerts may also include jobs that Indeed recommends for you, Indeed Targeted Ads, companies you may be interested in following, or other actions you may want to take on the Site.
Indeed may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on the Site, show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.
Your information, including Personal Information, gets placed on the Site when you upload or edit a resume.
To the extent you upload a resume or edit it, and subject to your Privacy Settings, you are making the resume, your name and other Personal Information that you place on your resume available to third parties who may be interested in you as an employee (and who may forward your resume and Personal Information to other third parties), to Job Seekers who may want to contact you, to search engines, or to the general public by posting your Personal Information on the internet.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to job seekers and employers).
If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name.
This means that third parties can view the Personal Information contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility.
If you do not want your Personal Information posted on the Site, you should not upload it.
You may opt out of this feature on a going forward basis by editing your Privacy Settings; however, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.
Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Information, as part of Indeed’s services.
At your direction, Indeed may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a job listing.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
Additional Uses and Disclosures of Non-Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the other uses and disclosures of information set forth in this Privacy Policy, and notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may use and disclosure, for any purpose, any information that does not identify you as a specific individual (“Non-Personal Information”), except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
Such Non-Personal Information may include, for example and without limitation: MAC addresses and other device identifiers; IP addresses; pixel tags and similar technologies; physical location information; and demographic information, including gender, dates of birth, ZIP codes, etc.

<p>
<strong>1. The Indeed Services</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may make available certain job listings and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (such listings and other contents, (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
Job Listings are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control.
you acknowledge and understand that we have no control over Job Listings.
Except for certain sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Listings contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.
<strong>
<i>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Job Listing, or to include any Job Listing in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Listing from the Site for any or no reason.</i>
</strong> We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Listing or other information submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such employer or other user.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Listing.
You agree that Indeed may also provide search options to narrow down Job Listing search results by job type (i.e.
full-time, part-time, etc.), and such job types are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and are not a direct reflection of the actual Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(a) Notice to Users Applying to Jobs Through Indeed: </strong>If you are a Job Seeker, any resume or application information that you submit through the Site is subject to this Agreement (including Section 4 below) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Without limiting the foregoing, however, please note that by creating a public Indeed Resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to any Employer that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume.
By creating or uploading an Indeed Resume, Indeed may contact you to share Job Listings with you that match the contents of your Indeed Resume.
In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply (hereinafter, all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed” or any similar references are referred to as “Indeed Apply”) you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to reformat the job so that you may read it more clearly in your phone, you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).
When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system, you understand that this is without warranty.
Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any such resume or application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>
<p>In addition, by using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s application form, messages, screener questions, testing assessments or their format or method of delivery and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer.
Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers.<strong> If you require </strong>
<b>alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process. </b>
</p>
<p>By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not answered the questions in a manner that the Employer so wishes, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
When you apply to a job using the Indeed Apply button, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent.
We cannot vouch for the validity of such contact information provided to us.
If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose.
Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
Indeed may use your application materials (including public resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing.
 <strong>Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1(b) </strong>If you are an Employer, when you create an Indeed account, a Career Page or post a Job Listing on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of Indeed’s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you and to the Job Seekers using such Career Page or indicating an interest in such Job Listings.
 Specifically, when you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called NetVerify. By using NetVerify, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to NetVerify, you are agreeing to share your identification with NetVerify, and you agree that NetVerify is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.
Indeed may have access to your identification documents via NetVerify. You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with such Job Listing, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide us with.
When you use the Indeed Apply relay function, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add certain functions into the email, which allows you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker including setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate, and that you consent to Indeed monitoring and analyzing these actions.
When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, the Employer.
Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by You.
In the event You provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.
In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview.
Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. Indeed is not responsible for the content of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, and Indeed does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction.
If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your Employer dashboard.
You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections (which is purely mechanical), that transmission is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. You agree that Indeed Apply is presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.
You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
When you respond to or contact a Job Seeker who has used Indeed Resume, or Indeed Apply, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.
Additionally, you consent to Job Seekers’ applications and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
You are responsible for the contents of any Career Page that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, including any questions for Job Seekers.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Career Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Page created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing).
Indeed may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion.
To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(c) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, when you send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When you send, store or receive materials through or using the Site, Indeed may also inform a Job Seeker that an Employer has taken an action with regards to a Job Seeker’s application such as opening the application, viewing the application and making a decision with regards to the application, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any job listing, Career Page, job solicitation, screener question, answer to screener question, resume information you post, send or receive through the Site.
If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(d) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may use application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing, and vice-versa.
Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, you agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and presenting them to Employers as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>
<strong>1(e)</strong> Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide certain categories of information to you for informational purposes only.
For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a certain Job Listing, or about estimated applies to a Job Listing you may receive as an Employer.
 These figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
 With respect to information regarding estimated applies, if you are an Employer participating in the Indeed Ads Program, please note that this is not the information you are purchasing from Indeed and you are not charged per apply.
Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site. Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed.
These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.
Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(f)</strong> Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide certain types of career-related information on its Site in the Indeed Career Guide.
All information contained in the Indeed Career Guide is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling.
You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.
You further understand that in providing the Indeed Career Guide, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm.
You also understand that by referring to the Indeed Career Guide, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for use of these services.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(g</strong>
<strong>) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide you an online questionnaire relating to your industry and/or your hiring or job searching needs.
Indeed may match a Job Seeker’s responses to such questionnaires to determine, on the basis of the Employer’s responses to a questionnaire about its industry and/or hiring needs, whether such Job Seeker would match the Employer’s hiring criteria as specified in the Employer’s questionnaire responses.
In the event Indeed determines that a Job Seeker matches the Employer’s hiring criteria, Indeed may connect such matching Job Seeker and Employer by sending a note informing both parties of the match, including but not limited to sending an Employer a short description of a Job Seeker taken directly from the Job Seeker’s responses to the questionnaire.
In all events you will know what data we are providing to either a Job Seeker or Employer, or upon which we relied to make the match, because you have actively submitted it.
If the Employer and Job Seeker express interest in each other, you agree Indeed may provide the Employer with an email address for the Job Seeker either provided by Indeed or the Job Seeker and, if you are a Job Seeker, you consent to this.
Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, by submitting the completed questionnaire, you agree and consent to Indeed (i) conducting such matching, utilizing only material you have submitted through the questionnaire process, (ii) presenting matching Job Seekers to Employers, and vice versa and (iii) storing and analyzing such data submitted in response to such online questionnaires.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(h) </strong>If you are a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site.
For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for, where those jobs are located, any information, including salary interest or experience of which you have informed Indeed, or the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, or any of your other behavior on the Indeed site, when you use Indeed.
You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity.
If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.
You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior for Employers or for Indeed itself.
Please note, although information may be sent to you by a third party through the Indeed system, the aforementioned behavior does not include information relayed to you.
However, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site or the fact that you have recently used the Indeed system to correspond with a third party.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(i) </strong>If you are a Job Seeker located in India, please note that Indeed may automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job.
Indeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself, searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.</p>
<p>

<p>

Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine.
By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.

User Content</strong>
</p>
<p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums, may allow users to post Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site is referred to herein as “User Content”).
Such functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, facilitate communication, discuss ways to make career decisions, and to let users know of jobs.
User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names.
User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive.
For example, the Site hosts Company Pages, which allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company who owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&amp;A questions on Company Pages.
Indeed does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein.
You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p>
<p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.
You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier.
Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences.
Indeed may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information.
Indeed reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.</p>
<p>Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message, or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.
If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact Indeed immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal.
For clarity, Indeed does not have any obligation to remove any User Content, and the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site.
to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors.
and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.
This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.
As an Employer, when you post a Job Listing on Indeed that you choose to list as confidential, your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Indeed reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers.
Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability.
Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements.
You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>
<p>Please note: Section 230 of the U.S.
Communications Decency Act provides that:</p>
<p>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</p>
<p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
<p>(2) Civil liability</p>
<p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-</p>
<p>(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.

Claims of Infringement</strong>
</p>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.

Indeed Resume/CV Program Terms <p>These Indeed Resume Program Terms or Indeed CV Program Terms (collectively, “IRP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Program, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Resume Program Terms.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, which may be modified at any time.
You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system.
Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program.
In addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you agree to pay to Indeed the amount indicated on the Site so that Indeed will facilitate your sending of a message, indicating your interest, to the email address that the relevant resume submitter has provided to Indeed.
Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.
In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which Indeed defines as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role.
Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRP Terms, including the foregoing term.
We reserve the right to drop any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason.
<strong>The only acceptable use of the IRP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment.
No other uses of the IRP are permitted.
</strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you.</p>
<p>
<strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones.
You agree to call Job Seekers regarding relevant job opportunities only.
It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing systems.</strong>

<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Ads Program (“Program”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Website, if you are using the Ads Program, through our on-line forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including Job Listings and screener questions) and target URLs (“Creative”), including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed, whether generated by or for you.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
Job Ads may be placed on (y) any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (“Partner”) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (“Partner Property”).
Distribution within Indeed’s Partner Properties does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations.
You shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Partner Properties.
By posting a Job Ad, including by XML feed, on Indeed: (i) you authorize Indeed to reformat and host the Job Ad to be effectively displayed on a mobile device and (ii) you authorize Indeed to reformat and host the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page so it can be displayed more effectively on Indeed or its publisher network.
All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks on the Indeed reformatted and hosted page.
In the event you provide Indeed with an End Date beyond which your Job Ad shall not run, thirty days before such End Date Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) next to the word “Sponsored” on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed.
Indeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, “Ad”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Sponsored”, “Urgent” or similar) to constitute an advertisement on Indeed.
Job Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a certain period of time.
in some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again.
However, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a certain period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility.
Indeed may offer certain Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently on the Site (“Featured Employer”).
Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend.
The Featured Employer program may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion.
When you post a Job Ad directly on Indeed, Indeed may automatically generate for you a Company Page.
You authorize Indeed to claim such Company Page for you on your behalf, which will be marked as a “Claimed Profile” and allows you to edit and add information to the Company Page.
Company Pages allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company who owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&amp;A questions on Company Pages.
Additionally, Indeed may include all of your Job Ads posted on the Site on your Company Page, including but not limited to those posted directly on Indeed as well as those indexed by Indeed.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
Indeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice.
Indeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Prohibited Uses</strong>
</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks.
or (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IAP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. <i>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Job Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.
For examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to the Job Posting Guidelines.
Indeed may require certain Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, and to prevent abuse of the free to post system.
This may include limiting the number of Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time without sponsoring, in Indeed’s sole discretion.
This requirement may be made in Indeed’s sole discretion.
For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.
Additionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer’s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason.
If you are a job board, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads.
For examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the Job Board Inclusion Guidelines.
As a job board, <i>you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company.
you may not post Job Ads on the Site for your client</i>
<i>s and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account.
</i>You acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation of these guidelines on the Indeed Site may harm Indeed and its users. </i>When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called NetVerify.
By using NetVerify, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to NetVerify, you are agreeing to share your identification with NetVerify, and you agree that NetVerify is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.
Indeed may have access to your identification documents via NetVerify.</p>

Indeed Prime Terms <p>Last Updated: July 10, 2017</p>
<p>These Indeed Prime Terms (“IP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Indeed Prime in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Indeed Prime, you agree to these Indeed Prime Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
The term “You” refers to the Candidate, the Employer or the Referrer, as per the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>
<b>1.
Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed Prime is an online tool that allows Indeed Prime Employers (“Employers”) to connect with Candidate Job Seekers (“Candidates”).
The term “Candidate” will refer to users of Indeed Prime who are seeking employment opportunities through Indeed Prime.
The term “Employer” will refer to a company that is interested in hiring the Candidates through the Indeed Prime online tool.</p>
<p>Users who wish to participate in Indeed Prime apply to Indeed to enter an Indeed Prime Talent List of Candidates (“List”).
Not all users who apply to Indeed Prime will be accepted into the program as a Candidate.
If Indeed chooses a Candidate to participate in Indeed Prime, they are placed into the List and they will remain in the List for such a time as determined by Indeed, as per Indeed rules, as set forth below.
Employers who are using the Indeed Prime tool are shown those relevant Candidates in the List.
Employers may choose to interview Candidates from the List and conduct a hiring process with such Candidate if they wish.
There is a charge for use of this tool to the Employers, as set forth below.
There is no charge to Candidates who are chosen from the List.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Applying to Indeed Prime</b>
</p>
<p>Candidate:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as a Candidate you must create an Indeed account or login using your preexisting Indeed account, create a profile and apply.
When applying to Indeed Prime, we may require you to provide us with certain information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, skill set, salary requirements and geographic location.
At this stage, you will have the opportunity to block your profile from certain Employers.
We will use the information that you provide us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We may use a third party vendor to help us review your application.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to use Indeed Prime.
If you are accepted into Indeed Prime, we will notify you via email.
Once you have been accepted, a member of the Indeed Prime Talent Team (“Talent Consultant”) may reach out to via the email address or phone number you provided, and work with you to finalize your Candidate profile.
The Talent Consultant may continue to work with you throughout your time on Indeed Prime.</p>
<p>Employer:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as an Employer you must also apply.
Applying to be an Employer is free.
When applying we may ask you for additional information related to your company, including but not limited to, your name, email address, company URL, phone number and geographic location.
We will review the information that you provided to us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to Indeed Prime.
If your application is accepted, you will be notified via email and allowed to use the Indeed Prime online tool so as to engage with, and reach out to Candidates that are available in the Indeed Prime List.</p>
<p>
<b>3.
Talent List</b>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>After a Candidate has applied and been accepted to Indeed Prime, he or she will be placed into the List to be viewed by Employers using the Indeed Prime tool.
Employers will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates in the List.
Candidates may receive emails from Employers informing them of their interest in the Candidate, and providing them details about the job solicitation.
Indeed has no input into the Employer’s selection process.
A Candidate may, but is not required to, respond to any Employer that has contacted him or her.
All requests for interviews by Employers through Indeed Prime do not guarantee a final job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary.</p>
<p>A new Candidate may be highlighted as “new” in the Talent List.
At the conclusion of a certain number of weeks Indeed may remove any candidate on the List, at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion and, in such case, the Candidate may reapply through its Talent Consultant for consideration to be reentered into the List.
The reapplication process is at Indeed’s sole discretion, and not all re-applications will be granted.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>After an Employer’s application has been accepted by Indeed Prime, the Employer will be able to utilize the Indeed Prime tool in order to browse the Candidates in the List, communicate with these Candidates, and submit interview requests to Candidates.
Once an Employer has discovered a Candidate on Indeed Prime, the Employer may make the contact with the Candidate through the Indeed Prime tool.
No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Employer through the use of Indeed Prime.
The Candidate is not obligated to accept any offer provided to a Candidate from an Employer that contacts them through Indeed Prime.
Additionally, offers or interview requests submitted by an Employer to a Candidate through Indeed Prime are not binding on the Employer.
Employer agrees that Indeed is entitled to publish the details of all non-binding offers made and the identity of those parties that have made such offers.</p>
<p>If an Employer is on the Pay-Per-Hire pricing model, the Employer agrees not to attempt to circumvent Indeed Prime by independently attempting to make the first contact with Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Indeed Prime.
 Further, if the Employer can establish that it was in Negotiation with regards to hiring with the Candidate prior to utilizing the Prime tool, the Employer may be exempted from paying the Fee at the sole discretion of Indeed.
“Negotiation” shall mean at least one direct email sent out by both parties, Candidate and Employer, specifically to the other and not sent as part of a mass emailing, for the purpose of recruiting or hiring, within the three (3) months prior to the Employer using the Prime tool, and where no final decision to hire or reject a Candidate or to accept or reject the Employer has been made.
In the event an Employer is on the Pay-Per-Hire pricing model and circumvents the Indeed Prime process after discovering a candidate on Indeed Prime, or does not report a hire made through Indeed Prime, and thereafter hires that candidate within six (6) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the candidate on Indeed Prime, Indeed Prime shall be entitled to 25% of a Candidate’s annual or term salary (if the term of hire is for less than one year) and all costs of collection of such amount, including any legal fees.</p>
<p>Indeed’s Role:</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agent by providing the Indeed Prime product.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Candidates and Employers to connect with each other.
Candidates and Employers are solely responsible for the information provided in any resume or profile, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Prime.</p>
<p>You understand that Indeed Prime does not inquire into the backgrounds of its Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of its Candidates or Employers, and that you are responsible for (1) conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer, and (2) complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>

If no hires are made, the deposit is not returned.</li>

Hires initiated before cancellation are subject to the invoicing and payment stated above.</li>
</ol>

Indeed Targeted Ads Terms <p>Last Updated: August 29, 2017</p>
<p>These Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (“ITA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Targeted Ads program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ITA Terms.
 These ITA Terms apply to both of Indeed’s Targeted Ads Services: 1) Indeed Targeted Ads: Brand (“ITA Brand”) and 2) Indeed Targeted Ads: Apply (“ITA Apply”).</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ITA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>1.<b> The Program</b>
</p>
<p>Use of Indeed Targeted Ads (“ITA”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Site, and, if you are using ITA, through our online forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed through ITA, (“Targeted Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
Targeted Ads may be placed on any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”).
By posting a Targeted Ad on Indeed, you authorize Indeed to reformat the Job Ad to be effectively displayed on a mobile device.
 </p>
<p>
<b>ITA Apply</b>: In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to your post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”).
The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed.
However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement.
Any removal of the tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle to Indeed to any resulting damages.
 It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place.
The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include certain application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process.
If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed to the next stage of the application process, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.
You further acknowledge that your use of these application questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool and that Indeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these application questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers’ answers to your application questions.
