Introduction: What is a cookie?</strong>
</p>
<p>This Cookie policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Site (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”).
“Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the Site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.<br>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Site.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Site to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.

How Indeed uses cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for measurement services, better targeting ads, and for marketing purposes.

Indeed may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
We also use cookies to facilitate the Indeed Targeted Ads Program.

<strong>Analytical Purposes</strong> Indeed and its affiliates (as defined in section 4.13 of the Privacy Policy) use cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Site and the websites of Indeed affiliates.

In addition, we use cookies to maintain your logged in state when you visit our Site repeatedly.
We may also use your IP address to determine your geographic location at city or postal code level in order to provide you with the most relevant search results.

<strong>Referral Tracking</strong> We use cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Site, or to associate user activity that Indeed referred to a third party website.
Some of these third party websites are partner websites that receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Site, or give Indeed credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites.
We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.
However, we may share information, such as the third party website you were visiting when you clicked on an Indeed link to a Job Listing or Hiring Event, with Employers.

Indeed does not have access to the cookies in the employer’s domain.
The Conversion Tracker is simply a counter that notifies Indeed that a job seeker has applied.
If a job seeker has disabled the web beacon, the Conversion Tracker will have no functionality.

<b>2.
Information Collected</b>
<p>You provide different types of information in order for Indeed to provide our services, products and features to you.
Indeed associates this information with your Resume and account to create your Indeed Profile.</p>
<p>
<b>2.1 Information You Provide to Indeed</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– From Your Account</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>We collect data from you when you create an Indeed account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Indeed Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site.
This may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you.
This information may be associated with your profile.
You may provide your specific location data when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps (as defined in the Indeed Terms of Service Introduction) to help you find more relevant Job Listings (including from the location service on your mobile device when you grant permission to an Indeed App), or when you submit a photo to Job Spotter that includes the provision of the location data of where the photo was taken.
Indeed seeks your consent at the time of such provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured. </p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Through Your Activity on Indeed</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Indeed may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Site, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches on Indeed, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), your activity time on the Site and each page, page views, clicks, taps, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, MAC address, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site. </p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When Using Automated Phone Screening</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.
Where you wish to use such a product, you will agree in advance to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When Providing Employer Information</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>If you are an Employer, Indeed may request that you provide certain Personal Data to Indeed in order to verify your account.
This information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.
</p>
<p>This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.
In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information).
Please note that Indeed only has access to the last four digits of Employer credit card numbers, and does not store full credit card numbers.</p>
<p>
<b>2.2 Information Collected When You Apply for Jobs or Access Indeed from Some Third-Party Websites</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Sites</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also collect information about web sites and web pages you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome about job postings that you save, notes or applications statuses that you save or update, or data regarding how you engage with websites or other actions you take on such website, including URLs of websites you visit. We do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application form on a third-party website to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application. Indeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved job listing searches, job listing recommendations and product features. </p>
<p>When you apply for a job on certain Third-Party Websites, Indeed may also receive information about the status of your job application and the decisions taken by the Employer in disposing of your application, such as, for example, whether the application reached interview stage and whether a job offer was accepted or rejected.
This information helps Indeed further understand the effectiveness of our Site and its features.
Indeed uses this information for the purpose of improving the products and services we offer to Job Seekers and Employers and as otherwise detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When You Log In or Use Indeed from Some Third-Party Sites</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google.
If you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.
If you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Indeed’s Site.
Please note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.</p>
<p>By accessing Indeed through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed in the above paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access our Site in a secure manner.
You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account.
This information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of the Site.</p>
<p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account.
Facebook or Google may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.
Once you give this permission, the requested information will be shared with Indeed, which may use this information to provide Services to you, including populating your Indeed profile.
The shared information will remain associated with your Indeed profile until you modify or delete it.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>
<p>
<b>2.3 Any Other Personal Data Indeed May Receive from Third Parties</b>
</p>
<p>Any Personal Data that Indeed may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by Indeed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p>
<p>
<b>2.4 Storage of Your Information</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed stores your personal data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services (for example if an employer deletes an application to their Job Ad, Indeed may delete information associated with that application), or until you ask us to delete your personal data.
We may also be required to retain certain information in order to comply with local laws.</p>
<p>If you create an Indeed account, your information may be collected and stored in a manner that connects to your account email address.
Indeed may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code.
For example, while using a mobile device to access Indeed, Indeed may provide a Job Seeker with relevant job postings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place.
The collection of this data is solely used in accordance with the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with.
Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>2.5 What Personal Data is Required</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Indeed services or features to you.
Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p>
<p>
<b>2.6 The Legal Basis on Which Indeed Collects Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved.
More information is provided on this here.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Performance of a Contract</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Some of the Personal Data processed by Indeed is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
An example of this would be where Indeed sends a Job Seeker’s application to an Employer.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Legitimate Interest</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed.
Such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention.
A further example would be where Indeed shares your Personal Data with Indeed affiliates as detailed in section 4.13 below.
Indeed will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Compliance with a Legal Obligation</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Indeed to comply with a legal obligation.
An example of this would be where Indeed is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Consent</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Indeed relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.
Where Indeed requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
For example, your consent will be sought where you provide your location when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps to help you find more relevant Job Listings (including from the location service on your mobile device when you grant permission to an Indeed App), when you submit a photo to Job Spotter that includes the provision of the location data of where the photo was taken, or in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message such as a Job Alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy).
You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy where applicable, or by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<b>3.
Limitations of Use </b>
<p>
<b>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</b>
</p>
<p>When a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, Job Alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again.
Please also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to all Indeed products and the ability to utilize the “Log in with Indeed” feature found on certain third party sites.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement).
A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name.
When the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Close an Employer Account</b>
</p>
<p>Employers may close an account at any time by contacting Indeed Customer Support.
Please note that Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.
Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</b>
</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on Indeed’s Site, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.
For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through Indeed (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer.
2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer.
and 3) Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.</p>
<p>
<b>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Indeed Are Incorrect</b>
</p>
<p>In the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.
Indeed has no liability for such applications.
If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.</p>
<p>
<b>3.5 @Indeedmail Addresses</b>
</p>
<p>When communicating through Indeed’s message relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.

Such advertisements will only relate to Indeed’s services, products, and features, all of which focus on helping Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates.
If you wish to opt out of receiving any marketing messages from Indeed please see section 10.3 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>4.2 Giving You Relevant Search Results and Recommended Jobs</b>
</p>
<p>In order to optimize our services, products and features for you, Indeed may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), or application materials and answers to screener questions, to identify you and determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs or reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.
We may also use profile data to tailor your experience on the Site, to show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.
Indeed may return different results for the same search query and has full discretion with respect to the job listings it presents in response to any particular search.</p>
<p>
<b>4.3 Your Contact Information</b>
</p>
<p>When you give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and other forms of Personal and Non-Personal Data, you agree that Indeed may utilize this information for the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9, to the extent applicable.
In particular, you agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.</p>
<p>
<b>4.4 Your Resume Information</b>
</p>
<p>Your information, including Personal Data, gets placed on the Site when you upload or edit a resume, which becomes part of your Indeed Profile.
Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Data, as part of Indeed’s services.
At your direction, Indeed may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a job listing.
The extent to which your information is made available to third parties depends on the privacy settings you choose on Indeed, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When a Job Seeker creates a profile on Indeed, their resume is set to public by default, and the Job Seeker may change their resume privacy settings at any time.
This is detailed below.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Private Resumes</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Private resumes are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Public Resumes</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Public resumes are available to anyone with access to Indeed’s resume search application and may be accessed by other Indeed users, in order to increase the visibility of that resume and help Indeed find you a job.
 A public resume is also available to anyone accessing the associated URL, and to Employers whose Company Page you are following.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.
</p>
<p>If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name.
This means that third parties can view the Personal Data contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility.
If you post a public resume on Indeed, please note that although Indeed expressly prohibits the scraping of its Site any resume you post publicly is public information and the content may be copied by a third party in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>For public resumes, you also authorize Indeed to remove your name from your public resume, in certain instances. Indeed may also change the display of your resume from public to private in certain instances to maintain the quality of the resume database.</p>
<p>If you have a public resume, Indeed may use information from your resume to auto-fill all or parts of a form or application.
For example, if you use Indeed Chat, your name from your resume may appear in the messages.</p>
<p>Please note that Resume Search has not launched in all markets.
If you are located in a market where Resume Search has not yet launched, setting your resume to public will make it available to anyone who visits the associated URL.
Resumes set to public will become searchable upon the launch of Resume Search in your market.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Changing Your Resume Privacy Settings</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>When you place your resume on Indeed, it will be public by default.
You may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on Indeed.
Where you adjust your resume from public to private, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.
Additionally, Employers who have saved your resume while it was public may continue to have access to your resume even after you have adjusted it to private.</p>
<p>
<b>4.5 Matching Job Seekers With Employers</b>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, to Employers that may be interested in contacting you.
By applying to a job, answering screener questions, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or by replying to a message from an Employer, you agree to the disclosure of your information to that Employer.
Indeed may also provide the results of any Indeed Assessments you complete to Employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such an assessment.
Indeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your Indeed Resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes.</p>
<p>If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.</p>
<p>
<b>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with recruiters working for or on behalf of Employers.
If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>4.6 Sending Messages on Indeed</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products (“Relay Service”), including: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, Post a Job, Indeed Chat, Indeed Onboarding, Indeed Text2Apply, private calling, and other electronic communication services whether in the form of phone, text, video or audio.
By utilizing any Relay Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.
This includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.
Indeed may provide read receipts to the sender of a message through a Relay Service indicating that the recipient has viewed the message.</p>
<p>We process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site Rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
Examples of such improvements would be improving the open rate of messages by optimizing their delivery, optimizing our search results, improving Job Listings, permitting applicants to manage their applications after transmitting them to Indeed, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam.
As a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient.
Indeed may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event.
By using a Relay Service or otherwise providing User Content through the Site, you agree to this activity and acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of the Site and for providing the Relay Service.</p>
<p>
<b>4.7 Sending You Text Messages About Employer Appointments</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled an interview or event with you or responded to your application via Indeed’s email relay.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through Indeed’s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
To unsubscribe at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.8 Facilitating telephone relay system between Job Seekers and Employers </strong>
</p>
<p>Where applicable, Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the option to avail of a telephone relay system to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications, conducting job interviews or other communication related to a Job Listing.
Such a system uses masked or proxy telephone numbers to protect users, and is only available to users who select it on the Site.
No recording of conversations or messages is performed through this relay system, although data relating to whether a call was answered and call duration may be gathered.
Such functionality is provided to Indeed by third party service providers, such as Twilio.</p>
<p>
<b>4.9 Facilitating text messaging relay service between Job Seekers and Employers</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the ability to avail themselves of an autodialed text messaging relay service to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications and for other communications related to Job Listings.  To use this service, a Job Seeker must text an Employer’s preset keyword to a telephone number or short code that we make available on our Site or in advertising materials (such as a sign or flyer at an Employer’s place of business).  By texting the preset keyword to the telephone number or short code, you are consenting to receive text messages about the Employer’s Job Listings and as part of the application process, and acknowledge Indeed may use your personal data to submit your application to the Employer and otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
 <b>To unsubscribe at anytime from such services, reply STOP by text message to the telephone number or short code provided or contact Indeed Customer Support.  DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>4.10 Preventing Fraud and Spam</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to help diagnose problems with the Site and Indeed’s service, to prevent potentially fraudulent or illegal activities, and to protect individuals from other activities that may be detrimental to you or others.
Indeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Site; or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public; or (d) as necessary to meet national security requirements.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland, and many other regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud.
However, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur.
These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Preventing Fraud and Spam in Messages</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that Indeed determines do not adhere to Site Rules or any of the terms of this agreement.
Indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on Indeed by various means, including but not limited to investigating your functionality by setting up profiles and names that belong to Indeed.
Indeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third party if Indeed has a good faith belief that you are using the Site in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay.
This includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the Employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<b>4.11 Facilitating Payment</b>
</p>
<p>If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information). Any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.</p>
<p>
<b>4.12 Automated Processing of Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Indeed Site and services for users, Indeed performs automated processing of Personal Data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning a user’s personal preferences or interests in terms of Indeed’s Site and services.
Where it occurs, such processing is carried out if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow Indeed to provide its services to Job Seekers and Employers, including analyzing applications and resumes on behalf of Employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user’s consent.</p>
<p>For example, in certain cases such processing allows Indeed to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts and recommended jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users.
Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users, and you may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to contest any decision generated by said automated processing.</p>
<p>
<b>4.13 Sharing your Information with Indeed Affiliated Entities and Websites</b>
</p>
<p>Information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with any Indeed affiliated entity, no matter where located, to provide you with services, to improve the Site and optimize functionality on the Site, and other purposes as described in this Policy.
In particular, such sharing strengthens Indeed’s ability to help people find jobs and employers find good candidates.
The services provided to you and the functionality of the Site could not be provided without such transfers.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy, “affiliates” means any entity that directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of or with an Indeed entity, now or in the future.
“Control” for these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct management.
And this includes Indeed affiliated entities located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Such data sharing with Indeed affiliates will be performed for a number of specific reasons.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>– Improved Services</i>
</strong>
</p>
<p>It provides Job Seekers with more personalized and improved content, performance, features and services on Indeed and its affiliates’ sites.
For example, Indeed and its affiliates use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), IP address, or your resume or profile information, to determine relevant search results, Job Alerts, display and moderate career insights, such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips and more.
Such sharing is also performed to facilitate improved data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement.</p>
<p>It also allows employers to have better insight into the performance of their job postings.
For example, we may share data related to user clicks on their job postings which in turn allows them to understand how their job posting may or may not be achieving their goal of attracting candidates.
By providing employers with the information they need to better utilize our platform, they can provide stronger job postings.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>– More Employers, More Job Listings and More Job Seekers </i>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Job Seekers to access an even broader database of Job Listings and Employers, and for Employers to access more Job Seekers.
For example, this allows Indeed to recommend jobs or employers on Indeed or on websites of Indeed affiliates.
It also facilitates applications and the display of job listings from the Indeed Site to Indeed affiliates’ websites and vice versa.</p>
<p>Indeed or an Indeed affiliate is able to recommend an Indeed Job Seeker (and that Job Seeker’s resume or resume extract) to an Employer hosted by Indeed or to an Employer hosted by an Indeed affiliate.
Equally, an Indeed affiliate is able to recommend a job listing hosted by an Indeed Employer to a job seeker hosted by an Indeed affiliate.
Indeed and its affiliates can also share Employer data (such as account information and behavioral data) to provide a better experience to those Employers.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<i>– Better Security for Users</i>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Indeed and Indeed affiliates to process your Personal Data for the purpose of improving user security and internal operations, troubleshooting, and detecting and preventing fraud and spam.</p>
<p>
<b>4.14 Transfers of Information to Employers</b> </p>
<p>Indeed sends Job Seeker Personal Data to Employers on the instruction of Job Seekers.
Such transfers are performed in the course of the job search, application and interview process.
This is further described in sections 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy.
Such Personal Data will be processed in accordance with these terms and those of the relevant Employer.
Job Seekers that apply to jobs through Indeed that are outside their own country may involve sending their Personal Data to countries with lower levels of data protection.</p>
<p>Employer account holders agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules.</p>
<p>
<b>4.15 Transfers of Information to Job Seekers</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers.
This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information.
Indeed may also provide information to Job Seekers about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on Indeed in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities.
This may include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, and whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes.
As an Employer, when you use Indeed (for example by posting a Job Ad or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.</p>
<p>
<b>4.16 Transfers of Information to Service Providers </b>
</p>
<p>We may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Site and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize the services and the users’ experiences.
These service providers may have access to Personal Data in the course of providing these services, which may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries.
Such transfers are only made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable and necessary.</p>

This may include your IP address or other unique identifier, and event data related to the installation of the Indeed App.</p>
<p>This may be done for a variety of purposes, including facilitating user log-in through third party accounts.
It may also assist Indeed to understand and optimize our users’ complete customer journey by helping us: (i) understand how users arrive to Indeed.

and (iii) understand where a user has accessed Indeed through different devices.</p>
<p>When you download or install an Indeed App, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Data may be transferred to these service providers.

<p>
<b>
<i>– Storage</i>

</p>
<p>Please also be aware that we may also use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies.</p>
<p>If you are an <em>Embox</em> user, Information provided through Indeed’s <em>Embox</em> extension for the Google Chrome web browser, such as updates made regarding candidate statuses, will not be shared with third-parties for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>
<b>4.17 </b>
<strong>Transfers of Publicly Available Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When users post content on Indeed in a manner that is intended to make that content publicly available and searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties.
For example, if an Employer posts a job on Indeed, Indeed may share that job posting or information contained within that job posting with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement between Indeed and any such third parties.
Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.</p>
<p>
<b>4.18 Third-Party Sites You Link to from Indeed</b>
</p>
<p>You may also use certain third-party sites or services that you link to from Indeed’s Site.

<p>
<strong>A.
</strong>The following terms and conditions apply to all Job Seekers, Employers, Publishers and other users who access or use the Site, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1. The Indeed Services</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may make available certain Job Ads and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (such listings and other contents, (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control.
you acknowledge and understand that we have no control over Job Ads.
Some of these third parties may attempt to charge job seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. Indeed’s service, which is free to Job Seekers, links to Job Ads and has no control over any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Indeed website.
If you leave the Indeed website and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Except for certain sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.
<strong>
<i>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site for any or no reason.</i>
</strong> We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Listing or other information submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such employer or other user.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads.
You agree that Indeed may also provide search options to narrow down Job Ads search results by job type (i.e.
full-time, part-time, etc.), and such job types are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and are not a direct reflection of the actual Job Ads. Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed free for jobseekers.
Indeed ranks Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms and other activity on Indeed.</p>
<p>Please note that while this Agreement describes Indeed’s services generally, services may differ by availability, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you.
For example, while some parts of this Agreement describe matching services, Indeed does not offer any matching services in Japan.</p>
<p>
<strong>1(a) Notice to Users Applying to Jobs Through Indeed: </strong>If you are a Job Seeker, any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume or application, is subject to this Agreement (including Section 4 below) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Without limiting the foregoing, however, please note that by creating a public Indeed Resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to any Employer that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume.
By creating or uploading an Indeed Resume, Indeed may contact you to share Job Listings with you that match the contents of your Indeed Resume.
You acknowledge and agree that employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf.
When you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, such processing is an essential part of this Agreement.
To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on the use of Indeed Apply or other Indeed services.
In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event (hereinafter, all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”, “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references are referred to as “Indeed Apply”) you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to reformat the job so that you may read it more clearly in your phone, you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).
When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message.
Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties.
Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Indeed.
Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.
Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
Indeed may also send you emails from the career or hiring guides as part of its services to you.
These emails may include but not be limited to, tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, and how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired.</p>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when the Employer has scheduled interviews with you.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept  text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system. Please note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.</p>
<p>In addition, by using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s Job Ad, application form, messages, screener questions, testing assessments or their format or method of delivery and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer.
Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers.
Indeed is not responsible for the content or accessibility of Job Ads or other material provided by third-party Employers for publication.<strong> If you require </strong>
<b>alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process. </b>
</p>
<p>By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not answered the questions in a manner that the Employer so wishes, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
When you apply to a job using the Indeed Apply button, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent. <b>We cannot guarantee that such messages and </b>
<b>applications will be delivered, received, read or acted upon</b>.
The messages including applications may not be delivered, may not be received, may not be read and may not be acted upon.
In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of such contact information provided to us.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs). <b>If you do not feel</b> <b>comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having</b> <b>your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply</b> <b>or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages</b> <b>directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including</b> <b>the public mail system.
You may contact the Employer directly to find</b> <b>alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through</b> <b>Indeed.
By using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.</b> Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
Indeed may use your application materials (including public resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing. <strong>Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.
Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1(b) </strong>If you are an Employer, when you create an Indeed account, a Career Page or post a Job Listing on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of Indeed’s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you and to the Job Seekers using such Career Page or indicating an interest in such Job Listings.
 Specifically, when you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek.
By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to Mitek, you are agreeing to share your identification with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.
Indeed may have access to your identification documents via Mitek. You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with such Job Listing, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide us with.
When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Advertisements, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available certain functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate.
You agree that by using such candidate management tools, you are instructing Indeed to assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document.
You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements.When you use the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Advertisements, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add certain functions into the email.
By using these tools, you also agree that Indeed may monitor and analyze these actions.
When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, the Employer.
Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by You.
In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.
In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview.
Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.
Indeed is not responsible for the content of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal.
Indeed further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction.
If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your Employer dashboard.
You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately.
When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected”.
If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.
You agree that Indeed may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants.<strong> </strong>Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing.
You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility. If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker’s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose.<b> </b>By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.
You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
When you respond to or contact a Job Seeker who has used Indeed Resume, or Indeed Apply, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.
Additionally, you consent to Job Seekers’ applications and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.
You are responsible for the contents of any Career Page that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, including any questions for Job Seekers.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Career Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Page created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing).
Indeed may make Job Advertisement analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion.
To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.</p>

<strong>1(d) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may use application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.
Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, you agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches.

 These figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
 With respect to information regarding estimated applies, if you are an Employer participating in the Indeed Ads Program, please note that this is not the information you are purchasing from Indeed and you are not charged per apply.

You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.

<strong>) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide you an online questionnaire relating to your industry and/or your hiring or job searching needs.
Indeed may match a Job Seeker’s responses to such questionnaires to determine, on the basis of the Employer’s responses to a questionnaire about its industry and/or hiring needs, whether such Job Seeker would match the Employer’s hiring criteria as specified in the Employer’s questionnaire responses.
In the event Indeed determines that a Job Seeker matches the Employer’s hiring criteria, Indeed may connect such matching Job Seeker and Employer by sending a note informing both parties of the match, including but not limited to sending an Employer a short description of a Job Seeker taken directly from the Job Seeker’s responses to the questionnaire.
In all events you will know what data we are providing to either a Job Seeker or Employer, or upon which we relied to make the match, because you have actively submitted it.
If the Employer and Job Seeker express interest in each other, you agree Indeed may provide the Employer with an email address for the Job Seeker either provided by Indeed or the Job Seeker and, if you are a Job Seeker, you consent to this.
Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, by submitting the completed questionnaire, you agree and consent to Indeed (i) conducting such matching, utilizing only material you have submitted through the questionnaire process, (ii) presenting matching Job Seekers to Employers, and vice versa and (iii) storing and analyzing such data submitted in response to such online questionnaires.</p>

<p>Some areas of the Site, including areas that may permit you to set up an Indeed account, require you to register or provide an email address.
If you so register, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration form (including your email address) and (b) be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password, and not transfer or resell your use of or access to the Site to any third party.
Please note that any individuals with whom you have shared your username and password and who are able to answer verification questions about your Indeed account may receive access to information regarding your Indeed account.
If you are an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use.
 Indeed is not responsible and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party.
By registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding anomalous activity to your Indeed account.
If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms.
</p>
<p>In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”).
A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admin(s)”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account.
Admin(s) may be given the option to give these other users certain levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site.
If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared.
You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data and access to your account.
You agree that Indeed assumes no liability in regards to the accuracy of the statements above and that you are fully responsible for said accuracy.
When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, including but not limited to: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access.</p>
<p>We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to terminate users or to reclaim usernames or URLs.</p>
<p>You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party sources.
By providing Indeed with a mobile phone number, you expressly consent to receiving communication via such mobile number.
When you give Indeed a mobile number and consent to receiving communication, such communications are inherent to the services you have signed up for.
To revoke consent at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.
You may also revoke your consent by terminating the Agreement through closing your Indeed account.  By enabling two step verification, you verify that you are the owner of the phone number you provided.</p>

Claims of Infringement</strong>
</p>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

copyright, please contact us via our Site contact form.</p>

Indeed Resume/CV Program Terms <p>Last Updated: July 15, 2019</p>
<p>These Indeed Resume Program Terms or Indeed CV Program Terms (collectively, “IRP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Program, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Resume Program Terms.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription for, any or all of which may be modified at any time.
You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system.
Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program.
In addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed. Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services.
Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect. <strong>Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.</strong>
<strong> </strong>In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which Indeed defines as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role.
Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRP Terms, including the foregoing term.
We reserve the right to drop messages in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy, including without limitation dropping any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason.
<strong>The only acceptable use of the IRP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment.
No other uses of the IRP are permitted. </strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you.
Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Indeed Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same.
Each Resume subscription is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users.</p>
<p>
<strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones.
You agree to call Job Seekers regarding relevant job opportunities only.
It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing systems.</strong>

Indeed Ads Program Terms <p>These Indeed Ads Program Terms (“IAP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Ads Program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Ads Program Terms.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IAP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Ads Program (“Program”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Website, if you are using the Ads Program, through our on-line forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including job descriptions and screener questions) and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own and any third party’s use of your accounts.
Job Ads may be placed on (y) any content, service, or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (“Publisher”) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (“Publisher Property”).
Indeed does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution on Indeed and Publisher Properties may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations.
Sponsoring a Job Ad does not guarantee any particular distribution or placement of that or any other Job Ad.
You shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Publisher Properties.
By posting or sponsoring a Job Ad on Indeed, including but not limited to by XML feed: you agree that Indeed may and authorize Indeed to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page or in its publisher network in any way Indeed sees fit.
All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page.
In the event you provide Indeed with an indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as determined by Indeed, Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) next to the word “Sponsored” on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed.
Indeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, “Ad”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Paid”, “Promoted”, “Sponsored”, “Urgent” or similar) in connection with a sponsored advertisement on Indeed.
Job Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a certain period of time.
in some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again.
However, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a certain period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility.
Indeed may require sponsorship for the display of any Job Ad at any time for any reason.
Indeed may recommend or suggest a budget for any Job Ad to maintain its visibility.
The suggestion is made without warranty and is not a guarantee regarding placement or visibility of any Job Ad.
If you are located in Japan, you acknowledge that Indeed’s content moderation policies may, in certain instances, result in the modification of your Job Ad, and you agree to this activity. If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program.
Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue.
Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.
Indeed may offer certain Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently on the Site (“Featured Employer”).
Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend.
A Featured Employer may also receive subscriptions to the Indeed Resume Program for a limited time (“Resume Rewards”), which are awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The Featured Employer program and Resume Rewards may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.

Indeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice.
Indeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Prohibited Uses</strong>
</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks.

and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IAP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. <i>Indeed or Publishers may reject or remove any Job Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice. Although Indeed may indicate why a job or account has been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why a job or a company may be removed, and we always retain the right to remove any job, organic or sponsored, if we feel it is in our interest or our users’ interest.
For examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to Indeed’s Search Quality Policies.
Indeed may require certain Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, to improve our services, or for any other reason in Indeed’s sole discretion.
Indeed may also limit the number of free Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time in Indeed’s sole discretion.
For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.
Additionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer’s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason.
If you are a job board, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads.
For examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the Job Board Inclusion Guidelines.
As a job board, <i>you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company.
you may not post Job Ads on the Site for your client</i>
<i>s and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account.
</i>You acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation of these guidelines on the Indeed Site may harm Indeed and its users. </i>When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek.
By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to Mitek you are agreeing to share your identification with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.
Indeed may have access to your identification documents via Mitek.</p>

<p>These Indeed Assessments Terms (“IA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Indeed Assessments in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Indeed Assessments, you agree to these Indeed Assessments Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
The term “You” refers to the Candidate or the Employer in accordance with the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of certain skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Candidates (“Responses”) through the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Assessments</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Assessments as a Candidate you must create an Indeed Assessments account or log in using your preexisting Indeed Assessments account.
Account information you submit through the Site is subject to the Indeed Terms of Service and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.
Indeed may also offer you the option to select an Assessment to complete independent of a particular job, and your Response will be associated with your Indeed profile.
You may choose whether the Response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed profile, though Indeed will count the Response for purposes of generating aggregate Response statistics even if Your Response is hidden.
An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and understand that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers’ selection or use of Assessments.
You agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment and are not being asked by Indeed.
<b>You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers.</b>
<b>If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer.</b> Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</p>
<p>Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>You agree that any Assessment sent by Indeed to a Candidate is done so at your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that Candidate’s consent for Indeed to contact that Candidate for the purpose of transmitting the Assessment(s) you have selected.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Assessment to a Candidate, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Candidate will receive, access, read or respond to any Assessment, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>
<p>You agree you have made the determination to use Indeed Assessments as part of your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any Assessment or bundle of Assessments you send to a Candidate are solely being asked by you and are not being asked by Indeed.
You agree you are solely responsible for the use of Assessments and Responses in compliance with the law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes.
You are solely responsible for your use of Indeed Assessments, including without limitation any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact.” <b>You further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.</b> You acknowledge that Indeed may, but is not obligated to, provide a means by which Candidates may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from you.
Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</p>
<p>You agree that an Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by you.
You are the sole party to determine which Assessment to send to any Candidate.
Indeed reserves the right to change any Assessment or the questions asked within an Assessment at any time, for any or no reason, including but not limited to quality control.</p>
<p>Sending an Assessment to a Candidate does not guarantee a Response or any further communication or action by any Candidate.
You consent to your Assessment and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Responses</strong>
</p>
<p>A Candidate may, but is not required to, provide a Response to an Assessment sent by an Employer.
After a Candidate has provided a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.
A candidate may also have the option to select an Assessment and associate the Response with their Indeed profile, which will be visible to Employers in accordance with our Terms.
If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Candidate will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>
<p>As a Candidate, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>As a Candidate, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment, or (in the case of Assessments selected by You) to any Employer viewing Your Indeed profile.
You understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Candidates.
Indeed may aggregate the results of all Candidate-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
</p>
<p>An Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified candidate.
Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
The Employer is the sole party to determine whether to give you the opportunity to retake any Assessment sent by that Employer or update or modify your Response.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
Rules For Using Indeed Assessments</strong>
</p>

You shall not create or send any Assessment or Response containing proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).</p>
<p>Employers may not create or send any Assessment which seeks highly confidential personal information from Candidates, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of data subject to special breach notification requirements in any country.
Candidates may not create or send any Response which contains any such highly confidential personal information.</p>
<p>
<b>

</b>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
Indeed’s Role</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.
By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Candidates.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Candidates to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.
The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Candidates as applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed cannot confirm the information submitted by any Employer, Candidate, or other user, including the identity of any user.
Indeed does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of Candidates or Employers.
You are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer.
Further, for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist, Assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and do not speak to whether a Candidate is qualified for or has such a license or certification.
It is the Employer’s sole responsibility to determine what licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a Candidate has such license or certification.
Indeed also makes no statement as to whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an Employer’s sole responsibility to make such determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel to do so), in accordance with the EEOC or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.

<p>
<strong>7.

<p>These Seen by Indeed Terms (“Seen Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Seen by Indeed (“Seen”) in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Seen, you agree to these Seen by Indeed Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
The term “You” refers to the Candidate, the Employer or the Referrer, as per the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Seen by Indeed (“Seen”) is an online tool that allows Seen Employers (“Employers”) to connect with Candidate Job Seekers (“Candidates”).
The term “Candidate” will refer to users of Seen who are seeking employment opportunities through Seen.
The term “Employer” will refer to a company that is interested in using the Seen online tool to evaluate Candidates for employment.</p>
<p>Users who wish to participate in Seen as a Candidate or Employer must first apply as detailed below.
Not all users who apply to Seen will be accepted into the program, though all users who apply to Seen will remain within the Seen database regardless of acceptance, subject to our Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Candidates accepted by Indeed will be entered into the Seen Talent List of Candidates (“List”).
Employers accepted by Seen may use the Seen tool to review Candidates in the List.
Employers may choose to interview Candidates from the List and conduct a hiring process with such Candidate if they wish.
There is a charge for use of this tool to the Employers, as set forth below.
There is no charge to Candidates.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Applying to Seen by Indeed</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidate:</p>
<p>In order to use Seen as a Candidate you must create an Indeed account or login using your preexisting Indeed account, create a profile, and apply.
When applying to Seen, we may require you to provide us with additional information, such as your name, email address, phone number, skill set, salary requirements and geographic location.
At this stage, you may have the opportunity to block your profile from certain Employers, though Indeed cannot guarantee that such Employers will never be able to view your Seen profile.
We will use the information that you provide us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Seen by Indeed.
You agree that such a determination may be made on the basis of automated decision making.
We may use a third party vendor to help us review your application.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to use Seen. </p>
<p>If you are accepted into Seen, we will notify you via email.
Once you have been accepted, a member of the Seen Talent Team (“Talent Consultant”) may reach out to you via the email address or phone number you provided, and work with you to finalize your Candidate profile.
Please note that although Seen may suggest ways to help highlight your qualifications, you retain responsibility for the content, truth, and accuracy of your profile.
The Talent Consultant may continue to work with you throughout your time on Seen. </p>
<p>If you are not accepted into Seen, you will be notified via email and your profile will remain within the Seen database as a private, non-searchable profile, which may be sent to Employers that Seen believes may be interested in you.</p>
<p>Employer:</p>
<p>In order to use Seen as an Employer you must also apply.
Applying to be an Employer is free.
When applying we may ask you for additional information related to your company, including but not limited to, your name, email address, company URL, phone number and geographic location.
We will review the information that you provided to us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Seen.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to Seen.
If your application is accepted, you will be notified via email and allowed to use the Seen online tool so as to engage with, and reach out to Candidates that are available in the Seen List.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Talent List</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>After a Candidate has applied and been accepted to Seen, he or she will be placed into the List to be viewed by Employers using the Seen tool.
Candidates will remain in the List for such a time as determined by Indeed, as per Indeed rules.
Employers will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates in the List.
Candidates may receive emails from Employers informing them of their interest in the Candidate, and providing them details about the job solicitation.
Indeed has no input into the Employer’s selection process.
Employers may be able to share Candidate profile information.
A Candidate may, but is not required to, respond to any Employer that has contacted him or her.
All requests for interviews by Employers through Seen do not guarantee a final job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary.</p>
<p>Indeed may refer to Candidates in the List with certain descriptors such as “new,” “active,” or “passive,” which may be selected by the Candidate or may be based on the Candidate’s activity on Indeed.
For example, if a Candidate stops using the Seen platform, after a period of time Indeed may label such a Candidate as “passive” until they use the Seen platform again.
Some Employers may not be shown passive Candidates in search results, depending on the Employer’s subscription to Seen.
In addition, Indeed may remove any Candidate from the List, at any time, for any reason, in Indeed’s sole discretion.
A removed Candidate may reapply through their Talent Consultant for consideration to be reentered into the List.
The re-application process is at Indeed’s sole discretion, and not all re-applications will be granted.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>After an Employer’s application has been accepted by Seen, the Employer will be able to use the Seen tool in order to browse the Candidates in the List, communicate with these Candidates, and submit interview requests to Candidates.
Employer acknowledges and agrees that all Candidate information in the List is provided by Candidates only, and that Indeed cannot vouch for the accuracy or truth of Candidate profiles.
Seen does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or attempt to verify the identity or statements of Candidates.
Employers are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that may be required before making an offer of employment to a Candidate.
Employers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Employer through the use of Seen.
The Candidate is not obligated to accept any offer from an Employer that contacts them through Seen.
Additionally, offers or interview requests submitted by an Employer to a Candidate through Seen are not binding on the Employer.
Employer agrees that Indeed is entitled to publish the details of all non-binding offers made and the identity of those parties that have made such offers, unless the Employer has elected to remain anonymous.
Indeed may associate Candidates in the List with certain descriptors such as “new,” “active,” or “passive,” or similar words.
These descriptors may be selected by the Candidate or they may be based on a Candidate’s activity on Indeed, and do not guarantee a candidate’s interest level in any job or Employer.</p>
<p>Employer agrees not to attempt to circumvent Seen by attempting to contact a Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Seen.</p>
<p>Indeed’s Role:</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agent by providing the Seen product.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Candidates and Employers to connect with each other.
Candidates and Employers are solely responsible for the information provided in any resume or profile, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Seen.</p>
<p>You understand that Seen does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of Candidates or Employers, and that you are responsible for (1) conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer, and (2) complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a party to, beneficiary of, or liable for, any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
You agree that Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>

Applicants represent and warrant that all information submitted to Indeed is true, accurate and complete.
Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant for participation in the Program or any part thereof.
If you are accepted as a Seen Ambassador, we will notify you via email.
Please note that certain aspects of the Seen Ambassador Program may be managed by a service provider or other third party.
Such service provider may display information and statistics regarding the Ambassador Program, but the final determination of such information will be made by Indeed.
For example, the service provider may provide a dashboard showing the current number of Candidate referrals, but the final number of such referrals is subject to revision due to factors such as the discovery of duplicates, incorrect information, fraud, or other reasons determined by Indeed.</p>

Indeed Targeted Ads Terms <p>Last Updated: July 15, 2019</p>
<p>These Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (“ITA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Targeted Ads program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ITA Terms.
 These ITA Terms apply to both of Indeed’s Targeted Ads Services: 1) Indeed Targeted Ads: Brand (“ITA Brand”) and 2) Indeed Targeted Ads: Apply (“ITA Apply”).</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ITA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong>
<b> The Program</b>
</p>
<p>Use of Indeed Targeted Ads (“ITA”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Site, and, if you are using ITA, through our online forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed through ITA, (“Targeted Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you.
including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
Targeted Ads may be placed on any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”).
By posting a Targeted Ad on Indeed, you authorize Indeed to reformat the Job Ad to be effectively displayed on a mobile device.
Target audience membership is based partly on information and criteria provided by the Employer, but the composition of each target audience is determined by Indeed in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<b>ITA Apply</b>: In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to your post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”).
The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed.
However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement.
Any removal of the tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle to Indeed to any resulting damages.
 It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place.
The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include certain application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process.
If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed to the next stage of the application process, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.
You further acknowledge that your use of these application questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool and that Indeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these application questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers’ answers to your application questions.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong>
<b> Cancellation</b>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any Targeted Ad at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
Indeed may cancel ITA or these ITA Terms at any time.
Indeed may modify ITA or these ITA Terms at any time without liability, and your use of ITA after notice that these ITA Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated ITA Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these ITA Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong>
<b> Prohibited Uses</b>
</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions, applies, or clicks.
or (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Targeted Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these ITA Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.
<b>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Targeted Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</b>
</p>
<p>

Applies are defined as a user visit to the agreed upon Post-Apply Page listed in any separate agreement (including via email exchange) or insertion order between you and Indeed.
Impressions are defined as an ad appearing on a page of the Site, which page has been presented to a Job Seeker.
However, an Impression does not guarantee that a Job Seeker has viewed such ad.
If you are an Employer using ITA Brand, your price per Impression found on any ITA Brand Insertion Order is defined as the cost per 1000 impressions.
<b>If your ITA Insertion Order does not contain an end date, you will continue to be billed until you contact Indeed and request to be removed from the ITA Program.</b> If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Targeted Ads.

 If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais.

This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion.
Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT.
You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate.
You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts.
If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services.
You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights).
<b>Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Apply measurements, click measurements, or Impressions measurements.
Indeed’s determination of number of Applies, clicks or Impressions shall be binding.</b> Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property.
You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.
Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore.

Indeed Hiring Events Program Terms <p>Last Updated: August 13, 2019</p>
<p>These Indeed Hiring Events Program Terms (“IHEP Terms”) incorporate the Indeed Terms of Service, and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Hiring Events Program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Hiring Events Program Terms.
By agreeing to the IHEP Terms, you also agree to the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IHEP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Hiring Events Program (“Program”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Site.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.</p>
<p>By using the Program and accepting these IHEP Terms you acknowledge and agree that you are asking Indeed to do the following: 1) post, on your behalf, Job Listings or Job Ads, as applicable, provided by you on the Site, and manage such ad campaign, using information such as the number of RSVPs, 2) include an RSVP function on the Site for a hiring event (“Event”) corresponding with each of your Job Ads or Listings, 3) receive from Job Seekers RSVPs to your Event(s), 4) send to you and/or other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to your Event(s), and 5) communicate (via email or text message) information related to your Event(s) to Job Seekers who have RSVPed to your Event(s).
If you request that Indeed send you and other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to the Event(s), you certify and warrant that such person is part of your organization or is otherwise authorized to receive such information.</p>
<p>With regards to any Job Ad posted on Indeed via the Program, including any Job Ad of your Event posted in Indeed’s discretion, you agree that such Job Ad shall be subject to the Indeed Ads Program terms (https://www.indeed.com/legal#indeedAdsTerms) and the Indeed Targeted Ads Program terms (https://www.indeed.com/legal#indeedTargetedAdsTerms), and the Indeed Ads Program terms and Indeed Targeted Ads Program terms are incorporated herein.</p>
<p>You further agree that you are solely responsible for everything regarding your Event(s), including but not limited to, the content of the Job Listing or Job Ad, screening or screener questions, the handling and safeguarding of Job Seeker information provided to you and/or other persons you identify as authorized to receive information regarding an Event or a Job Seeker, the Event location, your attendees at the Event, or any literature, signage or other documentation at the event.
You represent and warrant that any data you collect from attendees and share with Indeed is collected in accordance with local privacy rules.
Moreover, you grant to Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees the license to use your name, user name, and/or trademarks and logos in connection with any User Content or Indeed marketing materials, or actions by Indeed to promote or publicize such User Content (e.g.
Job Listings) including the use of keywords in third-party internet search engine.
You agree that Indeed may promote your Job Listing or Job Ad through any method in Indeed’s sole discretion, including but not limited to targeted advertising or using keywords in third-party internet search engine.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel any Job Listing or Job Ad (and corresponding Event) at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
However, if you cancel an Event, Indeed will still bill you in accordance with any pricing listed in a separate agreement or otherwise agreed upon by you and Indeed, for RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions accrued while the Job Ad for that Event was on the Site, and any platform fee, if applicable.
Indeed may reach out to Job Seekers to communicate your Event cancellation.
Indeed may immediately cancel the Program, any part thereof, or these IHEPP Terms at any time upon notice.
Indeed may modify the Program or these IHEP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Program after notice that these IHEP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IHEP Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IHEP Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Prohibited Uses</strong>
</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize or assist any party to, advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities or business practices in any state or country where your Job Listing or Job Ad is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information and any and all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute, and display Job Listings or Job Ads (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Listings or Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IHEP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. <strong>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Job Listing, Job Ad, or content therein, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</strong>

<p>You shall be charged in accordance with the pricing listed in a separate agreement or insertion order between you and Indeed, and based on clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions (distributed within your budget in Indeed’s sole discretion) and platform fee, if applicable.
RSVPs are defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event featured in any Job Ad.
However, an RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend such Event.
If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program or any other Indeed service, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Hiring Events RSVPs, if applicable.</p>
<p>If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all applicable charges in US dollars.
If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees.
If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais.
If your billing address is in the Asia-Pacific Region*, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars.

Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT.
You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate.
You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts.
If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services.
You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). <strong>Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click, RSVP, apply, or impression measurements.
Indeed’s determination of number of clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions shall be binding.</strong> Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property.
If you are removed from Indeed, but have previously spent on Indeed, you are not entitled to a refund of previously spent amounts.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.
Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.</p>
<p>All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore.
Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail.
To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.</p>
