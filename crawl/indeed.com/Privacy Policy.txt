</p>
<p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the web sites of Indeed (referred to in this policy as "we", "us" or "our").
"Cookies" are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive or other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the web site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Like most web sites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your on line experience.
Two types of cookies are used on this website:
</p>
<p>
Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site
</p>
<p>
Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the site to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.
Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows Explorer:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open 'Windows Explorer'</li>
<li>Click on the 'Search' button on the tool bar</li>
<li>Type "cookie" into the search box for 'Folders and Files'</li>
<li>Select 'My Computer' in the 'Look In' box</li>
<li>Click 'Search Now'</li>
<li>Double click on the folders that are found</li>
<li>'Select' any cookie file</li>
<li>Hit the 'Delete' button on your keyboard</li>
</ol> If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select "cookies" in the "Help" function for information on where to find your cookie folder If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this web site.
<p>
Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers.
Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Indeed web sites.
This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.
</p>
<p>
You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
To provide web site visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs.

<p>
<b>Claims of Copyright Infringement</b>
</p>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Indeed Copyright Notice, 177 Broad Street, 6th Floor, Stamford, CT, 06901 (copyright @ indeed.com).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
