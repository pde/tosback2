<strong>Indeed’s Full Privacy Policy</strong>
<strong> 1.
Introduction</strong>
<p>Indeed values the trust our users and customers place in us when they give us access to their Personal Data.
The Privacy Policy describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect that information.</p>
<p>Effective December 2020, the brands covered by this Privacy Policy include: Indeed, Engineerjobs, Careesma, Gigajob, Workopolis and Wowjobs (collectively “the Sites” or “our Sites”). </p>
<p>In particular, this Privacy Policy details our collection, use and disclosure of personal and non-personal data you give to Indeed when you access or use Indeed’s or the other Sites’ online and/or mobile services, mobile applications and websites, and software provided by Indeed while using these services or websites. Our core mission is to help people get jobs, and help Employers find great candidates.
Since each of our affiliates shares this core mission, we developed a Privacy Center as a way of educating our users about our affiliates, and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users.
You can find out more about how we share data between affiliates on our Privacy Center FAQ page.</p>
<strong>1.1 The Indeed Entities Responsible for Your Information</strong>
<p>This section determines which Indeed entity acts as the controller of your Personal Data. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Indeed”, “we” or “us” means Indeed, Inc.

<p>Indeed is the controller of all Personal Data processed pursuant to this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise provided for in a separate agreement.</p>

<strong>1.2 <strong>Some Important Definitions</strong>
</strong>
<p>Personal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual.
Please note that at all times Indeed will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.</p>
<p>The Sites are made available for use only by individuals searching for employment openings, or services or information related to their personal employment or job search (“Job Seekers”).
Where applicable, the Sites may also be made available to individuals and/or organizations seeking information related to hiring or human resources or seeking to make available information regarding employment openings (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), on their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties (“Employers”).</p>
<strong>1.3 The Scope of Indeed’s Privacy Policy</strong>

<p>Occasionally, we may refer to this Privacy Policy in notices on the Sites, including special purpose web pages or mobile applications, including invitations for you to submit ideas to improve the Sites.
Indeed may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.</p>

<strong> 2.
Information Collected</strong>
<p>You provide different types of information in order for Indeed to provide our Sites’ services, products and features to you. </p>
<strong>2.1 Information You Provide to Indeed</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– From Your Account</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect data from you when you create an account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Indeed Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Sites.
This may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Indeed or to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you.
This information may be associated with your profile. </p>
<p>You may provide your specific location data when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps (as defined in the Indeed Terms of Service Introduction) to help you find more relevant Job Listings.
Indeed seeks your consent at the time of such provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured. </p>
<p>If you create an Indeed account, Indeed may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code.
For example, while using a mobile device to access Indeed, Indeed may provide a Job Seeker with relevant Job Listings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Through Your Activity on the Sites</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Sites, Indeed may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Sites, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, your salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), the Job Listings you apply to, the date, time and type of your activity on the Sites such as how often you update your resume or look for jobs, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, mobile device advertising identifier, MAC address, IP address, and any of your other behavior on the Sites.</p>
<p>For Employers, this may also include actions taken with regard to a Job Listing or to Job Seeker’s resume or application, such as pausing or closing a Job Listing, opening, viewing or responding to a resume or application, or making a decision with regard to a resume, application or Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Through Your Activity on Indeed Hire</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Employers may be contacted to take advantage of our Indeed Hire service, in which case you may provide Indeed with additional information about hiring needs.
This allows Indeed to determine whether or not our Hire product is suitable for an Employer’s needs.
When Job Seekers apply for a job recommended to them by Indeed Hire, Indeed facilitates certain aspects of the recruitment process including, for example, negotiations between the Job Seeker and the Employer, as applicable.
As such, we collect and process any information submitted to Indeed through this process, including but not limited to any queries a Job Seeker may have about the job or interview, information about progression through the recruitment process and information relating to salary.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When Using Automated Phone Screening</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.
Where you wish to use such a product, you will agree in advance to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When Providing Employer Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an Employer, we may request that you provide certain information in order to verify your account.
This information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.
This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>–</em>
<em>When Using Chargeable Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers and related verification information).
Please note that Indeed only has access to the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers, and does not store full card numbers or related card security codes.</p>
<strong>2.2 Information Collected When You Apply for Jobs or Access Indeed from Some Third-Party Websites</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When You Log In or Use Indeed from Some Third-Party Sites</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google.
If you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.
If you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Indeed.
Please note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.</p>
<p>By accessing Indeed through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed in the above paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access Indeed in a secure manner.
You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account.
This information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of Indeed.</p>
<p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account.
Facebook or Google may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.
Once you give this permission, the requested information will be shared with Indeed.
This information will be used to provide services to you, including populating your Indeed profile on Indeed.
The shared information will remain associated with your Indeed profile until you modify or delete it.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Indeed for Chrome and Our Mobile Software</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also collect information about third-party websites you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome.
This could include information about Job Listings, notes or application statuses that you submit, save, or update, or data regarding how you engage with websites or other actions you take on such websites, including URLs of websites you visit.
We may also suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in applications you submit on third-party sites and see whether you make changes to these suggestions but not the changes themselves.
We do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application on a third-party site to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application.
Indeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved Job Listing searches, Job Listing recommendations and product features. </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<strong>
<em>– When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Websites</em>
</strong>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you apply for a job on certain third-party Websites, Indeed may also receive information about the status of your job application and the decisions taken by the Employer such as whether the application reached the interview stage and whether a job offer was accepted or rejected.
This information helps Indeed further understand the effectiveness of our Sites and its features.
Indeed’s use of this information is detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<strong>
<em>
<strong>
<em>– Indeed IQ</em>
</strong>
</em>
</strong>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed provides a programmatic campaign optimizer tool which helps Employers manage, track and optimize the performance of their advertising across a multitude of job advertising sites and platforms in real-time (“Indeed IQ”).
When you click on a Job Listing powered by Indeed IQ, and when you start and complete a job application generated by Indeed IQ on an Employer’s website or a website operated by an Employer’s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.
The information collected includes, for example, information about your device, Job Listings viewed/clicked, job applications started and completed, referring URLs and dates and times of site visits. </p>
<strong>2.3 Any Other Personal Data Indeed May Receive from Third Parties</strong>
<p>Any Personal Data that Indeed may obtain from other third-party sources, including data from sponsored advertisements that we have on third party sites, will be processed by Indeed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p>
<strong>2.4 Storage of Your Information</strong>
<p>Indeed stores your Personal Data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services or until you ask us to delete your Personal Data.
As one example, if an Employer deletes a job application in their candidate dashboard on Indeed, Indeed may delete information associated with that application.
As another example, after an application has been delivered to an Employer, Indeed may retain a copy of that application for a limited time and then delete the copy.
We are also required to retain certain information in order to comply with local laws.</p>
<p>Indeed may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with.
Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p>
<strong>2.5 What Personal Data is Required</strong>
<p>It will be indicated to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Indeed services or features to you.
Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p>
<strong>2.6 The Legal Basis on Which Indeed Collects Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>Indeed collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Performance of a Contract</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of the Personal Data processed by Indeed is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
An example of this would be where Indeed sends a Job Seeker’s application to an Employer.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Legitimate Interest</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed or an Employer.
Examples of such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention, or where we share your Personal Data with Indeed affiliates as detailed in section 4.14 below.
Indeed will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Compliance with a Legal Obligation</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Indeed to comply with a legal obligation.
An example of this would be where Indeed is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Consent</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Indeed relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.
Where Indeed requires your consent, we seek it at the time of provision, and the processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
For example, your consent will be sought in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message such as a Job Alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy).
You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy where applicable, or by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<strong> 3.
Limitations of Use </strong>
<strong>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</strong>
<p>When a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, Job Alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again.
Please also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to some of our products and the ability to utilize the “log in with Indeed” feature found on certain third party sites.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement).
A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account.
When the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<strong>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Disable an Employer Account</strong>
<p>Employers may disable an account at any time by contacting Indeed Customer Support.
Please note that Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.
Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<strong>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</strong>
<p>If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on the Sites, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.
For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through the Sites (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer and 2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer.</p>
<strong>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Indeed Are Incorrect</strong>
<p>Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.
In the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.
Indeed has no liability for such applications.
If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.</p>
<strong>3.5 @Indeedmail Addresses</strong>
<p>When communicating through Indeed’s message relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.
You understand that you retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers’ Job Listings, but are owned by Indeed.
However, Indeed’s relay system will show the name associated with your account or job application in the “To:” or “From:” field.
In addition, the above shall apply to any email addresses added to a thread when communicating via Indeed’s message relay system.
Specifically, if you choose to add additional recipients to an ongoing email thread through Indeed’s message relay system, the additional recipient(s) will also be assigned @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com addresses as well.
Please note that emails which include an email address ending in @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com will be stored on our systems.
You should not send a message to an email address ending in @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com if you do not wish for this to happen.</p>
<p>Please also note that since these message proxy and relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.</p>
<strong>3.6 Minimum Age of our Users</strong>
<p>The Sites are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
However if local laws provide for an alternative minimum age for the provision of the Sites’ services to you, then that shall apply as the applicable minimum age.
In all jurisdictions outside the European Union, if you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian or responsible adult.</p>
<p>We adopt a range of measures to try to ensure that we do not accept individuals who do not meet the minimum age and any other applicable age requirements.
If you do not satisfy these age requirements, please email privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<strong> 4.
Purposes, Uses and Disclosures of Information</strong>
<p>We may use any information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.
Indeed associates Personal Data with your Job Seeker profile in order to perform the activities described in this Privacy Policy.
Indeed uses such information to help Job Seekers find jobs and to help Employers find candidates.
In order to do this we use your Personal Data to:</p>
<ol>
<li>provide our services, products and features to you, to help Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates;</li>
<li>to measure and improve those services, products and features.
and</li>
<li>to protect our users and provide them with customer support.</li>
</ol>
<p>More detail on these purposes, uses and disclosures of your information is set out below.</p>
<strong>4.1 Creating an Account, Sending You Job Alerts and Other Promotional Materials</strong>
<p>If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Indeed may use the information you provide to Indeed, including your contact information, to (i) create an account.
(ii) send you Job Alerts.
(iii) send you Invitations to Apply for a job through Indeed Hire and (iv) send you information about the Sites, including by displaying our promotional materials to you on third-party sites.
Indeed may use third-party partners to perform these activities on Indeed’s behalf.</p>
<p>A Job Alert is an email that you sign up for containing Job Listings in response to a search query you have run.
A company alert is one type of Job Alert which contains Job Listings and other information you have requested regarding a company.
Job Alerts may also include jobs that are recommended for you, Indeed Targeted Ads, companies you may be interested in following, or other actions you may want to take on the Sites.
The frequency of Job Alerts may be adjusted by Indeed on the Sites.</p>
<p>An Invitation to Apply is an email sent to you inviting you to apply for a job through Indeed Hire, Indeed’s optimized hiring and recruitment service.
If Indeed Hire is available in your location, Indeed may send you an Invitation to Apply based on your previous job search and application history on Indeed, and any information, including Personal Data, you upload to the Site. </p>
<p>We may also use your information in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you on third-party websites.
Such advertisements will only relate to the Sites services, products, and features, all of which focus on helping Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates.
If you wish to opt out of receiving any marketing messages from the Sites, please see section 10.3 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<strong>4.2 Giving You Relevant Search Results and Recommended Jobs</strong>
<p>In order to optimize our services, products and features for you, we may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), or application materials and answers to screener questions, to identify you, determine relevant search results and reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.
We may also use profile data to tailor your experience on the Sites and to display content according to your preferences.
We may return different results for the same search query and have full discretion with respect to the Job Listings we present in response to any particular search.
In the event that you have applied to a job that is being serviced by Indeed Hire product, Indeed may invite you to apply for additional roles.</p>
<strong>4.3 Your Contact Information</strong>
<p>When you give the Sites contact information (such as your name and email address) and other forms of Personal and Non-Personal Data, you agree that we may utilize this information for the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9, to the extent applicable.
In particular, you agree that we may, as part of our services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), text message or postal mail.
This includes communication through the use of contact information that you may provide to us or that we may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.
Should you apply to a job that is supported by our Indeed Hire product, a Hiring Specialist may use your contact information to conduct or coordinate interviews with you, and provide you with updates throughout the hiring process.
We may also analyze our users’ contact information in the aggregate to better understand our users and improve our products and services.</p>
<strong>4.4 Your Resume Information</strong>
<p>Your information, including Personal Data, gets placed on the Sites when you upload or edit a resume, which becomes part of your Job Seeker profile.
We reserve the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Data, as part of the Sites’ services.
At your direction, we may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a Job Listing.
We may also use information in your Job Seeker profile to offer suggestions to you when you apply for jobs on third party websites in our mobile software.
The extent to which your information is made available to third parties depends on the privacy settings you choose, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When a Job Seeker creates a profile on Indeed, their resume is set to public by default, and the Job Seeker may change their resume privacy settings at any time.
This is detailed below.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Private Resumes</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Private resumes are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Public Resumes</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Public resumes may be available to anyone accessing our Site. This includes users of Indeed’s Resume Search product, Employers whose Company Page you may be following, and anyone with access to the URL associated with your public resume, such as search engines and other third parties that may crawl our Site. We offer you this visibility to help you find a job. </p>
<p>When you make your resume public (or upload a file as your resume and set it to public) on our Site, you authorize Indeed to share the contents of your resume, including your name and any other Personal Data that you may include in it, publicly on the Site.  </p>
<p>Our Resume Search product allows Employers to find great candidates by searching public resumes. By posting a public resume, you authorize Indeed to make your entire public resume available to any user who searches for you on our Site, and to allow employers to see if you were recently active on the Sites, your readiness to work, and your available contact methods. If you upload a file as your resume and set it to public, you authorize Indeed to extract the contents of this file and share them on our Site, including within our Resume Search product. We may remove your name and contact information from your public resume in certain instances, such as for users of our Resume Search product without a subscription.
Employers who have subscribed to our Resume Search product will be able to see your name, but we remove your contact information until you express interest in an Employer. In either case, Employers may still contact you through our Site using our Relay Service.
You also authorize Indeed to share any file you upload as your resume and set to public with Employers where you express interest in them.</p>
<p>Indeed expressly prohibits all scraping of its Site, although some third parties may use our Site in violation of these terms to obtain your public resume information.</p>
<p>Please note that Resume Search has not launched in all markets.
If you are located in a market where Resume Search has not yet launched, setting your resume to public may make it available to anyone who visits the associated URL but it may not be searchable on our Site.
Resumes set to public in markets where Resume Search is not yet available may become searchable upon our launch of Resume Search in that market.</p>
<p>Indeed may also provide browser extensions and other tools to help Employers better interact with Job Seekers and their resume information, including tools that allow Employers to download your resume information and enhance and transfer it to third parties engaged to process information on their behalf, such as applicant tracking systems and other recruitment management tools.  Employers are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws that relate to their use of information obtained from Indeed and other sources, including any obligations Employers may have to restrict how others interact with resume information downloaded from our Site.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Changing Your Resume Privacy Settings</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you place your resume on Indeed, it will be set to public by default.
You may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on Indeed.
Where you adjust your resume from public to private, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.
Additionally, Employers who have saved your resume while it was public may continue to have access to your resume even after you have adjusted it to private.</p>
<strong>4.5 Matching Job Seekers With Employers</strong>
<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Sites or any of our other products or services (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, to Employers that may be interested in contacting you.
By applying to a job, answering screener questions, providing your contact information to show interest in a Job Listing, using Indeed Hire, or by replying to a message from an Employer, such as by expressing your interest in a particular Job Listing, you agree to the disclosure of your information to that Employer.
Indeed may also provide the results of any Indeed Assessments you complete to Employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such an assessment.
Indeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes.</p>
<p>If you have an account or a hosted resume, you agree that we may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your activity on Indeed.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about you with recruiters working for or on behalf of Employers.
If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your resume to private.</p>
<strong>4.6 Optimizing Job Campaigns</strong>
<p>When Job Seekers click on a Job Listing or apply for a job powered by Indeed IQ on our Sites or on a third-party website, including an Employer’s website or a website operated by an Employer’s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information through this feature about Job Seekers and any actions taken while on the Sites, as detailed in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy.
Indeed uses this information to help us understand the effectiveness of our Sites and to ensure that Job Listings powered by Indeed IQ perform at the optimal level on our Sites and on other third-party websites.</p>
<strong>4.7 Sending Messages on Indeed</strong>
<p>Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products (“Relay Service”), including, but not limited to: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, Post a Job, Indeed Chat, Indeed Onboarding, Indeed Text2Apply, Indeed Community, private calling, and other electronic communication services whether in the form of phone, text, video or audio.
By utilizing any Relay Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.
This includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.
Indeed may provide read receipts to the sender of a message through a Relay Service indicating that the recipient has viewed the message.
Indeed may also separately inform the sender and recipient of a message through a Relay Service whether the sender or recipient recently has been active on the Site.</p>
<p>We process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content, which may include Personal Data, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Sites or any other Indeed product or service.
Examples of such improvements would be improving the open rate of messages by optimizing their delivery, optimizing our search results, improving Job Listings, permitting applicants to manage their applications after transmitting them to Indeed, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam.
Some of this activity is performed on Indeed’s behalf by service providers, as described in the section of this Privacy Policy titled ‘Transfers of Information to Service Providers’.
As a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient.
Indeed may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event.
By using a Relay Service or otherwise providing User Content through the Site, you agree to this activity and acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of the Sites and for providing the Relay Service.</p>
<strong>4.8 Sending You Text Messages About Employer Appointments</strong>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled an interview or event with you, when an Employer seeks to contact you based on your public resume, or has responded to your application via Indeed’s email relay.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form.
By entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through Indeed’s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
To unsubscribe at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.
Replying STOP in response to an Indeed SMS alert will unsubscribe you from all Indeed SMS alerts except those related to Text2Apply and Hiring Events.
In order to unsubscribe from those products, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those products.</p>
<strong>4.9 Facilitating telephone relay system between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>
<p>Where applicable, Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the option to use a telephone relay system to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications, conducting job interviews or other communication related to a Job Listing.
Such a system uses masked or proxy telephone numbers to protect users, and is only available to users who select it on the Site.
No recording of conversations or messages is performed through this relay system, although data relating to whether a call was answered and call duration may be gathered.
Such functionality is provided to Indeed by third party service providers, such as Twilio.</p>
<strong>4.10 Facilitating text messaging relay service between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>
<p>Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the ability to utilize an autodialed text messaging relay service to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications and for other communications related to Job Listings.
To use this service, a Job Seeker must text an Employer’s preset keyword to a telephone number or short code that we make available on our Sites or in advertising materials (such as a sign or flyer at an Employer’s place of business).
By texting the preset keyword to the telephone number or short code, you are consenting to receive text messages about the Employer’s Job Listings and as part of the application process, and acknowledge Indeed may use your Personal Data to submit your application to the Employer and otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
To unsubscribe at any time from such services, reply STOP by text message to the telephone number or short code provided or contact Indeed Customer Support.
DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS.</p>
<strong>4.11 Preventing Fraud and Spam</strong>
<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to help diagnose problems with the Sites and our products and services, to prevent potentially fraudulent or illegal activities, and to protect individuals from other activities that may be detrimental to you or others.
Indeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders.
(b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Sites.
or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public.
or (d) as necessary to meet national security requirements.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland, and many other regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud.
However, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur.
These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Preventing Fraud and Spam in Messages</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that we determine do not adhere to the Sites’ rules or any of the terms of our terms of service.
Indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on the Sites by various means.
Indeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third parties if we have a good faith belief that you are using the Sites in violation of this Privacy Policy or the applicable terms of service.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay.
This includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the Employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant Job Listing.</p>
<strong>4.12 Facilitating Payment</strong>
<p>If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, we will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information).
Any credit, debit, or other payment card and related billing and payment information that you provide to us may be shared by us with companies who work on our behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment and servicing your account.</p>
<strong>4.13 Automated Processing of Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Sites, we perform automated processing of Personal Data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user.
In particular we use automated processing to analyze or predict a user’s personal preferences or interests.
Where it occurs, such processing is carried out if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow us to provide our services to Job Seekers and Employers, including analyzing applications and resumes on behalf of Employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user’s consent.</p>
<p>For example, in certain cases such processing allows us to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and Invitations to Apply to jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users.
Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users.
You may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to contest any decision generated by said automated processing.</p>
<strong>4.14 Sharing your Information with Our Affiliates </strong>
<p>Our core mission is to help Job Seekers find great jobs, and Employers find great candidates, which is a mission we share with each of our affiliates.
In order to support that mission, we share certain information with our affiliates.
Such information sharing is governed by this Privacy Policy.
We also developed the Privacy Center as a way of educating our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users.
We encourage you to visit the Privacy Center to learn more.</p>
<p>Information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with an affiliated entity to provide you with services, to improve the Sites and optimize functionality on the Sites, and other purposes as described in this Policy.
In particular, such sharing strengthens our ability to help Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find great candidates.
The services provided to you and the functionality of the Sites could not be provided without such transfers.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use the Sites.</p>
<p>Examples of our affiliates include: Glassdoor, SimplyHired, Indeed Flex/Syft, Resume.com, RescueMyResumes.com and Resumeperfector.com. Such data sharing with Indeed affiliates will be performed for a number of specific reasons and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Policies of those affiliates.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Improved Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Data sharing with affiliates provides Job Seekers with more personalized and improved content, performance, features and services.
For example, Indeed and its affiliates use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), IP address, or your resume or profile information, to determine relevant search results, Job Alerts, display and moderate career insights, such as company reviews, Job Listing salary data, interview tips and more.
Such sharing is also performed to facilitate improved data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement.</p>
<p>This sharing also allows Employers to have better insight into the performance of their Job Listings.
For example, we may share data related to user clicks on their Job Listings which in turn allows Employers to understand the extent to which they are attracting candidates.
By providing Employers with the information they need to better utilize our platform, they can provide stronger Job Listings.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– More Employers, More Job Listings and More Job Seekers</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Job Seekers to access an even broader database of Job Listings and Employers, and for Employers to access more Job Seekers.
For example, this allows Indeed to recommend jobs or Employers on our Sites or on websites of our affiliates.
It also facilitates applications and the display of Job Listings from the Sites to affiliates’ websites and vice versa.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed and its affiliates recommend a Job Seeker to an Employer, and a Job Listing to a Job Seeker.
This applies to Job Seekers, Employers and Job Listings on Indeed and any of its affiliates.
Indeed and its affiliates also share Employer data (such as account information and behavioral data) to provide a better experience to those Employers.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Better Security for Users</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Indeed and our affiliates to process your Personal Data for the purpose of improving user security and internal operations, troubleshooting, and detecting and preventing fraud and spam.</p>
<strong>4.15 Transfers of Information to Employers </strong>
<p>Indeed sends Job Seeker Personal Data to Employers on the instruction of Job Seekers.
Such transfers are performed in the course of the job search, application and interview process.
This is further described in sections 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy.
Such Personal Data will be processed in accordance with these terms and those of the relevant Employer.
Job Seekers that apply to jobs through Indeed that are outside their own country may involve sending their Personal Data to countries with lower levels of data protection.</p>
<p>Employer account holders agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules.</p>
<strong>4.16 Transfers of Information to Job Seekers</strong>
<p>Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers.
This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on the Sites and publishing Job Listings on third-party websites.
Indeed may also provide information to Job Seekers about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on the Sites in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities.
This may include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken an action with regard to the Job Seeker’s resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it.
As an Employer, when you use the Sites (for example by posting a Job Listing or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.</p>
<strong>4.17 Transfers of Information to Service Providers </strong>
<p>We may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Sites and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize the services and the users’ experiences.
These service providers may have access to Personal Data in the course of providing these services, which may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries.
Such transfers are made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>– <strong>
<em>Improving our Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>These third parties may provide data points including how much time you spend on specific pages, which links you choose to click, and data that helps determine user preferences.
This information enables us to build and maintain our services with user feedback.
These third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect data on your behavior and devices such as the device type, browser information, and preferred language.
An example of one of these third parties is Hotjar. </p>
<p>– <strong>
<em>Maintaining Quality and Protecting Users</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may transfer your Personal Data in limited situations to certain third-party vendors that assist Indeed with protecting our users and maintaining the quality of our services, products and features provided to those users.
An example would be vendors Indeed uses for fraud detection purposes.
Examples of those vendors include: SiftScience, Emailage, and PerimeterX.
Another example would be vendors Indeed uses to prevent accounts being created using account credentials that have been publicly disclosed.
An example of such a vendor is: SpyCloud.</p>
<p>– <strong>
<em>Facilitating Payments</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also share any credit, debit, or other payment card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Installing or Using an Indeed App</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to provide you with certain services and support ad attribution, limited user data may be shared with certain service providers when you install, download or use an Indeed App.
This may include your IP address or other unique identifier, and event data related to the installation of the Indeed App.</p>
<p>This may be done for a variety of purposes, including facilitating user log-in through third party accounts.
It may also assist us to understand and optimize our users’ complete customer journey by helping us: (i) understand how users arrive to the Sites.
(ii) better measure the performance of our ads.
and (iii) understand where a user has accessed the Sites through different devices.</p>
<p>When you download or install an Indeed App, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Data may be transferred to these service providers.
You also agree to Indeed’s Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy and the applicable terms of service, and are informed that you may avail of your rights at any time, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, including the right to object to the legitimate interest use of your Personal Data for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Examples of the types of technologies that may support this behavior include pixels, javascript snippets, or cookies.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Storage</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Please also be aware that we may also use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be non-negotiable.
These service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies.</p>
<strong>4.18 Transfers of Publicly Available Information</strong>
<p>When users post content on the Sites in a manner that is intended to make that content publicly available and searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties.
For example, if an Employer posts a job on the Sites, Indeed may share that Job Listing or information contained within that Job Listing with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement with such third parties.
Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.</p>
<strong>4.19 Third-Party Sites You Link to from Indeed</strong>
<p>You may also use certain third-party websites or services that you link to from the Sites.
In such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to Indeed, and is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy and terms of service.
Please see section 8 of this Privacy Policy titled Links to Third-Party Websites for more information.</p>
<strong>4.20 Transfers of Personal Data for individuals in the EU (including the European Economic Area (“EEA”)) and Switzerland</strong>
<p>Please see section 11 of this Privacy Policy for information related to this.</p>
<strong> 5.
Additional Uses and Disclosures of Non-Personal Data</strong>
<p>This policy also applies to our use of Non-Personal Data.
We may use and disclose Non-Personal Data for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
If we combine any Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, then we will only use and disclose such combined information for the purposes described in sections 4 and 9 of this Privacy Policy while it is so combined.</p>
<strong> 6.
Security</strong>
<p>Indeed seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under Indeed’s control.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
In addition, please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users, are not encrypted.
Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its security.
Please see the following page for more information. </p>
<p>Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers as detailed by Section 4.17 of this policy. </p>

</p>
<p>We do not respond to the browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) signal if enabled by the user in their web browser.
When we set or read cookies on non-affiliated sites that have integrated our job search and display features, we do so, for example, to provide a personalized job search experience to users on those sites.
We do not share any information about your use of our Sites with those third parties.
When third parties that we have integrated into the Sites (as described in the Indeed Cookie Policy) set or read their own third-party cookies, they may or may not respond to the DNT signal.</p>
