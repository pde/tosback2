<strong> 2.
Information Collected</strong>
<p>You provide different types of information in order for Indeed to provide our services, products and features to you.
Indeed associates this information with your Resume and account to create your Indeed Profile.</p>
<strong>2.1 Information You Provide to Indeed</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– From Your Account</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect data from you when you create an Indeed account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Indeed Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site.
This may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Indeed or to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you.
This information may be associated with your profile.
You may provide your specific location data when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps (as defined in the Indeed Terms of Service Introduction) to help you find more relevant Job Listings (including from the location service on your mobile device when you grant permission to an Indeed App), or when you submit a photo to Job Spotter that includes the provision of the location data of where the photo was taken.
Indeed seeks your consent at the time of such provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured. </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Through Your Activity on Indeed</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Indeed may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Site, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches on Indeed, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on the Site and each page, page views, clicks, taps, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, MAC address, IP address, the referring URL from which you accessed the Site, and any of your other behavior on the site.</p>
<p> For Employers, this may also include actions taken with regard to a Job Listing or to Job Seeker’s Resume or application, such as pausing or closing a Job Listing, opening, viewing or responding to a Resume or application, or making a decision with regard to a Resume, Application or Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Through Your Activity on Indeed Hire</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Employers may be contacted to take advantage of our Indeed Hire service, in which case you may provide Indeed with additional information about hiring needs.
This allows Indeed to determine whether or not our Hire product is suitable for an Employer’s needs.
When Job Seekers apply for a job recommended to them by Indeed Hire, Indeed facilitates certain aspects of the recruitment process including, for example, negotiations between the Job Seeker and the Employer, as applicable.
As such, we collect and process any information submitted to Indeed through this process, including but not limited to any queries a Job Seeker may have about the job or interview, information about progression through the recruitment process and information relating to salary.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When Using Automated Phone Screening</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer. Where you wish to use such a product, you will agree in advance to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When Providing Employer Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an Employer, Indeed may request that you provide certain Personal Data to Indeed in order to verify your account.
This information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.
This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>–</em>
<em>When Using Chargeable Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p> In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers and related verification information).
Please note that Indeed only has access to the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers, and does not store full card numbers or related card security codes.</p>
<strong>2.2 Information Collected When You Apply for Jobs or Access Indeed from Some Third-Party Websites</strong>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Sites</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also collect information about web sites and web pages you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome about job postings that you save, notes or applications statuses that you save or update, or data regarding how you engage with websites or other actions you take on such website, including URLs of websites you visit. We do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application form on a third-party website to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application. Indeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved job listing searches, job listing recommendations and product features. </p>
<p>When you apply for a job on certain Third-Party Websites, Indeed may also receive information about the status of your job application and the decisions taken by the Employer in disposing of your application, such as, for example, whether the application reached interview stage and whether a job offer was accepted or rejected.
This information helps Indeed further understand the effectiveness of our Site and its features.
Indeed uses this information for the purpose of improving the products and services we offer to Job Seekers and Employers and as otherwise detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Indeed provides a programmatic campaign optimizer tool which helps Employers manage, track and optimize the performance of their advertising across a multitude of job advertising sites and platforms in real-time (“Indeed IQ”).
As part of this feature, when you click on a job advertisement powered by Indeed IQ, on a Third-Party Website, and when you start and complete a job application generated by Indeed IQ on an Employer’s website or a website operated by an Employer’s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.
The information collected includes, for example, information about your device, job advertisements viewed/clicked, job applications started and completed, referring URLs and dates and times of site visits.
We use this information to help Employers manage, track and optimize the performance of job advertisements through Indeed IQ and as otherwise detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– When You Log In or Use Indeed from Some Third-Party Sites</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google.
If you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.
If you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Indeed’s Site.
Please note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.</p>
<p>By accessing Indeed through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed in the above paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access our Site in a secure manner.
You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account.
This information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of the Site.</p>
<p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account.
Facebook or Google may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.
Once you give this permission, the requested information will be shared with Indeed, which may use this information to provide Services to you, including populating your Indeed profile.
The shared information will remain associated with your Indeed profile until you modify or delete it.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>
<strong>2.3 Any Other Personal Data Indeed May Receive from Third Parties</strong>
<p>Any Personal Data that Indeed may obtain from other third-party sources, including data from sponsored advertisements that we have on third party sites, will be processed by Indeed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p>
<strong>2.4 Storage of Your Information</strong>
<p>Indeed stores your personal data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services or until you ask us to delete your personal data.
As one example, if an employer deletes a job application in their candidate dashboard on Indeed, Indeed may delete information associated with that application.
As another example, after an application has been delivered to an employer, Indeed may retain a copy of that application for a limited time and then delete the copy.
We may also be required to retain certain information in order to comply with local laws.</p>
<p>If you create an Indeed account, your information may be collected and stored in a manner that connects to your account email address.
Indeed may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code.
For example, while using a mobile device to access Indeed, Indeed may provide a Job Seeker with relevant job postings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place.
The collection of this data is solely used in accordance with the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with.
Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p>
<strong>2.5 What Personal Data is Required</strong>
<p>Indeed will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Indeed services or features to you.
Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p>
<strong>2.6 The Legal Basis on Which Indeed Collects Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>Indeed collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved.
More information is provided on this here.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Performance of a Contract</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of the Personal Data processed by Indeed is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
An example of this would be where Indeed sends a Job Seeker’s application to an Employer.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Legitimate Interest</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed or an Employer.
Such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention, or where we manage and optimize the performance of Employer job advertisements through our Indeed IQ.
A further example would be where Indeed shares your Personal Data with Indeed affiliates as detailed in section 4.13 below.
Indeed will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Compliance with a Legal Obligation</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Indeed to comply with a legal obligation.
An example of this would be where Indeed is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Consent</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Indeed relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.
Where Indeed requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
For example, your consent will be sought where you provide your location when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps to help you find more relevant Job Listings (including from the location service on your mobile device when you grant permission to an Indeed App), when you submit a photo to Job Spotter that includes the provision of the location data of where the photo was taken, or in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message such as a Job Alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy).
You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy where applicable, or by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<strong> 3.
Limitations of Use </strong>
<strong>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</strong>
<p>When a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, Job Alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again. Please also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to all Indeed products and the ability to utilize the “Log in with Indeed” feature found on certain third party sites.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement).
A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name.
When the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<strong>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Close an Employer Account</strong>
<p>Employers may close an account at any time by contacting Indeed Customer Support.
Please note that Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.
Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<strong>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</strong>
<p>If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on Indeed’s Site, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.
For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through Indeed (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer.
2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer.
and 3) Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.</p>
<strong>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Indeed Are Incorrect</strong>
<p>In the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.
Indeed has no liability for such applications.
If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.</p>
<strong>3.5 @Indeedmail Addresses</strong>
<p>When communicating through Indeed’s message relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.
You understand that you retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers’ Job Listings, but are owned by Indeed.
However, Indeed’s relay system will show the name associated with your account or job application in the “To:” or “From:” field. In addition, the above shall apply to any email addresses added to a thread when communicating via Indeed’s message relay system.
Specifically, if you choose to add additional recipients to an ongoing email thread through Indeed’s message relay system, the additional recipient(s) will also be assigned @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com addresses as well.
Please note that emails which include an email address ending in @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com will be stored on our systems.
You should not send a message to an email address ending in @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com if you do not wish for this to happen.</p>
<p>Please also note that since these message proxy and relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.</p>
<strong>3.6 Minimum Age of our Users</strong>
<p>The Site is not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
However if local laws provide for an alternative minimum age for Indeed to lawfully provide the services in the Site to you, then that shall apply as the applicable minimum age.
In all jurisdictions outside the European Union, if you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use Indeed under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian or responsible adult.</p>
<p>Indeed adopts a range of measures to try to ensure that we do not accept individuals who do not meet the minimum age and any other applicable age requirements.
If you do not satisfy these age requirements, please email privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<strong> 4.
Purposes, Uses and Disclosures of Information</strong>

<p>3) to protect our users and provide them with customer support.</p>
<p>More detail on these purposes, uses and disclosures of your information is set out below.</p>
<strong>4.1 Creating an Account, Sending You Job Alerts and Other Promotional Materials</strong>

(ii) send you Job Alerts.
(iii) send you Invitations to Apply for a job through Indeed Hire and (iv) send you information about Indeed, including promotional materials.
Indeed may use third-party partners to perform these activities on Indeed’s behalf.</p>
<p>A Job Alert is an email that you sign up for containing Job Listings in response to a search query you have run.
A company alert is one type of Job Alert which contains Job Listings and other information you have requested regarding a company.
Job Alerts may also include jobs that Indeed recommends for you, Indeed Targeted Ads, companies you may be interested in following, or other actions you may want to take on the Site.
Indeed may adjust the frequency of Job Alerts.</p>
<p>An Invitation to Apply is an email sent to you inviting you to apply for a job through Indeed Hire, Indeed’s optimized hiring and recruitment service.
Indeed may send you an Invitation to Apply based on your previous job search and application history on Indeed and depending on whether Indeed Hire is available in your location.  </p>
<p>Indeed may also share your information with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
Such advertisements will only relate to Indeed’s services, products, and features, all of which focus on helping Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates.
If you wish to opt out of receiving any marketing messages from Indeed, please see section 10.3 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<strong>4.2 Giving You Relevant Search Results and Recommended Jobs</strong>
<p>In order to optimize our services, products and features for you, Indeed may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), or application materials and answers to screener questions, to identify you and determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs or reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.
We may also use profile data to tailor your experience on the Site, to show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.
Indeed may return different results for the same search query and has full discretion with respect to the job listings it presents in response to any particular search.
In the event that you have applied to a job that is being serviced by Indeed Hire product, Indeed may invite you to apply for additional roles.</p>
<strong>4.3 Your Contact Information</strong>
<p>When you give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and other forms of Personal and Non-Personal Data, you agree that Indeed may utilize this information for the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9, to the extent applicable.
In particular, you agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), text message or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.
Should you apply to a job that is supported by our Indeed Hire product, a Hiring Specialist may use your contact information to conduct or coordinate interviews with you, and provide you with updates throughout the hiring process.</p>
<strong>4.4 Your Resume Information</strong>
<p>Your information, including Personal Data, gets placed on the Site when you upload or edit a resume, which becomes part of your Indeed Profile.
Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Data, as part of Indeed’s services.
At your direction, Indeed may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a job listing.
The extent to which your information is made available to third parties depends on the privacy settings you choose on Indeed, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When a Job Seeker creates a profile on Indeed, their resume is set to public by default, and the Job Seeker may change their resume privacy settings at any time.
This is detailed below.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Private Resumes</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Private resumes are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Public Resumes</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Public resumes may be available to anyone with access to Indeed’s resume search application and may be accessed by other Indeed users, in order to increase the visibility of that resume and help Indeed find you a job.
A public resume may also be available to anyone accessing the associated URL, and to Employers whose Company Page you are following.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.</p>
<p>If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name.
This means that third parties can view the Personal Data contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility.
If you post a public resume on Indeed, please note that although Indeed expressly prohibits the scraping of its Site any resume you post publicly is public information and the content may be copied by a third party in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>For public resumes, you also authorize Indeed to remove your name from your public resume, in certain instances. Indeed may also change the display of your resume from public to private in certain instances to maintain the quality of the resume database.</p>
<p>If you have a public resume, Indeed may use information from your resume to auto-fill all or parts of a form or application.
For example, if you use Indeed Chat, your name from your resume may appear in the messages.</p>
<p>Please note that Resume Search has not launched in all markets.
If you are located in a market where Resume Search has not yet launched, setting your resume to public may make it available to anyone who visits the associated URL.
Resumes set to public may become searchable upon the launch of Resume Search in your market.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Changing Your Resume Privacy Settings</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you place your resume on Indeed, it will be set to public by default.
You may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on Indeed.
Where you adjust your resume from public to private, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.
Additionally, Employers who have saved your resume while it was public may continue to have access to your resume even after you have adjusted it to private.</p>
<strong>4.5 Matching Job Seekers With Employers</strong>
<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, to Employers that may be interested in contacting you.
By applying to a job, answering screener questions, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, using Indeed Hire, or by replying to a message from an Employer, you agree to the disclosure of your information to that Employer.
Indeed may also provide the results of any Indeed Assessments you complete to Employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such an assessment.
Indeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your Indeed Resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes.</p>
<p>If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.</p>
<p>
<strong>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with recruiters working for or on behalf of Employers.
If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</strong>
</p>
<strong>4.6 Optimizing Job Campaigns</strong>
<p>When Job Seekers click on a job advertisement or apply for a job powered by Indeed IQ on our Site or on a Third-Party Website, including an Employer’s website or a website operated by an Employer’s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information through this feature about Job Seekers and any actions taken while on the site, as detailed in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy.
Indeed uses this information to help us understand the effectiveness of our Site and to ensure that job advertisements powered by Indeed IQ perform at the optimal level on our Site and on other Third-Party Websites, bringing Job Seekers closer to finding jobs and Employers closer to finding great candidates.</p>
<strong>4.7 Sending Messages on Indeed</strong>
<p>Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products (“Relay Service”), including, but not limited to: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, Post a Job, Indeed Chat, Indeed Onboarding, Indeed Text2Apply, Indeed Community, private calling, and other electronic communication services whether in the form of phone, text, video or audio.
By utilizing any Relay Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.
This includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.
Indeed may provide read receipts to the sender of a message through a Relay Service indicating that the recipient has viewed the message.
Indeed may also separately inform the sender and recipient of a message through a Relay Service whether the sender or recipient recently has been active on the Site.</p>
<p>We process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content, which may include Personal Data, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site Rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
Examples of such improvements would be improving the open rate of messages by optimizing their delivery, optimizing our search results, improving Job Listings, permitting applicants to manage their applications after transmitting them to Indeed, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam.
Some of this activity is performed on Indeed’s behalf by service providers, as described in the section of this Privacy Policy titled ‘Transfers of Information to Service Providers’.
As a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient.
Indeed may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event.
By using a Relay Service or otherwise providing User Content through the Site, you agree to this activity and acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of the Site and for providing the Relay Service.</p>
<strong>4.8 Sending You Text Messages About Employer Appointments</strong>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled an interview or event with you, when an Employer seeks to contact you based on your public resume, or has responded to your application via Indeed’s email relay.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through Indeed’s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
To unsubscribe at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.
Replying STOP in response to an Indeed SMS alert will unsubscribe you from all Indeed SMS alerts except those related to Text2Apply and Hiring Events.
In order to unsubscribe from those products, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those products.</p>
<strong>4.9 Facilitating telephone relay system between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>
<p>Where applicable, Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the option to avail of a telephone relay system to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications, conducting job interviews or other communication related to a Job Listing.
Such a system uses masked or proxy telephone numbers to protect users, and is only available to users who select it on the Site.
No recording of conversations or messages is performed through this relay system, although data relating to whether a call was answered and call duration may be gathered.
Such functionality is provided to Indeed by third party service providers, such as Twilio.</p>
<strong>4.10 Facilitating text messaging relay service between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>
<p>Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the ability to avail themselves of an autodialed text messaging relay service to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications and for other communications related to Job Listings.  To use this service, a Job Seeker must text an Employer’s preset keyword to a telephone number or short code that we make available on our Site or in advertising materials (such as a sign or flyer at an Employer’s place of business).  By texting the preset keyword to the telephone number or short code, you are consenting to receive text messages about the Employer’s Job Listings and as part of the application process, and acknowledge Indeed may use your personal data to submit your application to the Employer and otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
 <strong>To unsubscribe at anytime from such services, reply STOP by text message to the telephone number or short code provided or contact Indeed Customer Support.  DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS.</strong>
</p>
<strong>4.11 Preventing Fraud and Spam</strong>
<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to help diagnose problems with the Site and Indeed’s service, to prevent potentially fraudulent or illegal activities, and to protect individuals from other activities that may be detrimental to you or others.
Indeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders.
(b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Site.
or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public.
or (d) as necessary to meet national security requirements.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland, and many other regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud.
However, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur.
These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Preventing Fraud and Spam in Messages</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that Indeed determines do not adhere to Site Rules or any of the terms of this agreement.
Indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on Indeed by various means, including but not limited to investigating your functionality by setting up profiles and names that belong to Indeed.
Indeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third party if Indeed has a good faith belief that you are using the Site in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay.
This includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the Employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant Job Listing.</p>
<strong>4.12 Facilitating Payment</strong>
<p>If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information). Any credit, debit, or other payment card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.</p>
<strong>4.13 Automated Processing of Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Indeed Site and services for users, Indeed performs automated processing of Personal Data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning a user’s personal preferences or interests in terms of Indeed’s Site and services.
Where it occurs, such processing is carried out if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow Indeed to provide its services to Job Seekers and Employers, including analyzing applications and resumes on behalf of Employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user’s consent.</p>
<p>For example, in certain cases such processing allows Indeed to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and Invitations to Apply to jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users.
Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users, and you may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to contest any decision generated by said automated processing.</p>
<strong>4.14 Sharing your Information with Indeed Affiliated Entities and Websites</strong>
<p>Our core mission is to help job seekers find great jobs, and employers find great candidates, which is a mission we share with each of our affiliates.
In order to support that mission we share certain information with our affiliates.
Such information sharing is governed by this Privacy Policy.
We also developed the Privacy Center as a way of educating our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users.  We encourage you to visit the Privacy Center to learn more.</p>
<p>Information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with any Indeed affiliated entity, no matter where located, to provide you with services, to improve the Site and optimize functionality on the Site, and other purposes as described in this Policy.
In particular, such sharing strengthens Indeed’s ability to help people find jobs and employers find good candidates.
The services provided to you and the functionality of the Site could not be provided without such transfers.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy, “affiliates” means any entity that directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of or with an Indeed entity, now or in the future.
“Control” for these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct management.
And this includes Indeed affiliated entities located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Examples of our affiliates and affiliated websites include: Glassdoor, Simply Hired, Syft, Resume.com, Workopolis, Wowjobs.com, Engineerjobs.com, RescueMyResumes.com and Resumeperfector.com. </p>
<p>Such data sharing with Indeed affiliates will be performed for a number of specific reasons.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Improved Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>It provides Job Seekers with more personalized and improved content, performance, features and services on Indeed and its affiliates’ sites.
For example, Indeed and its affiliates use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), IP address, or your resume or profile information, to determine relevant search results, Job Alerts, display and moderate career insights, such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips and more.
Such sharing is also performed to facilitate improved data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement.</p>
<p>It also allows employers to have better insight into the performance of their job postings.
For example, we may share data related to user clicks on their job postings which in turn allows them to understand how their job posting may or may not be achieving their goal of attracting candidates.
By providing employers with the information they need to better utilize our platform, they can provide stronger job postings.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– More Employers, More Job Listings and More Job Seekers</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Job Seekers to access an even broader database of Job Listings and Employers, and for Employers to access more Job Seekers.
For example, this allows Indeed to recommend jobs or employers on Indeed or on websites of Indeed affiliates.
It also facilitates applications and the display of job listings from the Indeed Site to Indeed affiliates’ websites and vice versa.</p>
<p>Indeed or an Indeed affiliate is able to recommend an Indeed Job Seeker (and that Job Seeker’s resume or resume extract) to an Employer hosted by Indeed or to an Employer hosted by an Indeed affiliate.
Equally, an Indeed affiliate is able to recommend a job listing hosted by an Indeed Employer to a job seeker hosted by an Indeed affiliate.
Indeed and its affiliates can also share Employer data (such as account information and behavioral data) to provide a better experience to those Employers.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Better Security for Users</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Such data sharing allows Indeed and Indeed affiliates to process your Personal Data for the purpose of improving user security and internal operations, troubleshooting, and detecting and preventing fraud and spam.</p>
<strong>4.15 Transfers of Information to Employers </strong>
<p>Indeed sends Job Seeker Personal Data to Employers on the instruction of Job Seekers.
Such transfers are performed in the course of the job search, application and interview process.
This is further described in sections 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy.
Such Personal Data will be processed in accordance with these terms and those of the relevant Employer.
Job Seekers that apply to jobs through Indeed that are outside their own country may involve sending their Personal Data to countries with lower levels of data protection.</p>
<p>Employer account holders agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules.</p>
<strong>4.16 Transfers of Information to Job Seekers</strong>
<p>Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers.
This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on our Site and publishing job advertisements on Third-Party Websites through Indeed IQ when you have selected this feature.
Indeed may also provide information to Job Seekers about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on Indeed in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities.
This may include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken an action with regard to the Job Seeker’s Resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it.
As an Employer, when you use Indeed (for example by posting a Job Ad or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.</p>
<strong>4.17 Transfers of Information to Service Providers </strong>
<p>We may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Site and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize the services and the users’ experiences.
These service providers may have access to Personal Data in the course of providing these services, which may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries.
Such transfers are only made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable and necessary.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>– Installing or Using an Indeed App</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to provide you with certain services and support ad attribution, limited user data may be shared with certain service providers when you install, download or use an Indeed App.
This may include your IP address or other unique identifier, and event data related to the installation of the Indeed App.</p>
<p>This may be done for a variety of purposes, including facilitating user log-in through third party accounts.
It may also assist Indeed to understand and optimize our users’ complete customer journey by helping us: (i) understand how users arrive to Indeed.
(ii) better measure the performance of our ads.
and (iii) understand where a user has accessed Indeed through different devices.</p>
<p>When you download or install an Indeed App, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Data may be transferred to these service providers.
You also agree to Indeed’s Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and are informed that you may avail of your rights at any time, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, including the right to object to the legitimate interest use of your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Examples of the types of technologies that may support this behavior include pixels, javascript snippets, or cookies.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Storage</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Please also be aware that we may also use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable.
these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies.</p>
<p>If you are an <em>Embox</em> user, Information provided through Indeed’s <em>Embox</em> extension for the Google Chrome web browser, such as updates made regarding candidate statuses, will not be shared with third-parties for advertising purposes.</p>
<strong>4.18 Transfers of Publicly Available Information</strong>
<p>When users post content on Indeed in a manner that is intended to make that content publicly available and searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties.
For example, if an Employer posts a job on Indeed, Indeed may share that job posting or information contained within that job posting with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement between Indeed and any such third parties.
Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.</p>
<strong>4.19 Third-Party Sites You Link to from Indeed</strong>
<p>You may also use certain third-party sites or services that you link to from Indeed’s Site.
In such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to Indeed, and is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy and terms of service.

<p>In addition to the other uses and disclosures of information set forth in this Privacy Policy, and notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may use and disclose, for any purpose, any Non-Personal Data, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
If we combine any Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, then we will only use and disclose such combined information for the purposes described in sections 4 and 9 of this Privacy Policy while it is so combined.</p>
<strong> 6.

<p>Indeed seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under Indeed’s control.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
<p>By availing yourself of the rights afforded in this section of our Privacy Policy, you are declaring that you are a California resident.</p>
<p>All users may make a verified request to Indeed regarding their Personal Data.
While Indeed does not sell your Personal Data, you can nonetheless make a formal request to delete your Personal Data held by Indeed.
This process is detailed in Section 10 of our Privacy Policy, which also describes the designated address information for making requests to Indeed regarding your Personal Data.</p>
<strong>13.1 The Right to Know Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose the Personal Data we collect, use, disclose and “sell” (<em>we explain this term further in Section 13.2, below</em>) about you.
For more information on how to exercise this right, please see Section 10 of our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The following sections of our Summary of Indeed’s Privacy Policy explain the categories of Personal Data we collected over the past twelve (12) months (section 3), why we collected this information (section 4), and the third parties with which we shared it (section 5). </p>
<p>We also cover these topics more expansively in our Full Privacy Policy: sections 2.1-2.3 explain the categories of Personal Data we collect.
sections 4, 5, and 9 explain the purposes for which we use your Personal Data.
and sections 4.15 – 4.19, 8, 9 and 11 explain our disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties.</p>

There, we explain how California has defined as “sales” under the California Consumer Protection Act (the “CCPA”) certain transfers of Personal Data between Indeed and its affiliates that are integral to the products and services we offer to our users.
We do <strong>not</strong> “sell” your Personal Data in the traditional sense.
More information on Indeed’s affiliates and our inter-affiliate transfers can be found in our Privacy Center at https://hrtechprivacy.com.</p>

If you wish to not have your personal information shared for those purposes, you may request that we delete your Personal Data by following the steps outlined in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
