<strong>Introduction: What is a cookie?</strong>
</p>
<p>This Cookie policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Site (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”).
“Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the Site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.<br>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Site.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Site to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How Indeed uses cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>Like most websites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Site for the following purposes:</p>
<strong>Analytical Purposes</strong> We use cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Site.
For example, we can use cookies to look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform.
We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Site.
<strong>Your Preferences &amp.
User Experience</strong> We use cookies to gather certain information about users, such as browser type, server, language preference, and country setting, in order to store user preferences on our Site to make your user experience more consistent and convenient.
For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Site.
In addition, we use cookies to maintain your logged in state when you visit our Site repeatedly.
We may also use your IP address to determine your geographic location in order to provide you with the most relevant search results.
<strong>Marketing</strong> We use cookies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes.
These cookies allow us to display Indeed promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.
Indeed may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
We also use cookies to facilitate the Indeed Targeted Ads Program.
In this Program, we use cookies to determine which ads users have seen, and how many times users have seen a particular ad.
<strong>Referral Tracking</strong> We use cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Site, or to associate user activity that Indeed referred to a third party website.
These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Site, or give Indeed credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites.
We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.
We also use cookies to associate user activity with the email campaign that referred the user to our Site.
<strong>Security Purposes</strong> We use cookies to limit certain types of cyber attacks.
<strong>Testing, Usability, and Performance Improvement Purposes</strong> We use cookies to ensure users receive a consistent user experience while we conduct A/B testing on certain aspects of our Site in order to improve our product offerings.
We also use cookies to improve the performance and reliability of our Site.
<strong>Fraud/Spam prevention</strong> We use cookies during fraud reviews and investigations.
Some of our cookie/device tracking happens via 3rd party vendors like SiftScience, other times we use our own indexes to identify activity related to specific cookies.
<p>
<strong>Managing cookies in your browser</strong>
</p>
<p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

You may also consult your mobile device documentation for information on how to disable cookies on your mobile device.

<p>In addition, Indeed may also provide an employer with code for a Conversion Tracker to place on its Site that pings the job seeker web beacon and tracks whenever a job seeker has applied to a job on that employer’s website.
This Conversion Tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Indeed does not have access to the cookies in the employer’s domain.
The Conversion Tracker is simply a counter that notifies Indeed that a job seeker has applied.
If a job seeker has disabled the web beacon, the Conversion Tracker will have no functionality.
If you would like to remove yourself from Indeed’s job seeker web beacon, you must click here.</p>
<p>Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers.
Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site.
This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
To provide website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs.</p>

<b>2.
Information Collected</b>
<p>You provide different types of information in order for Indeed to provide our services, products and features to you.</p>
<p>
<b>2.1 Information You Provide to Indeed</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– From Your Account</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>We collect data from you when you create an Indeed account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Indeed Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site.
This may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you, which you answer.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Through Your Activity on Indeed</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Indeed may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Site, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches on Indeed, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), your activity time on the Site and each page, page views, clicks, taps, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, MAC address, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When Using Automated Phone Screening</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.
Where you wish to use such a product, you will agree in advance to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When Providing Employer Information</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>If you are an Employer, Indeed may request that you provide certain Personal Data to Indeed in order to verify your account.
This information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.
</p>
<p>This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.
In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information).
Please note that Indeed only has access to the last four digits of Employer credit card numbers, and does not store full credit card numbers.</p>
<p>
<b>2.2 Information Collected When You Apply for Jobs or Access Indeed from Some Third-Party Websites</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Sites</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also collect information about web sites and web pages you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome, and this may include third-party sites and web pages.
We do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application form on a third-party website to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application. Indeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved job listing searches, job listing recommendations and product features. </p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– When You Log In or Use Indeed from Some Third-Party Sites</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google.
If you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.
If you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Indeed’s Site.
Please note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.
</p>
<p>By accessing Indeed through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed above in this paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access our Site in a secure manner.
You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account.
This information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of the Site.</p>
<p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account.
Facebook may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.
For those users that avail of Indeed Family specifically, Facebook may ask for permission to share your friends list, and Indeed may use some of this data to connect you with other users of Indeed Family.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>
<p>
<b>2.3 Any Other Personal Data Indeed May Receive from Third Parties</b>
</p>
<p>Any Personal Data that Indeed may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by Indeed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p>
<p>
<b>2.4 Storage of Your Information</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed shall retain users’ Personal Data to the extent such retention is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.
In particular, Indeed shall not retain Personal Data for any longer than necessary for the purposes of performing the processing outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you create an Indeed account, your information may be collected and stored in a manner that connects to your account email address.
Indeed may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.
We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code.
For example, while using a mobile device to access Indeed, Indeed may provide a Job Seeker with relevant job postings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place.
The collection of this data is solely used in accordance with the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with.
Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>2.5 What Personal Data is Required</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Indeed services or features to you.
Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p>
<p>
<b>2.6 The Legal Basis on Which Indeed Collects Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved.
More information is provided on this here.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Performance of a Contract</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Most of the Personal Data processed by Indeed is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
An example of this would be where Indeed matches Job Seekers with Employers.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Legitimate Interest</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed.
Such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention.
Indeed will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Compliance with a Legal Obligation</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Indeed comply with a legal obligation.
An example of this would be where Indeed is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Consent</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Indeed relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.
Where Indeed requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
For example, your consent will be sought where you provide your location when you use Indeed’s Job Spotter, or in certain instances where you initiate a job alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy).
</p>
<b>3.
Limitation of Use or Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
<p>
<b>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</b>
</p>
<p>When a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, job alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.
If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again. Please also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to all Indeed products and the ability to utilize the “Log in with Indeed” feature found on certain third party sites.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement).
A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name.
When the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Close an Employer Account</b>
</p>
<p>Employers may close an account at any time by contacting Indeed Customer Support.
Please note that Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.
Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p>
<p>
<b>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</b>
</p>
<p>If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on Indeed’s Site, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.
For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through Indeed (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer.
2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer.
and 3) Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.</p>
<p>
<b>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Indeed Are Incorrect</b>
</p>
<p>In the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.
Indeed has no liability for such applications.
If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.</p>
<p>
<b>3.5 @Indeedmail Addresses</b>
</p>
<p>When communicating through Indeed’s message relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.
You understand that you retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers’ Job Listings, but are owned by Indeed.
However, Indeed’s relay system will show the name associated with your account or job application in the “To:” or “From:” field.</p>
<p>Please also note that since these message proxy and relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.</p>
<p>
<b>3.6 Minimum Age of our Users</b>
</p>
<p>The Site is not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Site you agree that you must be the minimum age (described in this paragraph below) or older.</p>
<p>The minimum age for these purposes shall be 16, however if local laws require that you must be older in order for Indeed to lawfully provide the services in the Site to you then that older age shall apply as the applicable minimum age.
In all jurisdictions outside the European Union, if you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use Indeed under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian or responsible adult.
Indeed adopts a range of measures to try to ensure that we do not accept individuals who do not meet the minimum age and any other applicable age requirements. If you do not satisfy these age requirements, please email privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>
<b>4.
Purposes, Uses and Disclosures of Information</b>
<p>We may use any information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, for the purposes set forth in this sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.
Indeed uses such information to help Job Seekers find jobs and to help Employers find candidates.
In order to do this we use your Personal Data to:</p>
<p>1) provide our services, products and features to you, to help Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates.
</p>
<p>2) to measure and improve those services, products and features.
and </p>
<p>3) to protect our users and provide them with customer support.
</p>
<p>More detail on these purposes, uses and disclosures of your information is set out below.</p>
<p>
<b>4.1 Creating an Account, Sending You Job Alerts and Other Promotional Materials</b>
</p>
<p>If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Indeed may use your contact information to (i) create an account.
(ii) send you job alerts; and (iii) send you information about Indeed, including promotional materials.
Indeed may use third-party partners to perform these activities on Indeed’s behalf.</p>
<p>A job alert is defined as an email sent to you that you sign up for containing Job Listings in response to a search query you have run (“Job Alert”).
Job Alerts may also include jobs that Indeed recommends for you, Indeed Targeted Ads, companies you may be interested in following, or other actions you may want to take on the Site.</p>
<p>Indeed may also share your information with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
Such advertisements will only relate to Indeed’s services, products, and features, all of which focus on helping Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find candidates.
If you wish to opt out of receiving any marketing messages from Indeed please see section 14 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>4.2 Giving You Relevant Search Results and Recommended Jobs</b>
</p>
<p>In order to optimize our services, products and features for you, Indeed may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.
the jobs you click on), or application materials and answers to screener questions, to identify you and determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs or reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.
We may also use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on the Site, to show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Indeed may return different results for the same search query and has full discretion with respect to the job listings it presents in response to any particular search.</p>
<p>
<b>4.3 Your Contact Information</b>
</p>
<p>When you give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and other forms of Personal and Non-Personal Data, you agree that Indeed may utilize this information for the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9, to the extent applicable.
In particular, you agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.</p>
<p>
<b>4.4 Your Resume Information</b>
</p>
<p>Your information, including Personal Data, gets placed on the Site when you upload or edit a resume.
Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Data, as part of Indeed’s services.
At your direction, Indeed may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a job listing.
The extent to which your information is made available to third parties depends on the privacy settings you choose on Indeed.
When a Job Seeker creates a resume on Indeed, they are given the option to make their resume public or private.
This is detailed below.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Private Resumes</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Private resumes are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Public Resumes</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Public resumes are available to anyone with access to Indeed’s resume search application, in order to increase the visibility of that resume and help Indeed find you a job.
Where this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.
Those third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.
</p>
<p>If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name.
This means that third parties can view the Personal Data contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility.
If you post a public resume on Indeed, please note that although Indeed expressly prohibits the scraping of its Site any resume you post publicly is public information and the content may be copied by a third party in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>For public resumes, you also authorize Indeed to remove your name from your public resume, in certain instances.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Changing Your Resume Privacy Settings</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>You will be given the option to make your resume private or public when you place your resume on Indeed.
You may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on Indeed.
Where you adjust your resume from public to private, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.5 Matching Job Seekers With Employers</b>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals’ resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<p>Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, to Employers that may be interested in contacting you.
By applying to a job, answering screener questions, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or by replying to a message from an Employer, you agree to the disclosure of your information to that Employer. Indeed may also provide the results of any Indeed Assessments you complete to Employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such as assessment. Indeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your Indeed Resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes.</p>
<p>If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.</p>
<p>
<b>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with recruiters working for or on behalf of Employers.
If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>4.6 Sending Messages on Indeed</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products, including: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, and Post a Job.
By utilizing this Indeed relay function, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.
This includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.</p>
<p>We monitor, review, store and analyze such content, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
Examples of such improvements would be optimizing our search results, improving Job Listings, provide you with personally relevant product features, and preventing fraud and spam.</p>
<p>
<b>4.7 Sending You Text Messages About Employer Appointments</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled an interview or event with you or responded to your application via Indeed’s email relay.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through Indeed’s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
To unsubscribe at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.</p>
<p>
<b>4.8 Preventing Fraud and Spam</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to help diagnose problems with the Site and Indeed’s service, to prevent potentially fraudulent or illegal activities, and to protect individuals from other activities that may be detrimental to you or others.
Indeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Site; or (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public; or (d) as necessary to meet national security requirements.</p>
<p>For example, Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland, and many other regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud.
However, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur.
These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Preventing Fraud and Spam in Messages</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that Indeed determines do not adhere to Site Rules or any of the terms of this agreement.
Indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on Indeed by various means, including but not limited to investigating your functionality by setting up profiles and names that belong to Indeed.
Indeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third party if Indeed has a good faith belief that you are using the Site in violation of these terms.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay.
This includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the Employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant Job Listing.</p>
<p>
<b>4.9 Facilitating Payment</b>
</p>
<p>If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information). Any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.</p>
<p>
<b>4.10 Automated Processing of Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Indeed Site and services for users, Indeed performs automated processing of Personal Data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning a user’s personal preferences or interests in terms of Indeed’s Site and services.
Where it occurs, such processing is carried if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow Indeed to provide its services to Job Seekers and Employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user’s consent.</p>
<p>For example, this allows Indeed to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, or provide Job Seekers with Job Listings they are more likely to be interested in.
Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy and users may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to get further information about this or to contest the decision generated by said automated processing.</p>
<p>
<b>4.11 Transfer of Information to Indeed Affiliated Entities</b>
</p>
<p>Any information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with or transferred to any Indeed affiliated entity (including Indeed Hire, Inc.), no matter where located, for the purpose of providing you services and improving the Site.
This includes Indeed affiliated entities located outside the European Union (“EU”) or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Such transfers are performed in full compliance with applicable data protection rules and subject to appropriate safeguards, primarily through the use of extensive data protection agreements, in order to ensure adequate protection of users’ Personal Data.
The services provided to you and the functionality of the Site could not be provided without such a transfer.
If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site.</p>

<p>
<b>
<i>– Transfers to Service Providers and Vendors</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>We may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Site and our services, products and features, and to protect our users.
These third parties may include (but are not limited to) service providers and vendors.</p>
<p>Indeed may transfer your Personal Data in limited situations to certain third-party vendors that assist Indeed with protecting our users and maintaining the quality of our services, products and features provided to those users.
An example would be vendors Indeed uses for fraud detection purposes.
Examples of those vendors include: SiftScience and Emailage.</p>
<p>Indeed may also share any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Examples of those vendors include: CVENT.</p>
<p>In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to Personal Data, and this may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries.
Such transfers are only made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable and necessary.
Those companies are also contractually required to treat such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with all applicable laws with respect to such transfers and any processing performed by those third parties on such Personal Data.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>– Transfers to Cloud Service Providers</i>
</b>

<b>
<i>– Transfers of Publicly Available Information</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>When users post content on Indeed in a manner that is intended to make that content publicly available and searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties.

Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.</p>

<strong>) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide you an online questionnaire relating to your industry and/or your hiring or job searching needs.
Indeed may match a Job Seeker’s responses to such questionnaires to determine, on the basis of the Employer’s responses to a questionnaire about its industry and/or hiring needs, whether such Job Seeker would match the Employer’s hiring criteria as specified in the Employer’s questionnaire responses.
In the event Indeed determines that a Job Seeker matches the Employer’s hiring criteria, Indeed may connect such matching Job Seeker and Employer by sending a note informing both parties of the match, including but not limited to sending an Employer a short description of a Job Seeker taken directly from the Job Seeker’s responses to the questionnaire.

Claims of Infringement</strong>
</p>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

copyright, please contact us via our Site contact form.</p>

Indeed Resume/CV Program Terms <p>Last Updated: January 17, 2018</p>
<p>These Indeed Resume Program Terms or Indeed CV Program Terms (collectively, “IRP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Program, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Resume Program Terms.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the FAQ page for the country you are purchasing a subscription for (which may be found here for users in the United States, here for English-speaking users in Canada, here for French-speaking users in Canada, and here for users in the United Kingdom), any or all of which may be modified at any time.
You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system.
Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program.
In addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed. Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.
In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which Indeed defines as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role.
Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRP Terms, including the foregoing term.
We reserve the right to drop any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason.
<strong>The only acceptable use of the IRP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment.
No other uses of the IRP are permitted.
</strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you. Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Indeed Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same.</p>
<p>
<strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones.
You agree to call Job Seekers regarding relevant job opportunities only.
It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing systems.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>Once you have requested that Indeed contact a Resume Owner, you may not revoke such request.
Cancellation of your use of the IRP shall be in accordance with any cancellation policies listed on the Site.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current.

<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IAP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>

Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including Job Listings and screener questions) and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
Job Ads may be placed on (y) any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (“Partner”) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (“Partner Property”).
Distribution within Indeed’s Partner Properties does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations.
You shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Partner Properties.
By posting or sponsoring a Job Ad on Indeed, including but not limited to by XML feed: you agree that Indeed may and authorize Indeed to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page or in its publisher network in any way Indeed sees fit.
All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page.
In the event you provide Indeed with an End Date beyond which your Job Ad shall not run, thirty days before such End Date Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) next to the word “Sponsored” on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed.
Indeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, “Ad”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Sponsored”, “Urgent” or similar) to constitute an advertisement on Indeed.
Job Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a certain period of time.
in some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again.
However, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a certain period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility. If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program.
Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue.
Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.
Indeed may offer certain Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently on the Site (“Featured Employer”).
Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend.
The Featured Employer program may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
Indeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice.
Indeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p>

</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks.

For examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to Indeed’s Search Quality Policies.
Indeed may require certain Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, and to prevent abuse of the free to post system.
This may include limiting the number of Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time without sponsoring, in Indeed’s sole discretion.
This requirement may be made in Indeed’s sole discretion.
For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.
Additionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer’s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason.
If you are a job board, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads.
For examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the Job Board Inclusion Guidelines.
As a job board, <i>you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company.
you may not post Job Ads on the Site for your client</i>
<i>s and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account.
</i>You acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation of these guidelines on the Indeed Site may harm Indeed and its users. </i>When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called NetVerify.

<p>These Indeed Assessments Terms (“IA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Indeed Assessments in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Indeed Assessments, you agree to these Indeed Assessments Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
The term “You” refers to the Candidate or the Employer in accordance with the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of certain skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Candidates (“Responses”) through the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
Assessments</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Assessments as a Candidate you must create an Indeed Assessments account or log in using your preexisting Indeed Assessments account.
Account information you submit through the Site is subject to the Indeed Terms of Service and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.
An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and understand that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers’ selection or use of Assessments.
You agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment and are not being asked by Indeed.
<b>You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers.</b>
<b>If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must request it directly from the Employer.</b> Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</p>
<p>Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>You agree that any Assessment sent by Indeed to a Candidate is done so at your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that Candidate’s consent for Indeed to contact that Candidate for the purpose of transmitting the Assessment(s) you have selected.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Assessment to a Candidate, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Candidate will receive, access, read or respond to any Assessment, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>
<p>You agree you have made the determination to use Indeed Assessments as part of your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any Assessment or bundle of Assessments you send to a Candidate are solely being asked by you and are not being asked by Indeed.
You are solely responsible for your use of Indeed Assessments, including without limitation any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact.” <b>You further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.</b> Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</p>
<p>You agree that an Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by you.
You are the sole party to determine which Assessment to send to any Candidate.
Indeed reserves the right to change any Assessment or the questions asked within an Assessment at any time, for any or no reason, including but not limited to quality control.</p>
<p>Sending an Assessment to a Candidate does not guarantee a Response or any further communication or action by any Candidate.
You consent to your Assessment and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
Responses</strong>
</p>
<p>A Candidate may, but is not required to, provide a Response to an Assessment sent by an Employer.
After a Candidate has provided a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.
If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Candidate will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>
<p>As a Candidate, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>As a Candidate, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment.
You understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Candidates.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
</p>
<p>The Employer sending the Assessment is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified candidate.
Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
The Employer is the sole party to determine whether to give you the opportunity to retake any Assessment or update or modify your Response.</p>

</b>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
Indeed’s Role</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.
By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Candidates.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Candidates to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.
The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Candidates as applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed cannot confirm the information submitted by any Employer, Candidate, or other user, including the identity of any user.
Indeed does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of Candidates or Employers.
You are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer.
Further, for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist, Assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and do not speak to whether a Candidate is qualified for or has such a license or certification.
It is the Employer’s sole responsibility to determine what licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a Candidate has such license or certification.
Indeed also makes no statement as to whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an Employer’s sole responsibility to make such determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel to do so), in accordance with the EEOC or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p>

Indeed Prime Terms <p>Last Updated: April 6, 2018</p>
<p>These Indeed Prime Terms (“IP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Indeed Prime in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Indeed Prime, you agree to these Indeed Prime Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
The term “You” refers to the Candidate, the Employer or the Referrer, as per the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>
<b>1.
Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>Indeed Prime is an online tool that allows Indeed Prime Employers (“Employers”) to connect with Candidate Job Seekers (“Candidates”).
The term “Candidate” will refer to users of Indeed Prime who are seeking employment opportunities through Indeed Prime.
The term “Employer” will refer to a company that is interested in hiring the Candidates through the Indeed Prime online tool.</p>
<p>Users who wish to participate in Indeed Prime apply to Indeed to enter an Indeed Prime Talent List of Candidates (“List”).
Not all users who apply to Indeed Prime will be accepted into the program as a Candidate.
However, all users who apply to Indeed Prime but are not accepted into the program will remain within the Indeed Prime database.
If Indeed chooses a Candidate to participate in Indeed Prime, they are placed into the List and they will remain in the List for such a time as determined by Indeed, as per Indeed rules, as set forth below.
Employers who are using the Indeed Prime tool are shown those relevant Candidates in the List.
Employers may choose to interview Candidates from the List and conduct a hiring process with such Candidate if they wish.
There is a charge for use of this tool to the Employers, as set forth below.
There is no charge to Candidates who are chosen from the List.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Applying to Indeed Prime</b>
</p>
<p>Candidate:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as a Candidate you must create an Indeed account or login using your preexisting Indeed account, create a profile and apply.
When applying to Indeed Prime, we may require you to provide us with certain information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, skill set, salary requirements and geographic location.
At this stage, you will have the opportunity to block your profile from certain Employers.
We will use the information that you provide us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We may use a third party vendor to help us review your application.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to use Indeed Prime.
If you are accepted into Indeed Prime, we will notify you via email.
Once you have been accepted, a member of the Indeed Prime Talent Team (“Talent Consultant”) may reach out to via the email address or phone number you provided, and work with you to finalize your Candidate profile.
The Talent Consultant may continue to work with you throughout your time on Indeed Prime. If you are not accepted into Indeed Prime, you will also be notified via email and your profile will remain within the Indeed Prime database as a private, non-searchable profile (“Private Prime Profile”).
Please note that Private Prime Profiles may be sent to Employers that Indeed Prime believes may be interested in you.</p>
<p>Employer:</p>
<p>In order to use Indeed Prime as an Employer you must also apply.
Applying to be an Employer is free.
When applying we may ask you for additional information related to your company, including but not limited to, your name, email address, company URL, phone number and geographic location.
We will review the information that you provided to us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Indeed Prime.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to Indeed Prime.
If your application is accepted, you will be notified via email and allowed to use the Indeed Prime online tool so as to engage with, and reach out to Candidates that are available in the Indeed Prime List.</p>
<p>
<b>3.
Talent List</b>
</p>
<p>Candidates:</p>
<p>After a Candidate has applied and been accepted to Indeed Prime, he or she will be placed into the List to be viewed by Employers using the Indeed Prime tool.
Employers will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates in the List.
Candidates may receive emails from Employers informing them of their interest in the Candidate, and providing them details about the job solicitation.
Indeed has no input into the Employer’s selection process.
A Candidate may, but is not required to, respond to any Employer that has contacted him or her.
All requests for interviews by Employers through Indeed Prime do not guarantee a final job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary.</p>
<p>A new Candidate may be highlighted as “new” in the Talent List.
At the conclusion of a certain number of weeks Indeed may remove any candidate on the List, at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion and, in such case, the Candidate may reapply through its Talent Consultant for consideration to be reentered into the List.
The reapplication process is at Indeed’s sole discretion, and not all re-applications will be granted.</p>
<p>Employers:</p>
<p>After an Employer’s application has been accepted by Indeed Prime, the Employer will be able to utilize the Indeed Prime tool in order to browse the Candidates in the List, communicate with these Candidates, and submit interview requests to Candidates.
Once an Employer has discovered a Candidate on Indeed Prime, the Employer may make the contact with the Candidate through the Indeed Prime tool.
No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Employer through the use of Indeed Prime.
The Candidate is not obligated to accept any offer provided to a Candidate from an Employer that contacts them through Indeed Prime.
Additionally, offers or interview requests submitted by an Employer to a Candidate through Indeed Prime are not binding on the Employer.
Employer agrees that Indeed is entitled to publish the details of all non-binding offers made and the identity of those parties that have made such offers, unless the Employer has elected to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>If an Employer is on the Pay-Per-Hire pricing model, the Employer agrees not to attempt to circumvent Indeed Prime by independently attempting to make the first contact with Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Indeed Prime.
 Further, if the Employer can establish that it was in Negotiation with regards to hiring with the Candidate prior to utilizing the Prime tool, the Employer may be exempted from paying the Fee at the sole discretion of Indeed.
“Negotiation” shall mean at least one direct email sent out by both parties, Candidate and Employer, specifically to the other and not sent as part of a mass emailing, for the purpose of recruiting or hiring, within the three (3) months prior to the Employer using the Prime tool, and where no final decision to hire or reject a Candidate or to accept or reject the Employer has been made.
In the event an Employer is on the Pay-Per-Hire pricing model and circumvents the Indeed Prime process after discovering a candidate on Indeed Prime, or does not report a hire made through Indeed Prime, and thereafter hires that candidate within six (6) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the candidate on Indeed Prime, Indeed Prime shall be entitled to 25% of a Candidate’s annual or term salary (if the term of hire is for less than one year) and all costs of collection of such amount, including any legal fees.</p>
<p>Indeed’s Role:</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agent by providing the Indeed Prime product.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Candidates and Employers to connect with each other.
Candidates and Employers are solely responsible for the information provided in any resume or profile, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Prime.</p>
<p>You understand that Indeed Prime does not inquire into the backgrounds of its Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of its Candidates or Employers, and that you are responsible for (1) conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer, and (2) complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate.
If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>

Indeed Targeted Ads Terms <p>Last Updated: January 18, 2017</p>
<p>These Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (“ITA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Targeted Ads program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ITA Terms.
 These ITA Terms apply to both of Indeed’s Targeted Ads Services: 1) Indeed Targeted Ads: Brand (“ITA Brand”) and 2) Indeed Targeted Ads: Apply (“ITA Apply”).</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ITA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p>1.<b> The Program</b>
</p>
<p>Use of Indeed Targeted Ads (“ITA”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy) and those instructions provided on the Site, and, if you are using ITA, through our online forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed through ITA, (“Targeted Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
Targeted Ads may be placed on any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”).
By posting a Targeted Ad on Indeed, you authorize Indeed to reformat the Job Ad to be effectively displayed on a mobile device.
 </p>
<p>
<b>ITA Apply</b>: In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to your post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”).
The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed.
However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement.
Any removal of the tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle to Indeed to any resulting damages.
 It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place.
The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include certain application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process.
If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed to the next stage of the application process, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.
You further acknowledge that your use of these application questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool and that Indeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these application questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers’ answers to your application questions.
 </p>
<p>2.<b> Cancellation</b>
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any Targeted Ad at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
Indeed may cancel ITA or these ITA Terms at any time.
Indeed may modify ITA or these ITA Terms at any time without liability, and your use of ITA after notice that these ITA Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated ITA Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these ITA Terms.</p>
<p>3.<b> Prohibited Uses</b>
</p>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Targeted Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these ITA Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.
<b>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Targeted Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</b>
</p>
<p>4.<b> DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>
</p>
