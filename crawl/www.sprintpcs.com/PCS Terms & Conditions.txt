Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased.
Actual speeds will vary.
Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science.
There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that-along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.)—may result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service.
Services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device’s ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.
While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Roaming</strong>
<br> The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier’s network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers.
These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice.
Your ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming coverage.
We make no guaranty that roaming coverage will be available.
Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas.
Your Device will generally indicate when you’re roaming.
Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply.
Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.).

<p>
<strong>Specific Terms &amp.
Restrictions On Using Data Services</strong>
<br> In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can’t use our data Services: (1) with server devices or host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions.
(2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections.
or (3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion.
We reserve the right to limit, suspend or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks performances or hinders access to our networks.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Software License</strong>
<br> If Sprint provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Sprint or by a third party), then Sprint grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services for your own individual use.
You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software.
Sprint may revoke this license at any time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Activation &amp.
Miscellaneous Charges</strong>
<br> Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program or other fees to establish or maintain Services.
Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.).
You will be provided notice of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Account &amp.
Service Charges</strong>
<br>
<strong>You are responsible for all charges associated with your account and the Services on your account, no matter who adds or uses the Services.</strong> Charges include, but are not limited to, the monthly recurring charges, usage charges, charges for additional services, taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services.
These charges are described or referred to during the sales transaction, in our marketing materials, and in confirmation materials that we may send to you.
Depending on your Services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and web access.
If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Devices, you authorize end users to access, download, and use Services.
You may have the opportunity to purchase Services on a subscription basis where we assess subscription charges that allow you access to the Services and/or provide you a certain amount of use of the Services for a defined period of time.
Depending on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods.
Subscription Services offered on a recurring basis do not end until terminated by you or us.
Subscription charges for recurring Services occur at the beginning of each bill cycle.
Information regarding your bill cycle for subscription Services will be provided when you order the Services.
For Services offered on a per-day basis, you will generally be charged for use before or at the time of use.
In certain instances, we may charge you at some point after you use the Services.
Unless otherwise disclosed, Services offered on a per-day basis end 24 hours after Service is initiated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How We Calculate Your Charges For Billing Purposes</strong>
<br>
<strong>Regular Voice Calls:</strong> We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute.
Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
You’re charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services.
You won’t be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal.
For incoming calls answered, you’re charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
If charges vary depending on the time of day that you place or receive calls (for example, Nights and Weekend plans), you’re charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Walkie-Talkie Charges:</strong> Charges for walkie-talkie calls are billed to the person who starts the call and calculated by multiplying the duration of the call by the applicable rate and number of participants.
You’re charged at least 6 seconds of airtime for each call you start.
subsequent communications in the same call are rounded up to and billed to the next second.
Time begins when you press any button to start a walkie-talkie call and ends approximately 6 seconds after completion of a communication to which no participant responds.
Subsequent walkie-talkie communications are considered new calls.
Depending on your plan, nationwide, international or group walkie-talkie calls may use the local walkie-talkie minutes in your plan and result in additional charges.
Responses to call alert transmissions are treated as new walkie-talkie transmissions even when responding within 6 seconds of receiving the alert.
Walkie-talkie billing methods are subject to change as we introduce new walkie-talkie Services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Usage:</strong> Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes-not in minutes/time.
1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte.
Bytes are rounded up to kilobytes, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session").
Rounding occurs at the end of each data session, and sometimes during a data session.
Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage.
If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent.
You are charged for all data directed to your Device’s internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers.
As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges.
Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.).
web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.).
additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network.
data from partial or interrupted downloads.
re-sent data.
and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications.
These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.).
Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions.
Estimates of data usage-for example, the size of downloadable files-are not reliable predictors of actual usage.
Your bill won’t separately list the number of KB attributed to a specific action/data session.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Bill</strong>
<br> Your bill provides you notice of your charges.
It reflects monthly recurring charges (usually billed one bill cycle in advance), fees, taxes, Surcharges, product and equipment charges, subscription charges, and usage/transaction specific charges (usually billed in the bill cycle in which they’re incurred).
Some usage charges, such as those that depend on usage information from a third party, may be billed in subsequent bill cycles and result in higher than expected charges for that month.
Bill cycles and dates may change from time to time.
<strong>Your bill may also include other important notices (for example, changes to your Agreement, to your Service, legal notices, etc.).</strong> Your paper bill may not include itemized billing detail.
More specific billing information is available online.
Paper bills with itemized detail may be subject to an additional charge.
Unless prohibited by law, other charges (for example, data Services or taxes and surcharges) will not include itemized detail but will be listed as total charges for a category.
If you choose internet billing, you will not receive paper bills.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Payments.
Late Fees</strong>
<br> Payment is due in full as stated on your bill.
If we do not receive payment in full by the date specified on your bill, a late payment charge, which may be charged at the highest rate permissible by law, may be applied to the total unpaid balance.
We may also charge you any costs we pay to a collection agency to collect unpaid balances from you.
If we bill you for amounts on behalf of a third party, payments received are first applied to our charges.
You may be charged additional fees for certain methods of payment.
We may charge you, up to the highest amount permitted by law, for returned checks or other payments paid by you and denied for any reason by a financial institution.
Acceptance of payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us.
We may restrict your payment methods to cashier’s check, money order, or other similar secure form of payment at any time for good reason.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Taxes &amp.
Government Fees</strong>
<br> You agree to pay all federal, state and local taxes, fees and other assessments that we’re required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services we provide to you.
These charges may change from time to time without advance notice.
If you’re claiming any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid exemption certificate.
Tax exemptions generally won’t be applied retroactively.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Surcharges</strong>
<br> You agree to pay all surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: Federal Universal Service.
various regulatory charges.
Sprint administrative charges.
gross receipts charges and certain other taxes imposed upon Sprint.
or charges for the costs that we incur and pass along to you.
<strong>Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required to assess them by law.
They are charges we choose to collect from you, are part of our rates, and are kept by us in whole or in part.
The number and type of Surcharges will be provided on your invoice and may vary depending upon the location of the billing address of the Device and can change over time.
We determine the rate for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts.</strong> We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section).
However, since some Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges.
Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disputing Charges - You Must Still Pay Undisputed Charges</strong>
<br> Any dispute to a charge on your bill must be made within 60 days of the date of the bill that initially contained the charge.
Disputes can only be made by calling or writing us as directed on your invoice or elsewhere.
You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period – undisputed charges must still be paid as stated on your bill </p>
<p>
<strong>Protecting Our Network &amp.
Services</strong>
<br> We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others.
or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and Services.

This policy may change from time to time, so review it with regularity and care.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Call Monitoring: </strong> To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls between us (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Authentication and Contact: </strong> You (the accountholder) may password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN").
You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN.
You agree to protect your PIN, passwords and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure.
You further agree that Sprint may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service.
You agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or Devices to which you subscribe or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CPNI: </strong> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI").
Under federal law, you have the right and we have a duty to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us.
For some accounts with a dedicated Sprint representative, we may rely on contacting your pre-established point of contact as the standard authentication measure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Applications: </strong> If you use a third party application, the application may access, collect, use or disclose your personal information or require Sprint to disclose your information–including location information (when applicable)–to the application provider or some other third party.
If you access, use or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize Sprint to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s).
You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party’s terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information on Devices: </strong> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers).
Sprint is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or personal information.
If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device.
By submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Location-Enabled Services</strong>
<br> Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on.
By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party.
Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device’s location information and use of location-enabled services.
</p>
<p>You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Sprint or third party location-enabled applications through the Services.
You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application’s terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy.
If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located.
For additional information on location-enabled services, see our Privacy Policy at our website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>911 Or Other Emergency Calls</strong>
<br>
<strong>Public Safety Officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information.</strong> Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your phone number, your location or the location of your Device.
In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers.
Enhanced 911 service ("E911")&amp;mdashwhere enabled by local emergency authorities&amp;mdashuses GPS technology to provide location information.
Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information.
If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located.
Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911 – you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</strong>
<br> Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft.
A lost or stolen Device does not reduce or remove your Term Commitment.
You will remain liable for any monthly recurring charges associated with the Service on your Device after you notify us of the alleged loss or theft.
You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.).
We may not waive any Early Termination Fees if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>
<br> UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE).
WE DON’T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DON’T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems</strong>
<br> You agree that neither we nor our our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers or licensors are responsible for any damages resulting from: (a) anything done or not done by someone else.

</p>
<p>
<strong>You Agree Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages.</strong>
<br> TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
</p>
<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
<p>
<strong>We Each Agree To First Contact Each Other With Any Disputes</strong> We each agree to first contact each other with any Disputes (defined below) and provide a written description of the problem, relevant documents and supporting information and the proposed resolution.
We agree to contact each other as described in the "Providing Notice to Each Other Under The Agreement" section.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Instead Of Suing In Court, We Each Agree To Arbitrate Disputes</strong>
<br> We each agree to finally settle all disputes (as defined and subject to any specific exceptions below) only by arbitration.
In arbitration, there’s no judge or jury and review is limited.
However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the Agreement and can award the same damages and relief, including any attorney’s fees authorized by law.
The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We each also agree as follows:</strong>
</p>
<p>(1) <strong>"Disputes" are any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement, including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if it arises after Services have terminated.
Disputes include claims that you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives or that we bring against you.
It also includes but is not limited to claims related in any way to or arising out of in any way any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.
</strong>
</p>
<p>(2) If either of us wants to initiate a claim to arbitrate a Dispute, we each agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the dispute, a description of previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all relevant documents and supporting information, and the proposed resolution.
Notice to you will be sent as described in the "Providing Notice to Each Other Under The Agreement" section and notice to us will be sent to: General Counsel.
Arbitration Office.
12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682.
Reston, Virginia 20191.
We each agree to make attempts to resolve the dispute prior to filing a claim for arbitration.
If we cannot resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then we each may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.
</p>
<p>(3) The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision.
We each agree that the FAA’s provisions--not state law-govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
</p>
<p>(4) Unless we each agree otherwise, the Arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service.
</p>
<p>(5) The arbitration will be governed and conducted by (a) a neutral third party arbitrator selected by each of us and based upon rules mutually agreed to by each of us or (b) JAMS.
The JAMS rules, including rules about the selection of an arbitrator, filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees, will be conducted under JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures.
The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com.
To the extent that this "Dispute Resolution" section conflicts with JAMS’s minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS’s rules or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard will apply.
However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow us or you to arbitrate on a class-wide or consolidated basis.
</p>
<p>(6) <strong>WE EACH AGREE THAT WE WILL ONLY PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND WILL NOT PURSUE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS.
We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Sprint (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual’s claim).
If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn’t apply and the dispute must be brought in court.</strong>
</p>
<p>(7) We each are responsible for our respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to arbitration.
However, we will pay for the arbitration administrative or filing fees, including the arbitrator fees.
Otherwise the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures and the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses, Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness regarding costs and payment apply.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exceptions To Our Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes</strong> Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
In addition, this arbitration provision does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency that can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No Class Actions</strong>
<br> TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS.
THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No Trial By Jury</strong>
<br> TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Indemnification</strong>
<br> You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Sprint and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service.

<br> Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must provide us notice by calling or writing us as instructed on your invoice.
We will provide you notice through one or more of the following: in your bill, correspondence to your last known billing address, to any fax number or e-mail address you’ve provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you’ve provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you’ve provided us, or by text message on your Device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Important Terms</strong>
<br> Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state encompassing the billing address of the Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state.
If either of us waives or doesn’t enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don’t waive our right to later enforce that requirement.
