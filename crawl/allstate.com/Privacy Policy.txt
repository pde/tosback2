We value you, respect your privacy and work hard to protect your personal information.
<br>
<br>
This statement is provided on behalf of Allstate Insurance Company and the affiliates ("Allstate") listed at the end of this notice.
We would like to explain how we collect, use and share the information we obtain about you in the course of doing business.
It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Assurance</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We do <strong>not </strong>sell your personal or medical information to anyone.</li>
<li>We do <strong>not</strong> share your information with non-affiliate companies that would use it to contact you about their own products and services, unless permitted pursuant to a joint marketing agreement.</li>
<li>We <strong>require</strong> persons or organizations that represent or assist us in servicing your policy and claims to keep your information confidential.</li>
<li>We <strong>require</strong> our employees to protect your personal information and keep it
confidential.</li>
</ul>
<br>
As you can see, protecting your personal information is important to us.
In addition to the practices described above, we use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures that help to safeguard your information.
For Social Security Numbers (SSN), Date of Birth (DOB), payment information, and other sensitive personal information, this includes restricting access to our employees, agents and others who use such information only as permitted by law, such as to comply with the law, to provide you with products and services or to handle your claims.
Our privacy practices continue to apply to your information even if you cease to be an Allstate customer.<p>
</p> What Personal Information Do We Have and Where Do We Get It? <p>We gather personal information from you and from outside sources for business purposes, including carrying out the requested product or services, responding to customer service requests, administering your account, and sending you newsletters and other service related correspondence.
Some examples of the information we collect from you may include your name, phone number, home and e-mail addresses, driver's license number, date of birth, social security number, marital status, family member information, payment information, and healthcare information.
Also, we maintain records that include, but are not limited to, policy coverages, premiums, and payment history.
We also collect information from outside sources that may include, but is not limited to, your driving record, claims history, medical information and credit information.
<br>
<br> We may also collect third-party information from you to carry out the necessary services and/or requests, including adding another driver to your existing policy.
If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us <br>
