<strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>PJ MEDIA is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users.
Our readers’ privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us, our Contributors and our advertisers.
Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve you, our readers, and protect your privacy.
At the end of this policy we have provided contact information, should you have any additional questions.</p>
<p>PJ MEDIA collects two basic types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Personally Identifiable Information is information that would allow you to be identified and might include: name, address, telephone number, fax number, or credit card information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include: the IP address of the server your computer is logged into, your browser type, your screen resolution setting, the Web pages you visited, which ads have been displayed and whether you responded to any ads delivered by PJM.
Email addresses may or may not include PII.
For example you might have your first and last name, or even your first and last name and city in your email address, or you might have an email address that is associated with a URL and website that contains PII.
In those cases your email address would include PII.
However, not all email addresses contain, or can be linked to PII.</p>
