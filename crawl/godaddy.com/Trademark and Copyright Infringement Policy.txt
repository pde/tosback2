<p>Respecting Intellectual Property</p>
<p>GoDaddy.com, LLC ("GoDaddy") supports the protection of intellectual property.
Whether you are the holder of a trademark, service mark, or copyright, GoDaddy is committed to helping you protect your legal rights.
Therefore, we have established the following policies for considering trademark and/or copyright infringement claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Domain Name Dispute Claims </strong>
</p>
<p>Please refer to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "UDRP") if you have a concern or dispute about a registered domain name.
Any dispute regarding the registration of domain names will need to be sent either to the registrant, to an ICANN-approved arbitration provider, or the court system.  Please review our Attorney Tips for more information about submitting copies of court and legal documents to Go Daddy.</p>
<p>This Trademark/Copyright Infringement policy specifically excludes domain name disputes and has been established to allow reporting of possible violations involving other GoDaddy products and services.</p>
