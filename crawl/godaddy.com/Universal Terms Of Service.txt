Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.</p>
<p>If we determine the account, products, or services in question are being used in association with spam, we may re-direct, suspend, or cancel any account, web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes, or other applicable products or services.
In such event, at our election, we may require you to respond by email to us stating that you will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on your behalf and to require a non-refundable reactivation fee to be paid before the site, email boxes, and/or services are reactivated. </p>
<p>We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam.
Suspected abuse can be reported by email or through our Spam Abuse Complaint Center on the Web.  Web: report abuse.   </p>

DISCONTINUED SERVICES.
END OF LIFE POLICY</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>GoDaddy reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice.
Although GoDaddy makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its Services, there are times when a Service we offer will be discontinued or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL").
If that is the case, that product or service will no longer be supported by GoDaddy, in any way, effective on the EOL date.</p>
<p>
<em>Notice and Migration.
</em>In the event that any Service we offer has reached or will reach EOL, we will attempt to notify you thirty or more days in advance of the EOL date.
It is your responsibility to take all necessary steps to replace the Service by migrating to a new Service before the EOL date, or by entirely ceasing reliance on said Service before the EOL date.
In either case, GoDaddy will either offer a comparable Service for you to migrate to for the remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store credit, or a prorated refund, to be determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion.
GoDaddy may, with or without notice to you, migrate you to the most up-to-date version of the Service, if available.
You agree to take full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such migration.</p>
<p>
<em>No Liability.
</em>GoDaddy will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services we may offer or facilitate access to.</p>

<strong>
<em>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.  All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted in the Refund Policy section below, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.  GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. </p>
<p>Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by utilizing any of the following “Payment Methods”: (i) by providing a valid credit card, (ii) by using GoDaddy’s “Good As Gold Prepaid Services” (defined below).
(iii) via an electronic check from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate (and as defined below).
(iv) by using PayPal (as defined below), (v) by using an International Payment Option (as defined below) or (vi) via in-store credit balances, if applicable (and as defined below), each a “Payment Method”.  For Services that offer “Express Checkout”, clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Account.  Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account.  Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, GoDaddy's issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that GoDaddy has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale, and that GoDaddy has absolutely no control over when the refund will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance.  You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. </p>
<p>In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then GoDaddy, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit.
or (ii) via issuance of a GoDaddy check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file for your Account.  GoDaddy also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method.  For the avoidance of doubt, any and all refunds processed via the issuance of either in-store credits or a GoDaddy check are solely within GoDaddy’s discretion and are not available at customer request.</p>
<p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month. </p>
<p>In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, all Services are offered on automatic renewal.  Except for reasons described below in this section, automatic renewal automatically renews the applicable Service upon expiration of the then curent term for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period (except for domain names which may renew for the original service period).  For example, if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will typically be for one year.  However, in the event renewal with the Payment Method on file fails, GoDaddy may attempt to renew the applicable service for a period less than the original subscription period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed. </p>
<p>Unless you disable the automatic renewal option, GoDaddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy at GoDaddy’s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.  In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager from this Site and follow the steps found here.  If you do not wish for any Service to automatically renew, you may elect to cancel renewal, in which case, your Services will terminate upon expiration of the then current term, unless you manually renew your Services prior to that date (in which case the Services will again be set to automatic renewal).  In other words, should you elect to cancel your product and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</p>
<p>In addition, GoDaddy may participate in “recurring billing programs” or “account updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation).  If we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.  In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, GoDaddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf.
GoDaddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information.
You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) cancelling products and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.  Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. </p>
<p>If for any reason GoDaddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if GoDaddy receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf.
 GoDaddy also reserves the right to charge you reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks GoDaddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs GoDaddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion).
 Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention.
(ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by GoDaddy staff or by outside firms retained by GoDaddy.
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by GoDaddy as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy.</p>
<p>GoDaddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies.
however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S.
dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("Supported Currency" or “Supported Currencies”).
If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment.
If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S.
dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase.
In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank.  In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and GoDaddy makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing).
In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>
</strong>
</em>Products and Services available for refunds are described here (“Refund Policy”).  </p>
<p>In the event you purchase a product that includes a free domain name, if you cancel the product, the list price for the domain name will be deducted from the refund amount.

All payments must be for the full amount required at purchase.    </p>
<p>You acknowledge that funds transferred to your Good As Gold Account will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your benefit.
To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that GoDaddy shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with Good As Gold Prepaid Services.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that all transactions using Good As Gold Prepaid Services will be conducted in U.S.

<p>Your Good As Gold Account must be funded on an initial basis with no less than funds equivalent to $100.00 U.S.

Dollars.  Foreign currency wires will be automatically converted and deposited in U.S.
Dollars.  Please note that exchange rate fees may apply.  You agree that you will be responsible for all wire transfer fees, both incoming and outgoing, associated with your Good As Gold Account.
Any non-U.S.
wire transfers may be subject to fees by your bank, intermediary banks, or GoDaddy’s bank, which may reduce the amount of the money received by GoDaddy’s bank and subsequently funded into your Good As Gold Account.
You hereby expressly authorize GoDaddy (i) to reduce your Good As Gold Account by the amount of wire transfer fees GoDaddy incurs in order to receive your funds.
and/or (ii) to charge a twenty-dollar ($20.00) service fee (“Service Fee”) in connection with the termination of your Good As Gold Account.  All fees are subject to change at any time, and such changes shall be posted online and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.</p>
<p>You can verify the remaining funds in your Good As Gold Account at any time by logging into “Manage Your Account” or through the shopping cart on the GoDaddy website.
Should you decide to terminate your Good As Gold Account (or should GoDaddy opt to terminate your Good As Gold Account because you have breached an obligation under the Good As Gold Service Agreement), then the balance in your Good As Gold Account will be refunded, net the Service Fee.</p>
<p>Additional funds may be added to your Good As Gold Account at any time.
The preferred minimum increment for funds transfers is $100.00.</p>
<p>

Your Good As Gold Account will show purchases and the amount of funds remaining in your Good As Gold Account.
GoDaddy reserves the right at all times to disclose any information about your Good As Gold Account as GoDaddy deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part from your Good As Gold Account, in the sole and absolute discretion of GoDaddy.</p>

 You acknowledge and agree that (i) PayPal reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither PayPal nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.  If for any reason PayPal is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for your purchase, you agree that PayPal and GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.
You agree that if the transaction is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge of $25.00 or the maximum amount allowed by law, which may be debited from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.</p>
<p>By clicking the box labeled “I agree” to the terms of the PayPal payment option, you authorize a debit of the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>(F)  INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>GoDaddy offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (“IPP”).  In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at GoDaddy.  You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected bank account, e-wallet account (including credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your e-wallet account) or any other type of account associated with the selected IPP (including but not limited to, prepaid cards and mobile payments), collectively “Funding Sources”.
In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources.
You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by GoDaddy.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded.
You acknowledge and agree that (i) the IPP reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Funding Sources no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither the IPP nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.
You acknowledge that GoDaddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor.
You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor.
If GoDaddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again.
In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your GoDaddy account.
Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.</p>
<p>If, at the time GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase.
or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems.
or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, GoDaddy may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source.
If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, GoDaddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance.
 If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. You acknowledge and agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by GoDaddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(G) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account.  In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you hereby authorize GoDaddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks or other fees related to your Account.  In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in connection with the processing of any Service renewals, GoDaddy may utilize any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction.
Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, GoDaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your default Payment Methods or the in-store credit.  In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal).
If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first.
If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using GoDaddy’s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account.
You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, GoDaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee to compensate for the risks and costs associated with providing currency conversion services.</p>
<p>You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time by logging into “Manage Your Account” or through the shopping cart on the GoDaddy website.
You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire.
Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance.  In the event that GoDaddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited. </p>
<p>You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf.
To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that GoDaddy shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.</p>

DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>(A) <em>Disputes.</em> The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and GoDaddy, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available here.  For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and GoDaddy arising under or relating to any GoDaddy Services or Products, GoDaddy’s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and GoDaddy, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.
YOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR GoDaddy FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.
Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Binding Arbitration.</em> You and GoDaddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.
(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.
(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.
The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>
<p>(D) <em>Dispute Notice.</em> In the event of a Dispute, you or GoDaddy must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”).
The Dispute Notice to GoDaddy must be addressed to: GoDaddy , 14455 N.
Hayden Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85260, Attn.: Legal Department (the “GoDaddy Notice Address”).
The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.  If GoDaddy and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or GoDaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.
Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>
<p>(E) <em>WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.
</em>YOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.  NEITHER YOU NOR GoDaddy WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.  NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<p>(F) <em>Arbitration Procedure.</em> If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (“AAA Rules”) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.  The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement.
All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.  The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.  Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.
Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.</p>
<p>(G) <em>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.</em> If either you or GoDaddy decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>
<p>i.   Write a Demand for Arbitration.
The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.
You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org (“Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules”).</p>
<p>ii.
 Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043. </p>
<p>iii.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>(H) <em>Hearing Format.
</em>In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GoDaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or GoDaddy is entitled.
The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</p>
<p>(I) <em>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</em>
</p>
<p>i.
Disputes involving $75,000 or less.
GoDaddy will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
If you reject GoDaddy’s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (“GoDaddy’s last written offer”), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than GoDaddy’s last written offer, GoDaddy will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.
(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and GoDaddy agree on them.</p>
<p>ii.
Disputes involving more than $75,000.
The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</p>
<p>iii.
Disputes involving any amount.
In any arbitration you commence, GoDaddy will seek its AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
In any arbitration GoDaddy commences, GoDaddy will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  GoDaddy will not seek its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.  Fees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</p>
<p>(J) <em>Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year.</em>  To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration.
The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.  If not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.</p>
<p>(K) <em>30-Day Opt-out Period.</em> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY GoDaddy BY E-MAILING LEGALOPTOUT@GODADDY.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW).
In the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: “I wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in GoDaddy’s Universal Terms of Service Agreement.” By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in GoDaddy’s Universal Terms of Service. Your opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of Service.
In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.</p>
<p>(L) <em>Amendments to this Section.</em> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and GoDaddy agree that if GoDaddy makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to GoDaddy’s address) in these Terms, GoDaddy will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.  If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing.  If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.</p>
<p>(M) <em>Severability</em>.
If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect.
The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions.
if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void.
The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>(N) <em>Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.</em> GoDaddy and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.  You also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.</p>
