<em>No Spam.</em>  We do not tolerate the transmission of spam.
We monitor all traffic to and from our web servers for indications of spamming and maintain a spam abuse complaint center to register allegations of spam abuse.
Customers suspected to be using our products and services for the purpose of sending spam are fully investigated.
If we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.
Our spam abuse complaint center can be reached by email at abuse@godaddy.com.</p>
<p>We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications from the sender.
This can include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

<p>       ii.      Newsgroup postings</p>

<p>      vi.      Online chat room advertisements</p>
<p>     vii.      Guestbook or Website Forum postings</p>
<p>    viii.      Facsimile Solicitations</p>

<p>We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes described above.
In order to use our products and services, you must not only abide by all applicable laws and regulations, which include the Can-Spam Act of 2003 and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, but you must also abide by this no spam policy.
Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have "opted-in" to receive messages from the sender specifically.
They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax.
Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.</p>
<p>If we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services for a period of no less than two (2) days.
The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf.
We will require a non-refundable reactivation fee to be paid before the site, email boxes and/or services are reactivated.
In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the domain name in question.</p>
<p>We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam.
Suspected abuse can be reported by email or through our Spam Abuse Complaint Center on the Web.</p>

<strong>
<em>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.  All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted in the Refund Policy section below, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.  Go Daddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. </p>
<p>Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by utilizing any of the following “Payment Methods”: (i) by providing a valid credit card, (ii) by using Go Daddy’s “Good As Gold Prepaid Services” (defined below).
(iii) via an electronic check from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate (and as defined below).
(iv) by using PayPal (as defined below), (v) by using an International Payment Option (as defined below) or (vi) via in-store credit balances, if applicable (and as defined below), each a “Payment Method”.  For Services that offer “Express Checkout”, clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Account.  Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account.  Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, Go Daddy's issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that Go Daddy has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale, and that Go Daddy has absolutely no control over when the refund will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance.  You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. </p>
<p>In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then Go Daddy, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit.
or (ii) via issuance of a Go Daddy check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file for your Account.  Go Daddy also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method.  For the avoidance of doubt, any and all refunds processed via the issuance of either in-store credits or a Go Daddy check are solely within Go Daddy’s discretion and are not available at customer request.</p>
<p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month. </p>
<p>In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option.  The automatic renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period, except for domain names which will renew for the original service period.  For example, for products other than domains, if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will be for one year.  While the details of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the default setting.  Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Go Daddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy at Go Daddy’s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.  In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager from this Site and follow the steps found here.  You may enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time.  However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</p>
<p>In addition, Go Daddy may participate in “recurring billing programs” or “account updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation).  If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.  In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, Go Daddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf.
Go Daddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information.
You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.  Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. </p>
<p>If for any reason Go Daddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Go Daddy receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf.
 Go Daddy also reserves the right to charge you reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks Go Daddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Go Daddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Go Daddy in its sole and absolute discretion).
 Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention.
(ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Go Daddy staff or by outside firms retained by Go Daddy.
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Go Daddy as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy.</p>
<p>Go Daddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies.
however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S.
dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("Supported Currency" or “Supported Currencies”).
If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment.
If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S.
dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase.
In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank.  In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and Go Daddy makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing).
In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Refund Policy:  Products and Services available for refunds are described here (“Refund Policy”).  For products and services eligible for a refund, you may request a full refund for annual plans within forty five (45) days of purchase and within 48 hours of purchase for monthly plans (each “Refund Period”).  For refunds requested after the Refund Period, an in-store credit will be issued for any unused time remaining on your plan.
Unused time will be calculated as the number of months remaining on the purchase term excluding the month in which the refund is requested. </p>
<p>Annual Plans:  Any product purchased for 1 year or greater will be considered an annual plan under the terms of this policy.  Within forty five (45) days, you may request a full refund of the purchase price of the product.
After forty five (45) days, you may request an in-store credit for any unused time remaining on your annual plan.
Unused time will be pro-rated based on the date of original purchase and, for renewals, the anniversary date of the original purchase date of the product (this is referred to as the Service Date).</p>
<p>Monthly Plans:  Any product purchased for less than 1 year will be considered a monthly plan under the terms of this policy.  Within forty eight (48) hours, you may request a full refund of the purchase price of the product.
After forty eight (48) hours, you may request an in-store credit for any unused time remaining on your multi-monthly plan excluding the month in which the refund is requested.  Single month plans are not eligible for refunds after forty eight (48) hours.  Unused time will be pro-rated based on the date of original purchase and, for renewals, the monthly scheduled renewal date based on the original purchase date of the product (this is referred to as the Service Date). </p>
<p>In no event will you be eligible for more than one refund of the same product. </p>

<p>You can verify the remaining funds in your Good As Gold Account at any time by logging into “Manage Your Account” or through the shopping cart on the Go Daddy website.
Should you decide to terminate your Good As Gold Account (or should Go Daddy opt to terminate your Good As Gold Account because you have breached an obligation under the Good As Gold Service Agreement), then the balance in your Good As Gold Account will be refunded, net the Service Fee.</p>

In connection therewith, you agree to allow PayPal to debit the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal account (“PayPal Account”) or from credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your PayPal Account (“PayPal Funding Source”).</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your PayPal Account and PayPal Funding Source current and funded, and your PayPal Account backed by a valid credit card.
 You acknowledge and agree that (i) PayPal reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither PayPal nor Go Daddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.  If for any reason PayPal is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for your purchase, you agree that PayPal and Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.

<p>
<em>
<strong>(E)  INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>Go Daddy offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (“IPP”).  In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at Go Daddy.  You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected bank account, e-wallet account (including credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your e-wallet account) or any other type of account associated with the selected IPP (including but not limited to, prepaid cards and mobile payments), collectively “Funding Sources”.
In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources.
You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by Go Daddy.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded.
You acknowledge and agree that (i) the IPP reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Funding Sources no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither the IPP nor Go Daddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.
You acknowledge that Go Daddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until Go Daddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor.
You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor.
If Go Daddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again.
In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your Go Daddy account.
Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.</p>
<p>If, at the time Go Daddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase.
or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems.
or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, Go Daddy may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source.
If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, Go Daddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance.
 If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. You acknowledge and agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by Go Daddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account.  In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you hereby authorize Go Daddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks or other fees related to your Account.  In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in connection with the processing of any Service renewals, Go Daddy may utilize any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction.
Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, Go Daddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your default Payment Methods or the in-store credit.  In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal).
If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first.
If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using Go Daddy’s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account.
You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, Go Daddy may also impose an additional administrative fee to compensate for the risks and costs associated with providing currency conversion services.</p>
<p>You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time by logging into “Manage Your Account” or through the shopping cart on the Go Daddy website.
You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire.
Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance.  In the event that Go Daddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited. </p>
<p>You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by Go Daddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf.
To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that Go Daddy shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.</p>
