<p>5.
communications forwarding</p>
<p>
<strong>a.
Correspondence Forwarding </strong>
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as DBP's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You agree DBP will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S.
postal mail.
You specifically acknowledge DBP will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than legal notices), "junk" mail or other unsolicited communications (whether delivered through fax, postal mail or telephone), and You further authorize DBP to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened.
You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>
<p>
<strong>b.
Email Forwarding </strong>
</p>
<p>The Whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration.
When You purchase a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that domain, "@domainsbyproxy.com".
Thereafter, when messages are sent to Your private email address, DBP handles them according to the email preference You selected for that particular domain.
You have three (3) email preferences from which to choose.
You can elect to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li>
<li>Have all of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded.
or</li>
<li>Have none of the messages forwarded.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>c.
Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond </strong>
</p>
<p>When DBP receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, DBP will post an email message to Your DBP account.
The DBP email message will identify the sender of the correspondence, the date DBP received it, and a brief description of its contents.
You will have seventy-two (72) hours to decide whether to reject the correspondence or have it forwarded via overnight courier, facsimile (or both).
You will be informed of the charge for both shipping options and the credit card You provide will be billed only after You have affirmatively selected one or both shipping options.
You must select a shipping option and the credit card transaction must be successful prior to DBP forwarding the correspondence to You.
In the event You do not respond to the DBP email message, DBP will attempt to contact You via telephone.
If You do not respond to the DBP email or voice messages and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a legal dispute or otherwise requires immediate forwarding and/or immediate disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP private registration service regarding either the domain name registration in question or with respect to all of Your private domain name registrations, depending on the circumstances.
This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number.
DBP takes this action because DBP will not become involved in any legal or other matters between You and third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>d.
Forwarding Fees </strong>
</p>
<p>In consideration for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handling and forwarding certified and traceable courier mail and certain first class correspondence, and</li>
<li>Responding to and dealing with complaining third parties, <br>
<br>You agree to pay DBP at the time such services are provided.</li>
</ol>
<p>DBP may change its forwarding fees at any time.
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are posted (and payable by You) in U.S.
Dollars.
You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with using DBP's forwarding services.
Payment shall be made by You providing a valid credit card for charge by DBP, and is non-refundable.
If for any reason DBP is unable to charge Your credit card with the full amount of the service provided, or if DBP is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card You provided, You agree DBP may, without notice to You, pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, sale of the domain name registration to a third party, and immediate cancellation of Your account and all services DBP provides to You.</p>
<p>
<strong>e.
Additional Administrative Fees </strong>
</p>
<p>DBP reserves the right to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the scope of its regular services.
These include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that cannot be handled via email and require personal service, and disputes requiring legal services.
You agree DBP will arrange for Your Registrar to bill these charges to the credit card You have on file with the Registrar.
Administrative fees, once charged, will be non-refundable.
It is Your responsibility to keep Your credit card information current and accurate, including the expiration date.
Failure to do so could result in termination of DBP's services.</p>
<p>You agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.
