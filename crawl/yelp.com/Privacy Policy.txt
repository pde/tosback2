<strong>Last Updated on September 21, 2011.</strong> To review the previous policy, please click here.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of our websites, emails, and mobile applications (<b>"Site"</b>).
The terms <b>"we"</b>, <b>"us"</b>, and <b>"Yelp"</b> refer to Yelp Inc., a Delaware corporation.
When you use the Site, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li> Information You Submit <p>We may store the information you submit to or through the Site.
We use the information to fulfill your requests, provide Site functionality, improve Site quality, personalize your experience, display relevant advertising, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, and comply with legal obligations.
Among the information you submit to or through the Site, please note:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Account Registration:</strong> You must provide a valid email address in order to sign up for an Account on the Site.
In addition, you may provide us with your full name, gender, and birth date.
When you sign up for a Yelp account, we opt you in to receive emails from other Yelp users, business owners and Yelp by default.
You can manage your email preferences and modify some of the information associated with your account here.
Note that you cannot opt out of receiving required administrative or legal notices.
If you feel that an unauthorized account has been created depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal here.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Content:</strong> Your reviews, tips, photos, check-ins, message board posts, bookmarks, friends, lists, compliments, account profile (including your first name and last initial, but excluding your other account registration information), and other content you post to the Site are meant for public consumption.
We may display this content on the Site, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Contacts:</strong> You can invite your friends to join the Site by providing their contact information, or by allowing us to use your address book from your computer, mobile device, or other sites.
If you invite a friend to join and connect with you on the Site, we may use and store your friends' contact information long enough to process your requests.</li>
<li>
<strong>Messaging:</strong> If you exchange messages with others through the Site, we may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.
If you send information from the Site to your phone via SMS text message, we may log your phone number, phone carrier, and the date and time that the message was processed.
Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Credit Card Purchases:</strong> If you purchase business advertising, Deals, or other Yelp products or services online, we may collect and store billing and credit card information.
This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction (such as fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments).
When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information on controlling your personal data, please see Sections 4 and 5, below.</p>
</li>
<li> Information We Collect <p>In addition to the information you submit to or through the Site, we also collect and store information from and about you in the course of your use of the Site.
We use this information to analyze and track user behavior, personalize your experience, associate it with other information about you, provide the functionality and improve the quality of the Site, and may use it to display relevant advertising.
For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Location:</strong> We may collect and store information about your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.
You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Activity:</strong> We may collect and store information related to you and your use of the Site, such as your browser type, IP address, unique device identifier, the phone numbers and names of businesses that you call through the Site, requested URL, referring URL, browser language, the pages you view, and the date and time of your visit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Yelp Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), and similar technology in connection with your use of the Site (<b>"Cookies"</b>).
Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages.
Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Site, such as your browser type, search preferences, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use.
You can disable some (but not all) Cookies in your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect your ability to use the Site.

</ol>
</li>
<li> Third Parties <p>We do not rent, share, sell or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
That said, we work with third parties and they may have access to some of your information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Advertising:</strong> We allow third parties who provide advertising services to use Cookies, as defined above, in connection with your use of the Site.
As a result, they may collect and store the same type of information and use it for the same type of purposes as described for Yelp Cookies above, and they may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they may have about you.
We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use.
Nevertheless, you may be able to opt-out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative, Omniture, Aperture, and PrivacyChoice.
Please note that opting out does not prevent you from receiving advertisements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Service Providers:</strong> We outsource some of our technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing functions, and other services to third parties.
We may share information from or about you with them so that they can perform their services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aggregate Information:</strong> We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors.
For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share information from or about you with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.
If another company acquires Yelp or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Investigations:</strong> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us.
(b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site.
or (c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users affiliates, or the public.</li>
<li>

You can manage these settings here.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Controlling Your Personal Data <p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your user account if you include personal information in your Public Content.
You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Site.

You can opt-out of this feature here.</p>
<p>Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that you and the sender/recipient keep them private.
For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your personal messages publicly posts it or its contents.</p>
</li>

We may keep it as long as is permitted or required under the law.
If you terminate your account, we will remove your Public Content from the Site, but may retain your data for a period of 5 years (or longer if required by law) in our active systems in order to ensure our ability to satisfy the authorized uses under this Privacy Policy.
