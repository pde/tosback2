<b>Information we collect about you</b>
</u>
</p>
<p>
<u>In General.</u> We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name, phone number, mailing address, e-mail address and other information that does not identify you.
When you provide personal information through our website, over the phone, or by other means the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information you provide.</b> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website, provide to us by phone, furnish to our Customer Service department, or give to us in some other manner.
This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).
We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, your opinion about products and services that we offer, and other demographic information.
</li>
<li>
<b>Information from other sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other HSNi businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected.
Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.
</li>
<li>
<b>Information about others.</b> We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us.
If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, information that may interest them or messages (such as invitations) through our system, we may store your personal information and the personal information of each such recipient.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information.</u> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information collected automatically.</b> We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website.
This information may or can include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see 'Cookies' below), and the referring website address.
</li>
<li>
<b>Cookies.</b> When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience.
Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.
If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our website.
</li>
<li>
<b>Other Technologies.</b> We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our site.
We also may include web beacons and other similar technologies in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our website visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.
</li>
<li>
<b>Information collected by third parties.</b> We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, HSNi companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site.
These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties.
This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.
Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).
HSN may use one or more third-party data gathering and analysis services, which aggregate information into broad categories to help us provide our customers with better products, services, offers, and an improved website--we refer to them here as our "Data Compilers." Our Data Compilers gather this data through the use of cookies and web beacons.
Blocking cookies served from third-party domains will not block the first-party Data Compiler cookies.
Our Data Compilers are required to keep our visitors' and customers' data absolutely secure and confidential, and only to analyze the information they have access to and return it back to HSN.
They have no rights to use any personally identifiable information for any purpose, or transfer or disclose such information to anyone other than HSN.
Our Data Compiler is certified by TRUSTe, BBBOnline, and the Direct Marketing Association, and has adopted privacy guidelines endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission.
HSN relies on our Data Compiler and encourages you to learn more about our Data Compiler's Privacy Standards by clicking here.

<b>How we protect your personal information</b>
</u>
</p>
<p> We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
</p>
<p> We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
</p>
<p>
<u>
<b>User-submitted content (blogs, bulletin boards, reviews, profiles, chat rooms, etc.)</b>
</u>
</p>
<p> We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others, create a profile, and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.).
Such postings are governed by our Terms and Conditions.
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who reads your posting or what others may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.
