<p>
<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
<p>SUMMARY:<br> MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION BY CALLING CIC´S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 1- 877-297-7793.
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT CIC'S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING THE SERVICE, SERVICE WEBSITE, OR ITS CONTENT TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF CIC HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HAS WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.
ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
CIC WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS.
HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND CIC WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS' FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong>
</p>
<p>(a) CIC and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us arising out of this Agreement directly related to the Service, Service Website, or its content, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us directly relating to the provision of the Service, your use of the Service Website, or its content subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law.
However, for the avoidance of doubt, any dispute you may have with us arising out of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") relating to the information contained in your consumer disclosure or report, including but not limited to claims for alleged inaccuracies, shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate.
The agreement to arbitrate otherwise includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us arising out of the Service, Service Website, or its content, whether based in contract, tort, statute (including, without limitation, the Credit Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising).
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to "CIC," "you," and "us" shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information under this or prior Agreements between us relating to the Service, Service Website, or its content.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and CIC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice to CIC should be addressed to: General Counsel, Experian, 475 Anton Boulevard, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 ("Notice Address").
The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from CIC ("Demand").
If CIC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CIC may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by CIC or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or CIC is entitled.</p>
<p>You may obtain more information about arbitration from www.adr.org.</p>
<p>(c) After CIC receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee.
(The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.
If you are unable to pay this fee, CIC will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
If the AAA is unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties´ dispute for any reason, the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by a widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to the parties, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their consent.
If the parties cannot agree to a mutually agreeable arbitration organization, one shall be appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
In all events, the AAA Rules shall govern the parties´ dispute.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
</p>
<p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement's other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Unless CIC and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, CIC will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse CIC for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>(d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>(f) YOU AND CIC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and CIC agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
<p>(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if CIC makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your membership in any credit monitoring or other product, you may reject any such change and require CIC to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises regarding such membership product.</p>
<p>
<strong>FCRA DISCLOSURES</strong>
<br> The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge.
The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report </li>
<li>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification </li>
<li>You are a recipient of public welfare assistance </li>
<li>You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p> The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their credit report without charge.
Accurate information cannot be changed.
You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from CIC to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your Experian file or to receive a copy of your Experian consumer disclosure.
</p>
<p> The credit report you are requesting from CIC is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian information required by the FCRA or similar state laws.
Experian's National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by CIC.
This disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian by going to www.experian.com/dispute, or by calling 888-EXPERIAN.
</p>
<p> The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once every 12 months through a central source.
Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year.
Although comprehensive, the credit reports from each of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from CIC may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source.
To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228.
CIC's Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MODIFICATION OF PRODUCTS</strong>
<br> CIC may, at its discretion, modify or discontinue any of the Products or Content or a portion thereof, with or without notice.
You agree that CIC will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Products or Content.

</p>
<p>
<strong>SECURITY MEASURES AND AUTHENTICATION</strong>

For example, for certain of our online Products, when the system is unable to verify your identity, you may be routed through a manual authentication process.
After your identity has been verified, we will send a private access code via U.S.
mail to the address in your credit file, which you can use to access your report online.
This process is normally completed within 5 to 7 days.
For other products, we cannot offer a manual authentication process and will be unable to fulfill your order if you fail online authentication one or more times.

We recommend using a credit card rather than a debit card.
Where applicable, canceling too close to end of trial or renewal date may cause a processing delay and a charge to your account.

</p>
<p> Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed.
If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reporting company, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy.
Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free.
Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of the credit score monitoring product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PLUS SCORE<sup>®</sup>
</strong>
<br> Products and credit resources on the Product Websites utilize the PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>, developed by Experian, and the different risk levels presented by it, are for educational use only.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not currently sold to lenders, and is not an endorsement or guarantee of your credit worthiness as seen by lenders.
</p>
<p> Please be aware that there are many scoring models used in the marketplace.
Each scoring model may have its own set of factors and scale.
The information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by a lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> may not be identical in every respect to any other credit score produced by another company or used by your lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not a so-called FICO score, and may differ for a variety of reasons.
Your PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is calculated using your actual data from your credit file on the day that you request your report.
Keep in mind, however, that other factors, such as length of employment and annual salary, are often taken into consideration by lenders when making decisions about you.
How each lender weighs their chosen factors may vary, but the exact formula used to calculate your score is proprietary.
</p>
<p> Also note that each bureau has its own set of data, resulting in a separate PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> for each of your credit files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>

</p>
<p>
<strong>The PLUS Score</strong>
</p>
<p>There are various types of credit scores.
The PLUS Score is a credit score model developed by Experian® to help you see and understand your relative credit risk level for educational purposes.
It is not a score used by lenders or other commercial users for credit decisions.</p>
<p>PLUS Scores range from 330 to 830.
Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk.
A lower score indicates that you may be a higher credit risk (risk of default).
There are many different credit scoring models that can give you a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk for the same credit report.
Lenders or insurers use credit scores different from the PLUS Score.
For some consumers, the risk assessment of a PLUS Score could vary, sometimes substantially, from a score used by a lender.
If a score used by a lender is lower than your educational PLUS Score, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>
<p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies - the Experian® credit bureau, TransUnion®, and Equifax® -- that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.
Your PLUS Score is based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.
Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.
So your PLUS Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.
Since the information in your report can change over time, your PLUS Score may also change.</p>
<p> If these credit products are not included in your promotional credit monitoring membership, you may have the opportunity to purchase them separately.
</p>
<p>
<u>Fraud Resolution</u> (Applicable for the following products: CreditCheck® Basic).
</p>
<p> Obtaining Assistance: There are certain steps that you MUST FOLLOW in order to obtain assistance from a fraud resolution representative ("Assistance").
These steps include contacting a Customer Service Representative by calling the number listed in the My Credit Center area on this Web Site, or by calling 1-866-584-9446.
Additional information about requesting Assistance can also be found in the My Credit Center area.
</p>
