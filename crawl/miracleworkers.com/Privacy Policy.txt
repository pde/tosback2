We have updated our privacy policy to make it easier to read and understand.
Now, Users can navigate directly from the Table of Contents to any privacy topic of interest.
We also have eliminated several privacy policies that applied to specific products and have combined them into one privacy policy that applies to all products sold in the United States.
Our revised policy also covers our recently developed products, such as our Work@ or NetworkEffect social network applications, and provides updated information regarding personal protection while job searching online.
</p>
<p>
Please take a few minutes to read our updated Privacy Policy.
These changes will take effect on February 1, 2013.

CareerBuilder provides software applications (“Apps") available to the public, as well as Apps that may be purchased by companies for their employee’s internal use in talent management or as a company-specific social networking intranet.

Depending on those individuals’ privacy settings, such information can include their social network site user ID, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.</li>

</ul>
<p>We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Sites (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Sites.
We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail below.
</p>
<p>If we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.</p>
(Return to Top) INFORMATION WE SHARE
<p>When you apply for a job through the Sites or publicly post your resume to our resume database, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities.
Those employers may use your information to contact you directly.
Additionally, when you apply for a job through the Sites, the information supplied by you becomes part of the CareerBuilder database but also may become part of the employer’s database.
Similarly, if your resume is downloaded by an employer, your resume may become a part of the employer’s database.
In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company’s use of your information.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators).
“Aggregate Data" is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.
Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.
For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year’s experience that live within a certain geographic area.
All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.
</p>
<p>We also provide reports about activity on our Work@ App that may contain identifiable information about users who choose to download and use that App.
CareerBuilder’s customers that purchase the Work@ App will receive reports that contain the information collected through the Work@ App.
The reports may include the following: the number of installations and removals of the Work@ App, the number of referrals, shares and wall posts made by you, the number of views and the names and email addresses of individuals with whom you have a relationship when they request a referral or when they apply for a job.
CareerBuilder will not provide any other social network page content to its customers who purchase the Work@ App.
Similarly, we will not share any non-public social network page content with employers, potential employers or others through your use of NetworkEffect.
</p>
<p>Information and communications on company-specific CareerBuilder products, such as the intra-net social networking app WorkLife, is accessible by your employer even where sub-group membership may be limited to employees with similar interests or employment duties.
Information, communications and activities on the intra-net social networking app will also be subject to your employer’s internal policies and code of conduct in addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Other than instances where users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason.
When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.
All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others.
This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties.
</p>
<p>Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is ‘hosted’ or ‘co-branded’ by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company.
CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.
You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
</p>
<p>We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you.
These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites.
</p>
<p>In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.
</p>
(Return to Top) Resume Privacy Options
<p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day.
When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply.
When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p>
<p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet.
To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose.
Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume can be viewed by third parties.
CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Standard Posting
This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database.
If you select this option, any registered employer user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).
</li>
<li>Private Posting For Apply Online Only
This option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searchable by or viewable to employers.
The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information, and you provide your resume only to those employers you are specifically interested in.</li>
</ol>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database.
We cannot control the use of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties.
Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.</p>

<p>These companies operate under their own privacy policies and CareerBuilder encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies.
CareerBuilder does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers.
</p>

Further, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties, such as prospective employers, that have already accessed and downloaded your information or resume.</p>

<p>Our Sites may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information.
These sites may be operated by companies not owned by CareerBuilder.

<br> Protect Your Privacy and Safety <p>CareerBuilder, LLC and its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “CareerBuilder”, “We” or “Our”) has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can use CareerBuilder’s sites on your own terms and completely anonymously if you so desire.
CareerBuilder continues to strive to provide the safest possible environment for you to search for and apply to jobs.</p> CareerBuilder Precautions Overview <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting information you submit.
This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on any web site under CareerBuilder’s control (collectively, the "Sites"), and does not apply to any other information or web site.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time.
This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2010.
Each time you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.
You agree that by using the Sites you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below.</p> Personal Information <p>In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, CareerBuilder may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users.
In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Sites (e.g., jobs and resumes).
We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general.
This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user's computer browser information, and their IP address.</p>
<p>You agree that CareerBuilder may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings, services, educational or other career development opportunities), or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Sites.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.
If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.
CareerBuilder may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous information to prepare reports that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>We do not sell our users' contact information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private.
When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).</p>
<p>All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume), that information can be collected and used by others.
This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which CareerBuilder is not responsible.
Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a link from a CareerBuilder newspaper affiliate or other affiliate.
If so, please be aware that CareerBuilder may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.</p>
<p>CareerBuilder may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites.
In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of CareerBuilder.</p> Credit Card Security

Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
As a user of the Sites, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Sites, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Sites.</p> Protect Yourself Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers <ul>
<li>Never give our your social security number to a prospective employer.</li>
<li>Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort.</li>
<li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.</li>
<li>Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e.
social security number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
</ul>Other Privacy Features On the Sites <p>You never need to provide data to search for jobs.
Logging into the Sites is always an optional task for you to take, (although logging in does give you access to smarter job search tools such as my careerbuilder, Personal Search Agents and Saved Searches.) </p> Post a Resume <p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day.
When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply.
When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p> Resume Privacy Options <p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet.
To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 3 levels of privacy from which you can choose.</p>
<ol>
<li>Standard Posting <p>This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our Resume Database.</p>
</li>
<li>Anonymous Posting <p>You can also post to the public resume database without any of your contact information being displayed.
(If you use this option be sure to remove your contact information from the body of the resume.) The anonymous option also allows you to only display selected pieces of contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>Private Posting For Apply Online Only <p>This option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searched by employers.
The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information.</p>
</li>
</ol>Your General Contact Information <p>Managing your privacy is as simple as selecting which pieces of your contact information are displayed.
This is done in the section of the resume form called "Contact Information." Using option 3 above requires that you select the Apply Online Only option from the "Contact Information" section at the bottom of the edit form, as shown below.</p> Microsoft Windows Live™ ID <p>In addition to the CareerBuilder sign-in, CareerBuilder offers the ability to sign in using Microsoft Windows Live ID service, which provides authentication for online sign in.
When you sign in to this site using the Windows Live ID service you will be asked to provide your e-mail address and a password to sign you in.
This same Windows Live ID sign-in allows you to access many other participating Windows Live ID web sites.</p>

</p> How To Spot Fraud Email and Online Fraud <p>Unfortunately, email and online fraud are continuing concerns for virtually all businesses that operate on the Internet.
Please be aware that, from time to time, fraudulent emails have been circulated to CareerBuilder users that appear to be from CareerBuilder but which are, in fact, sent by imposters.
CareerBuilder is not sending these fraudulent emails.
If you receive an email or pop-up window requesting that you sign in to CareerBuilder and provide your personal information, do not respond.</p>
<p>This is an example of one such fraudulent email:</p> Help Us Monitor Fraud <p>Please be advised that CareerBuilder will never initiate a request for your personal information via email or pop-up window.
If you ever receive a request for this type of sensitive information, please do not respond and immediately contact CareerBuilder customer service at <b>(866) 438-1485</b> or report the suspected fraud using our feedback form.</p>
<p>If you think you have been a victim of fraud, immediately report the committed fraud to your local police and contact us using our feedback form so steps can be taken for your safety.
