 Adobe Privacy Policy
 
<p> </p> Last updated: May 3, 2018
 
The Adobe Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Adobe’s apps and websites.
If you are a resident of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Inc.
(Adobe U.S.) and the laws of California and the United States apply.
 
If you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (Adobe Ireland), which is the controller with regard to your personal information collected by Adobe, and the laws of Ireland apply. 
 
Please note that in order to use our apps and websites, you authorize Adobe to transfer your personal information across national borders and to other countries where Adobe and its partners operate, including the United States.

We will only transfer your personal information to these countries where permitted to do so by law and we will take steps intended to ensure that your personal information continues to receive appropriate protections.
For more information, please see the section “Does Adobe transfer my personal information across national borders?”

to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information.
and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the information for direct marketing).
These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as fraud prevention purposes).
To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below.
Additionally, many of our websites and apps allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the "my account," "my profile," or a similar feature of the app or website you are using.
Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our websites and apps by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.
If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to an EU or other data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a potential violation may have occurred.
To register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe websites, apps, products or services, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the websites, apps, products or services requested.
All other provision of your information is optional.
Providing optional information will help us offer you a better experience, such as more personalized or tailored content or offerings.
    Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing
The Adobe family of companies (see list of Adobe entities and our acquired companies) and companies we hire to help us market our websites and apps on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe. 
Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above.
In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests.

The information collected is stored on our computers for use by these business customers.
    How long does Adobe retain my information?
When you register for an Adobe ID account, we process and keep most personal information we have about you for as long as you are an active user of our products, services or apps.
When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain, such as your hashed password and your payment account data.
However, we typically retain personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you for seven years after your last interaction with us.
Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests).
We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in future.
    Will this privacy policy change?
Occasionally, we may change this privacy policy (or other documents in the Adobe Privacy Center) to allow Adobe to use or share your personal information in a different way.
If we do, the links to the policy on our websites (which are generally found in the footer of the website) will indicate that the policy has been changed.
For new users, the change will become effective upon posting.
For existing users, if the change is significant, it will become effective 30 days after posting.
We encourage you to periodically review the Adobe Privacy Center for the latest information on our privacy practices.<br>   Who can I contact with questions or concerns?
