Investors should consider the investment objectives, charges, expense, and unique risk profile of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) carefully before investing.
Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies.
These funds’ performance will likely be significantly different than their benchmark over periods of more than one day, and their performance over time may in fact trend opposite of their benchmark.
Investors should monitor these holdings, consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.
A prospectus contains this and other information about the ETF and should be obtained from the issuer.
The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.</p>
