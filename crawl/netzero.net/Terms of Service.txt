Such account and email address and the terms controlling that account and email address are governed by these Terms of Service.
Our DSL, Wireless Services and VPN services, including in some cases the billing, provisioning, installation, devices, and delivery of such services, are provided by one or more third parties and NetZero contracts with such third parties to provide such services on its behalf.
All references to NetZero in these Terms of Service including, without limitation, the indemnification provisions and limitations on liability, shall also apply to the third parties with whom NetZero contracts to provide you with NetZero Services and such third parties shall be entitled to all of NetZero's rights hereunder.

<b>Monitoring of Network Performance.
</b> NetZero and its third party service providers may measure and monitor network performance and the performance of your NetZero Services.

You hereby consent to NetZero's monitoring of your NetZero Services and network performance, and the access to and adjustment of your computer settings, as they relate to the NetZero Services, Software, or other services which NetZero may offer from time to time.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>DSL and Dial-up Service Limitations.
</b> Bandwidth is provided on a per-line basis, and the speed and bandwidth available to each computer or device connected to the network may vary depending upon the number, types and configuration of computers or devices using the NetZero Services and the type of use (e.g., streaming media or downloading larger files, etc.), network or Internet congestion, and/or the condition of your telephone line and the wiring inside your location, among other factors.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Wireless Service Limitations.
</b> Wireless Services are subject to the following limitations: <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Coverage Maps.
</b> Coverage maps provided for the Wireless Services do not guarantee coverage, but rather approximate your anticipated coverage at a particular location.
Certain parts of a residential or commercial structure, city, metropolitan area, or other geographic region may have limited or no coverage.
Various factors (e.g., terrain, foliage, weather/atmospheric conditions, building structure/materials, network traffic congestion), many of which are beyond the control of NetZero or our third party providers, may affect your actual coverage at a particular location at any given time.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Free Plan.
</b> Your right to access the free service for mobile broadband, if available in your area, terminates on the date specified when you initially signed up for this free service and may not be renewed.
If you upgrade to a pay plan with that device during that period, you may not return to the free service plan.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Availability of Service.
</b> The Wireless Services may not be available at any or all times in all areas.
Even within coverage areas, and for a variety of reasons that may be beyond NetZero's reasonable control, service availability, quality, signal strength, and network speeds may vary, be lower than advertised, or be insufficient for your desired use of the service.
You agree that NetZero is not liable for problems relating to Wireless Service availability or quality, regardless of the cause(s) of these problems.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Maintenance.
</b> To provide the best possible service to its customers, NetZero or its third party provider(s) periodically performs maintenance on its network.
In some cases, this may require NetZero to conduct either a planned or unplanned interruption of the Wireless Services.
NetZero will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance outages in a way that minimizes the impact on customers, but NetZero cannot guarantee that your Wireless Services will not be interrupted and cannot always give advance notice of such outages.
You acknowledge and agree that NetZero shall not be responsible for any losses or damages (of any kind) that may be suffered by you as a result of any service interruptions due to maintenance outages.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Network Management.
</b> NetZero reserves the right to engage in reasonable network management to protect the overall integrity of its network, including detecting malicious traffic patterns and attempting to prevent the distribution of viruses or other malicious code, and through techniques such as reducing the aggregate bandwidth available to excessive bandwidth users during periods of congestion.
While the determination of what constitutes excessive use depends on the specific state of the network at a particular location at any given time, excessive use will be determined primarily by resource consumption.
For further information, please refer to NetZero's Acceptable Use Guidelines.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Tampering with the Equipment.
</b> You must not use the Wireless Services with any equipment that has an altered electronic serial number or equipment identifier or any equipment that has undergone a factory reset, without seeking and obtaining NetZero's express advance written permission in each instance.
In addition, you may not use any serviced, altered, modified, stolen, or tampered equipment with the service, and you may not permit any other person to do so (unless specifically authorized in advance by NetZero, in writing).
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Unlimited Use Plans.</b> If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as "unlimited", you should be aware that such unlimited plans are subject to certain limitations.
With select plans and product offers, NetZero will reduce connection speeds when data usage exceeds the specific thresholds disclosed in its service offers.
You will continue to have data access but maximum speeds may be limited per your plan to 2G speeds of 56-128 Kbps for the remainder of the plan cycle after the combined 3G/4G allotment has been reached.
During this time, you may experience slower page loads, file downloads and degraded streaming media.
Connection speeds will be restored when your new monthly billing cycle begins.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>VARIATIONS OF SPEED AND SERVICE QUALITY DISCLAIMER.
THE SPEED AND BANDWIDTH AVAILABLE TO EACH COMPUTER OR DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE NETZERO NETWORK, AND HENCE THE QUALITY OF THE WIRELESS SERVICES, MAY VARY FOR MANY REASONS, WITHIN OR BEYOND NETZERO'S CONTROL, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: (i) THE NUMBER OF USERS, COMPUTERS OR DEVICES CONNECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE NETWORK, AND THE TYPES OF USAGE IN WHICH THEY ARE ENGAGED.
(ii) THE AMOUNT OF DATA BEING TRANSFERRED OVER THE NETWORK, (iii) NETWORK SIGNAL QUALITY.
(iv) PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF YOUR EQUIPMENT AND THE EQUIPMENT OF THIRD PARTIES.
(v) TERRAIN AND FOLIAGE.

</li>
<li>
<b>Additional Services.

and (c) international calls are not permitted and roaming is not available.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers.
</b> You can request us to port your number to another carrier, and NetZero Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete.
We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful.
If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the NetZero Services associated with that number.
If you port your number, you will not be refunded any prepaid amounts made for your current billing cycle.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Customer Proprietary Network Information.
</b> As we provide telecommunications products and services to you, we collect information such as the numbers you call and when you call them, as well as the particular services you use, and other information found on your bill ("<b>CPNI</b>").
Under federal law, you have the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Communication with You.
</b> You consent to the use by us or our authorized agents of predictive or autodialing equipment, email, text messaging, facsimile or other reasonable means to contact you to advise you about our Wireless Services or other matters or offers we believe may be of interest to you.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Third-Party Applications.
</b> If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require NetZero to disclose your information-including location information (when applicable)-to the application provider or some other third party.
If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications through the NetZero Services, you agree and authorize NetZero to provide information related to your use of the applicable services or the application(s).

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>911 Or Other Emergency Calls.
</b> When making 911 or other emergency calls, be prepared to provide your location information.
Enhanced 911 service ("E911")-where enabled by local emergency authorities-uses GPS technology to provide location information but may not always provide accurate location information.
Text to 911 may be available in some locations where NetZero Services are provided, and is dependent on the public safety agency's ability to receive text messaging.
NetZero recommends that you use voice communications as your primary method of contacting 911.
Standard airtime and toll rates apply.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Location.
</b> Our third party carriers may collect information about the approximate location of your device in relation to our cell towers and the Global Positioning System ("<b>GPS</b>").
They may use that information, as well as other usage and performance information also obtained from their networks and your device, to provide you with wireless voice and data services, and to maintain and improve their networks and the quality of your wireless experience.
They may also use location information to create aggregate data from which your personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured.
Such aggregate data may be used for a variety of purposes such as scientific and marketing research and services such as vehicle traffic volume monitoring.
It is your responsibility to notify users on your account that this location information from devices may be collected and used.
<br>
<br>

</ul>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Theft or Fraudulent Use of the Service.
Loss or Theft of Equipment.
</b> If your Equipment is lost or stolen, or if you become aware at any time that the Wireless Service is being fraudulently used, it is imperative that you notify NetZero immediately, so that NetZero can suspend your Wireless Service (and the ability to use any Equipment that you have purchased for use in association with that Service) in order to prevent further usage and limit your liability.
You can do this by calling NetZero's customer service department at 800-638-9376.
Once you notify NetZero, NetZero will suspend your Wireless Services (i.e., until you obtain replacement Equipment usable with the service or such fraudulent activity has ceased, as applicable) and, if you are on a continuous service plan with recurring payments, you will not be responsible for charges incurred with the lost or stolen Equipment during that period of suspension.
<br>

<br>
<br>
</li>

The taxes, fees and other charges detailed in subsections b) through e) may vary on a monthly basis unless you have a Talk/Text/Data plan for which NetZero pays applicable taxes, fees and other charges.
any variations will be reflected in your monthly charge.
<br>
<br>
For regular voice calls in the Talk/Text/Data services, we round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute.
Time starts when you press "Talk" or your device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services.
You won't be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal.
For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks.
Call time data displayed on your device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account.
Call time for a single call may be subject to a maximum duration and may be automatically terminated if the maximum duration is exceeded.
<br>
<br>
Subject to any applicable law, fees and charges for NetZero Services are non-refundable unless the pricing terms for the applicable NetZero Service expressly says otherwise.
NetZero may provide a thirty (30) day money back guarantee for its DSL Service (see your service plan description).
If your DSL plan includes a money-back guarantee, your thirty (30) day money-back guarantee begins upon the date NetZero begins billing you for the DSL service.
During this thirty (30) day period you may cancel the DSL service and receive a full refund of the monthly charge you have actually paid to NetZero as well as any activation charges paid to NetZero.
provided, however, in order to receive your refund you must return all Equipment to NetZero in good working condition within thirty (30) days of termination.
NetZero will provide you with a pre-paid mailing label and instructions for the return of your Equipment.
In the event you fail to return the Equipment within thirty (30) days, you will be unable to receive your refund.
Early termination fees will not apply to DSL service terminated within the thirty (30) day money-back guarantee period.
The thirty (30) day money-back guarantee does not apply to customers who change between monthly, annual, bundled or other DSL service pricing plans and does not apply to registrations with free introductory periods.
The money-back guarantee is limited to one per subscriber per address.
<br>
<br>
You must provide a valid method of payment (i.e.
PIN code, credit card, checking account, etc., depending on the type of NetZero Service) prior to and during any times you receive billable NetZero Services.
For continuous service plans with recurring payments, you are responsible for keeping all of your billing information, including your payment method, up to date.
You expressly authorize NetZero (or third parties acting on behalf of NetZero) to charge all NetZero subscription fees and other charges, including payment transaction fees for certain payment methods, to the payment method you have designated.
You acknowledge and agree that NetZero will not obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options.
If you have any billing-related questions or want to stop a recurring payment from being charged to your designated payment method, call our toll-free billing support number (1-800-638-9376).
Some fees that you may incur using the NetZero Services may accumulate on your NetZero account before they are charged to your designated payment method.
Set up fees, activation fees, installation fees, other non-recurring fees, and Equipment charges, if applicable, will be included in your first month's bill.
NetZero will assess a late fee of 1.5% per month (or the highest amount permissible by law, whichever is less) if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due.
You will be liable for any fees NetZero incurs in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you.
ANY BILLING PROBLEMS OR DISCREPANCIES MUST BE BROUGHT TO NETZERO'S ATTENTION BY YOU WITHIN ONE HUNDRED (100) DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ARE BILLED.
IF YOU DO NOT BRING THEM TO NETZERO'S ATTENTION WITHIN ONE HUNDRED (100) DAYS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE SUCH PROBLEMS OR DISCREPANCIES WITH NETZERO.
NetZero may suspend or terminate your use of the NetZero Services if you fail to provide a valid designated payment method upon request, or if NetZero is unable for any reason to bill charges to your designated payment method.
<br>
<br>
For monthly subscribers on continuous plans with recurring payments, your NetZero Service will typically be billed on the same day each month based on the date you register for your service, unless you are notified otherwise by NetZero.
For example, if you register for service on the 15th of the month, you will be billed on (or shortly after) the 15th each subsequent month for service.
Note that if you register on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, your billing date will be the 1st of the month.
For multi-month subscribers (i.e.
annual and semi-annual), your NetZero Service will be billed on the same day of the month at the prescribed renewal period.
Billing for your dial-up or VPN NetZero Service will automatically begin upon registration of your service.
Billing for the first month of your NetZero DSL service will be prorated based on the date provisioning of your service is complete and ready for use ("<b>Service Ready Date</b>").
Please note that the Service Ready Date is not determined by the date you install and/or initially use the DSL service, but rather the date such service is provided to your location by NetZero's service provider.
When you purchase your NetZero Wireless Services Equipment directly from NetZero, billing for the first month of your Wireless Service will be prorated based on the estimated arrival of your Wireless Services Equipment.
Please note that the first month's prorated bill is not determined by the date you install and/or initially use the Wireless Service, but rather the date Equipment is expected to arrive.
If you are an existing NetZero pay customer and you sign up for a new NetZero Service with a recurring payment, the term and fee for the first period of your new NetZero Service will be pro-rated to coincide with your current billing cycle.
<br>
<br>
If you are purchasing a VPN, dial-up or DSL Internet access service plan, at the end of any free or discounted period, if applicable, and at the end of each plan term, you will be automatically renewed into and charged for the same plan at the then current price unless you select a different plan or cancel your service.
If you are purchasing a Wireless Services continuous service plan with recurring payments, (i) access to the free service for mobile broadband, if available in your area, terminates on the date specified when you initially signed up for this free service and may not be renewed, and (ii) at the end of any discounted period, if applicable, and at the end of each plan term, you will be automatically renewed into and charged for the same plan at the then current price unless you select a different plan or cancel your service.
<br>
<br>
You are responsible for all fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes and purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account, including your children and other members of your family.
This means that, unless your account or payment method information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently by someone other than those authorized to use your account, you will be responsible for all usage and purchases under your account.
<br>
<br>
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL AMOUNTS CHARGED BY NETZERO AND BY YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR ALL CALLS YOU MAKE, INCLUDING CALLS TO NETZERO'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT LINES.
CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACCESS TELEPHONE NUMBERS YOU USE TO ACCESS THE NETZERO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE BY YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDER.
FOR DIAL-UP SERVICE, BY ACCEPTING THE ACCESS NUMBERS DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OR USING ACCESS NUMBERS YOU MAY OTHERWISE SELECT, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TELEPHONE CHARGES RELATED TO ACCESSING OUR SERVICES, AND NETZERO WILL NOT REIMBURSE YOU FOR ANY SUCH CHARGES INCLUDING LONG DISTANCE OR TOLL CHARGES.
UNLESS YOUR PLAN PROVIDES OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE CHARGED A FEE FOR CALLS TO NETZERO TECHNICAL SUPPORT.
<br>
<br>
If your NetZero Service plan is time-metered (meaning that you have a set number of hours during which you may utilize the service each month), you will be responsible for paying any per minute charges imposed by NetZero for exceeding your monthly allotment of hours.
Use of the NetZero Service for time-metered plans is measured in minutes and is rounded up to the next whole minute.
<br>
<br>
You may obtain pricing information for supplemental services or features, as well as answers to common billing questions by going to the NetZero Site.
<br>
<br>
Under your Wireless Services plan, your data usage will be deducted from your plan's available data allocation.
Unused data expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle or such other time period as specified in your plan (e.g., after thirty (30) days from date of PIN code activation).
If you are on a continuous service plan and you use your allocation of data before the end of the data expiration date, you may (i) purchase an additional data allocation through our top-up service to continue using the Wireless Services during the current billing cycle (top-up data allocations are good for thirty (30) days from date of purchase), (ii) upgrade your plan, or (iii) wait until the beginning of the next billing cycle to have access to the Wireless Service.
If you are on a PIN activated service plan and you use your allocation of data before the end of the data expiration date, you may purchase an additional data allocation with a valid credit card or with a new PIN code through our top-up service (top-up data allocations are good for thirty (30) days from date of PIN code activation).
Under the mobile broadband free service plan, if available in your area, you will be allocated a certain amount of data usage per month with your purchase of Equipment (see your plan description for more information).
Your right to access to this free service plan terminates on the date specified when you initially signed up for this free service and may not be renewed.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Events That Could Cause Termination of Your DSL Service.
</b> If you are purchasing a fixed line DSL service (i.e., non-satellite DSL service), your DSL service is tied to the broadband connection into your house or building.
As such, certain actions you take that impact your broadband connection could result in the termination of your DSL service.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, changing your telephone service provider, changing your telephone number, or ordering a service that impacts or changes your underlying broadband connection (such as ordering cable television service from a telephone company).
ANY SUCH TERMINATION WILL BE TREATED AS TERMINATION OF YOUR DSL SERVICE BY YOU AND MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE.
ADDITIONALLY, YOUR DSL SERVICE IS NOT PORTABLE.
SHOULD YOU MOVE, YOU WILL NEED TO CANCEL YOUR DSL SERVICE (WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE) AND REORDER IT.

<br>
</li>

<p>5.0 Limitation of NetZero's Liability</p> IN NO EVENT SHALL NETZERO OR ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY SECTION OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF USE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND OR LOSS OF BUSINESS GOODWILL OR OPPORTUNITY) WHETHER OR NOT NETZERO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES.
NETZERO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY AND IN NO EVENT SHALL NETZERO'S LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE DOLLAR ($1.00) OR ANY AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID IN CASH BY YOU TO NETZERO FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR THE PRIOR MONTH.

§ 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, NetZero will terminate your account if you use your account privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so.
After proper notification by the copyright holder or its agent to NetZero and later confirmation through court order or an admission by the subscriber that an account has been an instrument of unlawful infringement, NetZero will terminate your account.
NetZero may also, in its sole discretion, decide to terminate your account privileges prior to that time if it has good faith belief that infringement has occurred.

<p>8.0 Dispute Resolution </p>
This section describes what rights you and NetZero possess if you and NetZero have a dispute.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Providing Notice of a Claim.
</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You and NetZero agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us ("<b>Disputes or Claims</b>").
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to: <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Disputes or Claims related in any way to a NetZero Service, Equipment, the Rules, billing, privacy, advertising, or NetZero's communications with you.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Disputes or Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Disputes or Claims that arose before your agreement to these Terms of Services or any prior agreement.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Disputes or Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Disputes or Claims that may arise after the termination of your NetZero Service.
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("<b>Notice</b>").
Notice to NetZero must be sent to NetZero's customer service address at: NetZero Dispute Resolution, United Online Inc., PO BOX 7064, Woodland Hills, CA 91365.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The Notice must include (a) the nature and basis of your Dispute or Claim.
(b) identification or enclosure of all relevant documents and information.
and (c) a description of the specific relief that you seek from NetZero.
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Providing NetZero an Opportunity to Informally Resolve Your Dispute.</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Before you may pursue or participate in any Dispute or Claim (or raise such Dispute or Claim as a defense) in small claims court or in arbitration against NetZero, you must first send the Notice described above, and you must allow NetZero a reasonable opportunity to resolve your Dispute or Claim.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>After NetZero receives your Notice, you and NetZero agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your Dispute or Claim.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you and NetZero do not reach a resolution of your Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after NetZero receives your written Notice, you may pursue your Dispute or Claim in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in small claims court.
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration.</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If you and NetZero cannot reach an informal resolution to the Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after NetZero's receipt of your Notice, you or NetZero may commence an arbitration proceeding by sending an arbitration demand ("<b>Arbitration Demand</b>") to the following address: NetZero Dispute Resolution, United Online Inc., PO BOX 7064, Woodland Hills, CA 91365.
The parties agree to arbitrate any Dispute or Claim between the parties, except to the extent either party chooses to instead pursue the Dispute or Claim in small claims court as provided below.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, upon you or NetZero filing an Arbitration Demand, NetZero will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your Dispute or Claim exceeds $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses).
If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses) in damages, the American Arbitration Association's ("<b>AAA</b>") Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the "<b>AAA Rules</b>") will govern the payment of these fees.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The AAA Rules, as modified by these Terms of Service, will govern the arbitration.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If your Dispute or Claim is for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses), NetZero agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.
If your Dispute or Claim exceeds $10,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys' fees or other fees or expenses), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Unless NetZero and you agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in which your most recent billing address (as provided to NetZero) is located.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the wireless industry, will conduct the arbitration.
If no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of you and NetZero.
Except as allowed under applicable law and the AAA Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties.
Judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
This provision will be specifically enforceable in any court.
THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES).
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, NetZero will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or Claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
Also, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>NetZero may make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award.
If, after the arbitrator finds in your favor on the merits of the claim, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than NetZero's written offer, NetZero will: (a) pay you the greater of the amount of the award or $7,500 ("<b>Alternative Payment</b>").
and (b) pay your attorney, if you use an attorney, twice the amount of any reasonable attorneys' fees awarded by the arbitrator, and reimburse any expenses that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your arbitration claim ("<b>Attorney Fee Premium</b>").
The Attorney Fee Premium does not supplant any right you may have to reasonable attorneys' fees under applicable law.
Thus, if you would be entitled to a greater amount under applicable law, the Attorney Fee Premium does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.
You may not, however, recover duplicative attorneys' fees or costs.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If NetZero does not make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award, you and your attorney will be entitled to the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Premium, respectively, if the arbitrator decides in your favor on the merits.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>NetZero agrees that it will not seek any award of attorneys' fees, even if it is entitled to such fees.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The arbitrator may make any determinations and resolve any Dispute or Claim as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, the Alternative Payment, or the Attorney Fee Premium at any time during the proceeding and within fourteen (14) days after the arbitrator's final ruling on the merits.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>YOU AND NETZERO AGREE THAT: <br>
<br>
</b>
<ul>
<b>
<li>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
NEITHER YOU NOR NETZERO SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CLAIM.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S DISPUTES OR CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
<br>
<br>
</li>
</b>
<li>
<b>NETZERO DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION.
ACCORDINGLY, IF A COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE ABOVE PROVISIONS REGARDING CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO YOU.
WHETHER A DISPUTE OR CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND NETZERO HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
</b>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This arbitration agreement covers any Dispute or Claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and NetZero, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the Dispute or Claim arises or may arise before or after the period(s) during which you are receiving NetZero Services.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to "<b>NetZero</b>," "<b>we</b>," and "<b>us</b>" include NetZero, NetZero's Affiliates, and each such entity's respective the directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, suppliers, and assignees.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>You or NetZero must bring any Dispute or Claim arising out of or related to the Rules, or the relationship between you and NetZero, within two (2) years after the Dispute or Claim arises, or the Dispute or Claim will be permanently barred.
To the extent the law applicable under the Governing Law section below makes this limitations period unenforceable with respect to any Dispute(s) or Claim(s), then the statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern the Rules under the Governing Law section below shall apply.
