com® WikiAnswers®, or blufrTM (the "Sites"), each an Answers Corporation (together with its affiliates, "Answers," "us," "our," or "we") website.
Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at the Sites and in connection with the various services and software products we provide on or through the Sites (for example, 1-Click AnswersTM, collectively the "Services").
This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated in our Terms of Use and by using the Sites and Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.
If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of the Sites or Services.
What We Track: Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers known as the "Internet Protocol" IP address.
Like most web servers, when a visitor requests a page from the Sites, our servers automatically recognize and log his/her domain name and IP address, along with the access times, referring web sites, platform, and browser type.
The information collected is not personally identifiable (as described here) and is used only to provide statistics about usage of the Sites in the aggregate to improve the quality of the Sites and Services, to better understand how people interact with us, to deliver advertising and measure its effectiveness, to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, or to cooperate with law enforcement.
We may use third party contractors to collect and aggregate such information.
Additionally, please note that none of the Services include "spyware," meaning the Services do not run any background processes that report information about your software or hardware configuration or your web browsing or purchasing habits.
How We Track It: The Sites and Services use either cookies and/or registry settings on your computer to store user information.
A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
Additionally, some ad networks may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about usage on the Sites.
A web beacon is a transparent image, typically in GIF format that can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
You may disable cookies on your web browser, thereby also rendering some web beacons unusable.
You can use the Sites and Services even if cookies are disabled, but this may impact our ability to adapt any of the Sites or Services according to your preferences.
Personally Identifiable Information: Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, including your first and last name, a home or physical address, email address, and telephone number.
Information identifying an entity other than an individual (e.
g.
, a school or library) does not constitute personally identifiable information and is treated the same as anonymous information discussed in this privacy policy.
Although you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to use most parts of the Sites or Services, registration and full utilization of some of our Services do require that you provide certain personally identifiable information.
For example, personally identifiable information you might provide could include your contact information if you participate in a promotion or sweepstakes, your email address if you are registering for WikiAnswers.

We have put in place procedures reasonably designed to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
In accordance with the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

g.

These companies and networks may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our ad networks may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser or use a "web beacon.
" An example of such ad network is Google, Inc.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Google, click here.
For more information on the Sites' use of other third-party ad networks, please click here.
Certain third-party ad network providers may use web beacons and cookies to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, using non-personally identifiable data (such as sites visited and browser type) gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience.
This is also known as online behavioral advertising.
An example of such ad network serving advertisements on our site is AOL/Ad.

Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted.
