<p>Read the complete WebMD Privacy Policy.</p> WebMD Privacy Policy <p>WebMD understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our users.
This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of WebMD and its services.
It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information.
We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by WebMD that are intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including WebMD.com, MedicineNet.com, RxList.com, and eMedicineHealth.com and including the mobile optimized versions of these sites (we refer to these sites collectively as the “WebMD Web Sites”).
This Privacy Policy also applies to the consumer-facing version of the WebMD Health Manager Product.
However, if you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record at WebMD.com by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health plan's website remains applicable to your personal health record at WebMD.com.
If your employer or health plan account is no longer made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have access to your health information from WebMD.com, using the same username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the WebMD Web Sites also apply to the WebMD Mobile Device Application (or "App") including the WebMD Baby Mobile Device App for the iPhone, the iPad and mobile devices operating with the Android operating system.
</p>
<p>References to "WebMD" mean WebMD LLC, including any company that WebMD, LLC controls (for example, a subsidiary that WebMD, LLC owns).
WebMD may share information among its subsidiaries or web sites that it owns or controls, but information collected under this Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p> Information Collected About You Personal Information <p>If you choose to register or update an existing member profile with WebMD or access certain functionality on the WebMD Web Sites, you may be required to submit Personal Information.
“Personal Information” means information that we can use to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address.
Some of our interactive tools and services may request you to submit health information, which would also be considered Personal Information.
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information that you submit to WebMD.
Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the WebMD Web Sites and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p> Registration <p>Access to some WebMD interactive tools and services may be limited to users who have registered.
Some of our tools (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain your Personal Information, while others (such as Ovulation/Pregnancy Calendar) store your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the authorization you provide at the time you submit Personal Information in order to use the tool.
WebMD Health Manager, which allows you a secure place to gather, store, manage and share your Personal Information and provides tools and services to better manage your health and the health of your family, requires additional registration.
WebMD Health Manager has the ability to use Personal Information that you provide to send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages.
However,  WebMD does not allow any third parties to place beacons or cookies or to gather any data about you in connection with your use of the WebMD Health Manager.  Furthermore, WebMD does not use any information that you submit in connection with that tool to deliver any advertisements to you on or off of the WebMD Web Sites.</p>
<p>If you download the WebMD The Magazine App from the Apple App Store News Stand and agree to provide your information to WebMD, your information will be treated like that of a registered user under this Privacy Policy.</p> Newsletters &amp.
Emails to You <p>At registration and at various times as you use the WebMD Web Sites, you will be given the option of providing us with Personal Information in order to receive recurring informational/promotional newsletters – such as a newsletter relating to a specific health condition – via email from WebMD and/or directly from third parties.
In the WebMD Health Community, you can also click the “Watch This Discussion” link in any Health Community posting, and WebMD will send you an email summary of each day’s postings in that Community.</p>
<p>When you sign up for our email newsletters or at any time, you can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional newsletters from WebMD or our Sponsors.
</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from a newsletter by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter.</li>
<li>Logging in to the WebMD Web Sites and unchecking the newsletters you no longer wish to receive under the “My Profile” section.</li>
</ul>Email a Friend <p>If you use our Email a Friend service to tell a friend about a feature on the WebMD Web Sites or a newsletter, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend's email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site using your name and email address as the "from" email address.
WebMD does not use your friend's email information for any other purpose.
We will only use the information you provide to send the requested email to your friend.
</p> Market Research <p>From time to time, WebMD may conduct online research surveys through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups.
When participating in a survey, we may ask you to enter Personal Information.
The Personal Information you submit in a survey may be used by WebMD for research and measurement purposes, as described below, including to measure the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.
When our market research surveys collect Personal Information we will not knowingly accept participants who are under the age of 13.
Market research surveys conducted by or on behalf of WebMD will contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
</p> Community, Health Communities, Blogs and Other Public Forums <p>WebMD features several community areas and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer.
We also offer online discussions moderated by healthcare experts.
Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered private.</p>
<p>
<strong>Any information (including Personal Information) you share in any online community area including a chat room, Health Community, Ask Our Expert posting or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not private.
You should think carefully before posting any Personal Information in any public forum.
What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.
As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you mistakenly post Personal Information in our Community areas and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we remove it by using the <em>Contact Us</em> link on every page of the WebMD Web Sites.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information.
</strong>
</p> Emails You Send to WebMD <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to WebMD by email.
If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to WebMD.</p> Non-Personal Information <p>Even if you do not register with or provide any Personal Information to WebMD, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the WebMD Web Sites.
“Non-Personal Information” means information that we cannot use to identify or contact you.
We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users from external sources    While you may use some of the functionality of WebMD without registration, many of the specific tools and services on the WebMD Web Sites require that you register with WebMD.</p> Cookies and Web Beacons <p>We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the WebMD Web Sites and your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons.
“Cookies” are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site.
Every computer that accesses the WebMD Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by WebMD.
“Web Beacons” are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.
</p>
<p>Third parties under contract with WebMD may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the WebMD Web Sites, including which health topics you have viewed.
These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites.
WebMD may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by WebMD or these third parties.</p> Mobile Device Applications (“Apps”) <p>When you download and install one of our WebMD Mobile Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation.
This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App.
We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.
Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser.
Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings.
If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App, and please use your mobile device browser to access the WebMD Web Sites or our mobile optimized sites.
We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses.
Please note that certain WebMD Mobile Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App.
</p>
<p>WebMD’s Apps obtain your consent (via an opt-in) before using information from pin-pointing technology like GPS or cell tower information.
You can withdraw your consent (opt-out) for the use of "location" by WebMD at any time by changing your location services in the "Settings" function on your mobile device.
</p> Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on WebMD’s Behalf <p>We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our user community.
Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Web Sites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the WebMD Web Sites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you.
Their advertisements may be displayed on the WebMD Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the WebMD Web Sites.
Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the WebMD Web Sites.
</p>
<p>We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the WebMD Web Sites.
However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through the WebMD Web Sites to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from the WebMD Web Sites without your consent.
They have promised us they will not link any Non-Personal Information collected by them on the WebMD Web Sites to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program.</p> What Choices Do I Have? Updating/Removing Your Personal Information <p>If you do not want your Personal Information used by WebMD as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not register as a member or for any specific tool or application that collects Personal Information.
You can correct, update or review Personal Information you have previously submitted by going back to the specific tool or application, logging-in and making the desired change.
You can also update any Personal Information you have submitted by contacting us using the contact information listed below.
</p>
<p>If you have registered and desire to delete any your Personal Information you have provided to us from our systems please contact us using the contact information listed below.
Upon your request, we will delete your Personal Information from our active databases and where feasible from our back-up media.
You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to the WebMD Web Sites from our servers.
</p>
<p>If you decide that you would prefer not to receive personalized email or secure electronic messages from the WebMD Health Manager tool, you may "Opt-out" of the service by clicking on the settings tab on your Health Manager home page and changing your email preference or following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</p> Cookies <p>Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the WebMD Web Sites may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use the WebMD Web Sites.
It is important to note that in order to use the opt-out services described below, such as the Network Advertising Initiative and the TRUSTed Ads Program, you must not reject all Cookies because these opt-out procedures work by placing Cookies on your browser that enable these opt-out procedures to function.
The “opt-out Cookies” are placed, for example, in order to help prevent the placement of Cookies used for the targeting of advertising.</p>
<p>Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of Cookies.
In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with each individual site.
Currently, you can opt out of Cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site or TRUSTe’s Preference Manager at http://preferences.truste.com/.
This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies.
You can find additional information and resources about how to opt out of advertising and related Cookies by visiting the World Privacy Forum's Site.<u>
</u>
</p> TRUSTed Ads Program Ad Choices <p>In order to give you more control over your privacy choices we have implemented the TRUSTed Ads™ program from TRUSTe.
At the bottom of every page of the WebMD Web Sites you will see an Ad Choices logo, (which looks like this: ).
By clicking on that logo you will be presented with a window (the “TRUSTe Window”) that will identify all of the companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the WebMD Web Sites as well as on third-party sites.
If you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window.
By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements.</p> How Information Collected About You Is Used <p>Information collected by WebMD about you is used by WebMD to: </p>
