If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the previous calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2005 will receive information regarding 2004 sharing activities).<br>

<strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong>
<br> Our Website is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18.
MBUSA does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal Information from children under the age of 18.
In addition, no part of this Website is designed with the purpose of attracting any person under age 18.

<br>
<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>
<br> We may use Pixel Tags on our Website and may permit third parties to place them on our Website to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes.
A Pixel Tag, also known as a "Web bug", is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document, or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site.
Web beacons are often invisible to the visitor because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document, or email message.
Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page.
visitors can click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon.<br>
<br> Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, and the time it was viewed.
Web beacons can also be linked to Personal Information.
For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile.
Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular website.
Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.<br>
