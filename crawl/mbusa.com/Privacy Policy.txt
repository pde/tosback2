<b>Pixel Tags<br>
</b>We may use Pixel Tags on our Site and may permit third parties to place them on our Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes.
A Pixel Tag, also known as a "Web bug", is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document, or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site.
Web beacons are often invisible to the visitor because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document, or email message.
Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page.
visitors can click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon.<br>
<br>
Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, and the time it was viewed.
Web beacons can also be linked to Personal Information.
For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile.
Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular website.
Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.</p>
