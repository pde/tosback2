(“FiftyOne”).  FiftyOne will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the U.S.
- EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S.

FiftyOne will notify macys.com of the approval of your order, and macys.com will then ship approved orders to FiftyOne.  Simultaneously, FiftyOne will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you.
In this process, FiftyOne makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with FiftyOne’s terms and conditions.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.<br>
<br>
Once you agree that FiftyOne may share your personal information with macys.com, that data is protected by this notice of privacy practices and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.  <br>
<br>
We adhere to both the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.  We have certified to the U.S.
Department of Commerce, the European Union and Switzerland that our processing of personal data is in compliance with these principles and we perform periodic self-assessments to verify ongoing compliance.<br>
