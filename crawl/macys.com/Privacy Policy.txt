<p>OUR USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES<br>
<br>
The following section describes various types of technologies we use when you interact with us online, through our mobile applications, shop in our stores, or use our wireless services, and your choices regarding those technologies:</p>
<p>
<br>Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Flash Cookies (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)<br>
On our websites and other digital platforms, we use Cookies, Pixel Tags, and more limitedly, Flash Cookies.
This section briefly describes each:<br>
<br>
A Cookie is a small piece of computer code sent by a website and stored on the hard disk of your computer.
A pixel tag (also known as a tracking pixel, web beacon, or clear GIF) is an embedded image on a website that may register a user's website activity.
A Flash Cookie (also known as a Local Shared Object) is a data file stored on your computer by the websites that you visit (click here for more details).
Flash Cookies provide similar functionality as Cookies, but are based on different technology, provide richer data collections, and are persistent.
they do not go away when you exit your browser and generally cannot be deleted through your browser option tools.<br>
<br>
At Macyâs we use two kinds of Cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open.
We use session cookies, for example, to manage items added to your shopping bag.
Persistent cookies last from visit to visit.
they do not go away when you exit your browser.
We use persistent cookies to enable an easier log-in process, give you a more personalized shopping experience, or help you navigate our website more efficiently.
For example, we use persistent cookies to show you items you have previously browsed.
From time to time, we may use Flash Cookie(s) on our website(s), for example, to enable or control richer Flash-based content.</p>

If you block cookies from macys.com, you will not be able to make purchases on our websites.</p>
<p>Website Optimization Services (ADV, OPS)<br>
Macyâs shares data with Google Analytics and IBM Digital Analytics to understand and optimize website performance and enhance site usability for our customers.
These tools run in the background of our sites analyzing site usage information and then returning reports to us through an encrypted connection.
They are required to maintain data securely and confidentially, and are not permitted to share data collected with parties other than Macy's.
Credit card or password data is not collected through Google Analytics or IBM Digital Analytics.
In addition, Google Analytics may associate and group session visits to our website from various browsers and devices.<br>
<br>

<p>Interest-Based or Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) (ADV, OPS)<br>
Macyâs uses third-party advertising companies to serve interest-based advertisements.
These companies compile information from various online sources (including mobile-enabled browsers and applications) to match user profiles with ads we believe will be most relevant, interesting and timely based on that user profile.<br>
<br>
For additional information on interest-based advertising and options for managing preferences, click here.</p>
<p>Social Network &amp.
New Tech Advertising Programs (ADV)<br>
Macyâs has relationships with several social networks and new tech companies.
These companies have specific Interest-Based Ads programs that match people that have shown interest in Macyâs through our website or other services with their profiles (such as on Facebook) and platforms (such as Facebook and Google properties).  This matching allows us to deliver relevant, interest-based ads on those companiesâ networks.<br>
<br>
For information about managing your preferences for these programs, click here.</p>
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) (ADV, OPS)<br>
Macyâs does not currently recognize and process Do Not Track signals from different web browsers.
Customers may manage their preferences for tracking across sites in the Interest-Based Advertising section above.
For more information on Do Not Track please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org/.</p>
<p>Macyâs Mobile Applications (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)<br>
Macyâs offers mobile applications that you may download from your phone or smart deviceâs âapp storeâ as well as apps that you can download from your Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart television).  <br>
<br>
Macyâs mobile applications, with your permission, may use your deviceâs camera, microphone, or location information to enable features or services.  For example, geolocation (e.g., GPS) can help you find a nearby store or learn about upcoming nearby store events.
Another example is in-store locations using Bluetooth signals to connect to our Beacons or our In-Store Wi-Fi Services, which can help you while inside our store to find nearby products or receive real-time offers.<br>
<br>
Macyâs Mobile Application Preferences are managed in the Macyâs application and through your device's settings.</p>
<p>Beacons (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)<br>
Beacons are small appliances that we use to enhance and make the Macyâs in-store experience more interactive.
Beacons broadcast a Bluetooth signal that can be received by Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone, when those devices are within proximity of a beacon.
Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data.
they only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works.
In-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept Push Notifications (sometimes shown as âPNSâ on your devices), must be enabled for a Beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device.
Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Macyâs as well as other non-Macyâs applications and advertisers.<br>
<br>
Beacon Preferences are managed through your device (Bluetooth, Location, and PNS settings).</p>
<p>In-Store Wi-Fi Services (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)<br>
Many Macyâs locations offer free Wi-Fi Services to visitors.
Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from devices that interact with the router.Some examples of data automatically collected through our Wi-Fi Service include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your device, including a MAC Address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.</li>
<li>Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.  </p>
<p>RFID (FUL, OPS, SEC)<br>
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects.
RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data.
Macyâs uses RFID for inventory management (such as locating shoes in the stock room) and logistics support.
RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.<br>
<br>Video Cameras (FUL, OPS, SEC)<br>
We use cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection.
We also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as such as traffic pattern analysis.
Cameras may include technology to capture demographic information, such as age, gender and dwell time.   <br>
<br>
We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for security or law enforcement purposes.<br>
<br>Voice-Enabled Services (FUL, OPS)<br>
We may use voice-enabled services (VES) to provide you greater functionality and easier shopping experiences with services such as voice search for products (for e.g., âShow me Style &amp.
Company Handbagsâ).
VES will only be used to facilitate specific requests.
Voice files are not used to personally identify an individual and will not be associated within any individual Macy's account.
Voice files will be retained by Macy's and any third party voice-enabled service providers.</p>
<p>Voice-enabled services are opt-in by use.
If you do not wish to opt-in to VES, do not use those features.
VES do not include phone answering machine messages.</p>

<p>SAFEGUARDING INFORMATION<br>
<br>
macys.com, macysbackstage.com, and mx.macys.com have put in place various procedural, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard the information we collect and use.
We designed our technology-enabled services to accept orders only from Web and mobile browsers that permit communication through a Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
SSL is an encryption standard that provides a layer of security while information is being transmitted over the Internet.<br>
<br>
As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details regarding our security measures as this could be beneficial information to criminals and other bad actors.<br>
<br>
Be advised, no security safeguards or standards are guaranteed to provide 100% security.
You should always use appropriate self-protection measures and practice safe browsing on all websites.
For more information on how you can securely shop with us, please review our Security Tips by clicking here. The National Cybersecurity Alliance also provides comprehensive information to stay safe online.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, sometimes bad actors attempt to use our brand to create fake web pages, send fake texts or emails, and conduct other illegal activities to commit fraud or attempt to breach consumersâ security.  We actively monitor for these illegal scams and shams.
We provide FAQâs and Consumer Protection Alerts in our Customer Protection Center  (CPC) as we learn of these activities.
If you receive anything with the Macyâs brand that seems suspicious, you can check to see if there is an alert on the CPC or call our customer service department.</p>
