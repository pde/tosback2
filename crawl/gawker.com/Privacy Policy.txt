</p>
<p>Taylor Swift, god’s beacon of happiness and feeling, had a very bad night.
A night so bad that it just may end up on her next album.
This is worse than Kanye-interruption-gate: Taylor Swift didn’t win any awards at this year’s Country Music Awards.</p>
<p>TSwift was nominated for three of the night’s 12 awards.
She lost “entertainer of the year” to Blake Shelton, “female vocalist of the year” to Shelton’s wife Miranda Lambert, and “musical event of the year” to Kenny Chesney.</p>

</p>
<p>Snooki and her trusty gang are lending their spray tanned hands to help out New Jersey in the aftermath of this week’s storm.
Snooki tweeted this morning, “Cleaning my closet today to donate clothes and whatever I can do the victims affected by sandy! I’m comin with clothes!!!!”</p>
<p>Spikey-haired darling, DJ Pauly D, tweeted that today was “Jerzday” and started the hashtag #restoretheshore.
Vinny also said that he gave money to the Red Cross via text message.</p>

Sorry, the “stress relief” that you need right now.</p>   </li>
<li> Nov 1, 2012 9:34pm Tweet Storm Ravaged Staten Island Is Really Mad That the Marathon Is Still Happening <p>
</p>
<p>In the aftermath of this weekend’s storm, few places have been hit worse than Staten Island.
Anderson Cooper said on tonight’s <em>AC 360</em> that Staten Island “hasn’t got the attention it should have in the last few days” and focused most of his show on the now-found bodies of two Staten Island children who were lost in the storm.</p>
<p>But today Mayor Bloomberg announced that the New York City Marathon would still start on the Staten Island side of the Verrizano bridge.
This has been the final straw for many an angry Staten Island resident.</p>

The picture was taken on Sunday and shows Obama realizing that he dialed the wrong number while making calls from a local campaign field office during a unscheduled visit in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>He looks exhausted.</p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 8:29pm Tweet Oprah’s Favorite Things List Has Seen Better Days <p>
</p>
<p>November is finally here, which means Christmas, which lasts from November to January, is here too.
Oprah released her Favorite Things list today, right on time for the premature holiday season.
Unfortunately, this year’s splattering of ritzy items that our brokeass family would never buy for us pales in comparison to lists of years past.</p>
<p>For one thing, foodstuffs containing truffles take up five spots of the 48-item list.
Everyone knows that if you use truffle oil on <em>Chopped</em>, you get eliminated on the spot.
C’mon Oprah, what is this amateur hour?</p>

</p>
<p>Cable companies are the absolute worst, so it’s not surprising that Comcast told a woman who just lost one of her two New Jersey homes that she would be getting charged extra if she didn’t manage to return her cable box.</p>
<p>Blogger Seth Clifford gave the details of his parents woes on his personal site. His family’s Mantoloking, New Jersey, beach bungalow was swallowed up by the sea, but their main home was still standing, surrounded by gas leaks which makes it completely inaccessible.</p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 7:09pm Tweet Nate Silver’s Braying Idiot Detractors Show That Being Ignorant About Politics Is Like Being Ignorant About Sports <p>deadspincom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>By David Roher</strong>
</p>
<p>In case you haven’t been hanging around the benighted corners of the political internet lately, there’s an idiotic backlash afoot against Nate Silver, the proprietor of the FiveThirtyEight blog who made his name as one of the sharpest baseball analysts around.</p>
<p>With the election just a few days away, analysis based on state poll aggregation—Silver’s included—suggests that Barack Obama is a heavy favorite against Mitt Romney.
The president holds a slight but strong lead in key electoral states.
This doesn’t sit well with many political pundits, who insist that the outcome is anyone’s guess and headed down to the wire.
Many of these people have directed their anger toward Silver, whose <em>New York Times</em>-hosted blog has predicted a strong probability of an Obama victory since June.
They insist he is biased or sloppy in his methodology, even though they seem unaware of how he makes his predictions and of statistical analysis in general.
They say—and I’m not kidding—he’s too gay for this sort of work.</p>
<p>In retrospect, we should’ve seen it coming.
It was only a matter of time before the war on expertise spilled over into the cells of Nate Silver’s spreadsheets.
In fact, in some ways it had already.
Turns out that nothing could have prepared Silver better for the slings and arrows of a surly and willfully obtuse pundit class than working on the fringes of sportswriting over the past decade. </p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 6:52pm Tweet A Bike Tour Through Blackout Manhattan.
Or, How to Get the Corner Booth at The Spotted Pig <p>
</p>
<p>Last night I left my warm, powered apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and biked over the Brooklyn Bridge into lower Manhattan with two friends.
It was the most perverse kind of adjusted New Yorker tourism: leave behind your quaint Brooklyn neighborhood, with unlimited burrata and cold craft beers, to see the blacked-out skyscrapers of Wall Street in the dark.
But we were getting antsy—my muscles may be atrophying by now, I think—and we wanted to see it for ourselves.</p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 6:34pm Tweet The Luckiest Meh: A Williamsburg Sandy Experience <p>
</p>
<p>
<br>Last night at Williamsburg’s most popular gay bar, the Metropolitan, it barely felt like Halloween.
It was packed with guys who weren’t in costume.
Those who were dressed up mostly came as women — some woman, any woman — which they probably don’t need Halloween as an excuse to do.
The music was normal, barely spooky.
Siouxsie &amp.
the Banshees’ “Peek a Boo” bled into a key-clashing mash-up of Madonna’s “Holiday” and Kelis’ “Milkshake.” I did hear “Thriller,” <em>the</em> sound of the season, as I headed outside into weather that was a little too warm, but perfectly crisp for Oct.
31.<br>
<br>Things are a little askew – not enough to be wildly fucked up, but it’s that small degree that makes for intense surreality.
It changes the tint so that the weirdness is vivid, despite being scant.
A giant storm crippled my great city.
It’ll be months before everything is normal, and yet from my window, it rained a little before settling into a week-long overcast funk.
I can go anywhere and get anything I need on foot.
New York is hurting and Williamsburg is, “Meh,” as ever.</p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 6:32pm Tweet <p>New York’s soda-hating mayor, Michael Bloomberg, decided to endorse President Obama for reelection this afternoon, after realizing that Republicans just don’t care about climate change.</p>
<p>Well it seems the headline writers at Fox News didn’t take too kindly to this development.
The Fox News homepage links to a story called “Bloomberg Backs Romney,” which accurately describes Bloomberg’s Obama endorsement.</p>
<p>News that’s fair and balanced.
Or just wrong.
Whichever comes first at this point really.</p>

<br>Flood Destruction in Staten Island Could Be Much Worse than We Think
<p>Post-Sandy conditions on Staten Island are both horrific and tragically underreported—many have died in mass flooding, either unwilling or unable to evacuate in time.
Now we’re getting reports that the casualties have become so bad that Egbert Intermediate School near Midland Beach has been turned into a makeshift overflow morgue.</p>

<li> Nov 1, 2012 6:10pm Tweet <p>Here’s right-wing pollster genius Dean Chambers’ projected election map, available on his website UnSkewed Polls, which “unskews” the polls by fucking with the numbers until they feel right.
Chambers projects Minnesota to go to Romney, 51-47 (“this will surprise many,” he acknowledges), a smaller margin of victory than Romney’s in Pennsylvania, 53-47: “Big time upset.” Why should we trust Chambers, who writes for the blogspam site Examiner.com and has no formal background in statistics or mathematics, over, say, <em>New York Times</em> contractor Nate Silver and his FiveThirtyEight model? “Nate Silver,” Chambers wrote last week, “is a man of very small stature, a thin and effeminate man with a soft-sounding voice that sounds almost exactly like the ‘Mr.
New Castrati’ voice used by Rush Limbaugh on his program.” Right.</p>   </li>
<li> Nov 1, 2012 5:36pm Tweet Neighbor: New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez Screwed a Different Young Lady Every Night, Loudly <p>New Jersey Sen.
Bob Menendez is the subject of a recent, much-hyped Daily Caller report alleging that he takes “sex trips” to the Dominican Republic, where at least two women say they were paid to have sex with him.
Considering the fact the Daily Caller is a perverse joke run by a ruined prodigy, this may or may not be true.
What <em>is</em> true, according to someone who was unfortunate enough to live in the unit below Menendez’s Washington, D.C., apartment, is that he would bring home a different young, attractive lady almost every night, put on a little jazz, and fuck loudly until 3 a.m.</p>
