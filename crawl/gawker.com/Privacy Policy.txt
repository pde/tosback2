</p>
<p>Two reporters/practical joke columnists (really) who worked for a Kyrgyzstan paper decided to step up their joke game in a normal, reasonable way, which was: by kidnapping the host of an popular entertainment show at gun point and forcing her to strip and dance for them.</p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 8:19pm Tweet John Cusack Developing Film About America’s Most Popular Misogynist, Rush Limbaugh <p>
</p>
<p>Active Twitter liberal John Cusack is developing a film about Rush Limbaugh, tentatively and creatively titled “Rush.” And, of course, the former Lloyd Dobler will play the popular conservative radio host/misogynistic racist himself.
As the Associated Press notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cusack as Limbaugh isn’t typecasting, politics aside.
Cusack is a slender, dark-haired 46-year-old, while Limbaugh is 61, balding and portly.
But Hollywood’s makeup experts have probably had greater challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha, yes.
All of that is true, AP.
Also, this movie will almost certainly be awful.
Production starts next year, which means it should be ready for hungover Saturday morning viewing on Netflix sometime in early 2014.</p>

Thanks to Tumblr for the help.
Thanks to those readers who enjoyed this old-school exhibition.
And thanks to the writers for being patient. </p>

<p>Two little boys who were literally swept out of the arms of their mother during the hurricane have been found dead.
But that’s not the whole story, and it gets even sadder: 39-year-old Glenda Moore, the mother of the two boys (pictured above with her husband, Damian), knocked on doors in her Staten Island neighborhood, begging for help during the hurricane.
No one would assist her, her sister claims.</p>

“Yeah, the show must go on,” he said while wearing a hat that was just a tiny bit too small for his head.
Interesting, Ricky Martin, very interesting opinion you have there.

<p>He then posed with a girl in a pink jacket, touched her head affectionately, and vanished into the crowd. </p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 6:05pm Tweet It’s Time for New York to Invade Connecticut and Steal All Their Gas <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Even as power slowly returns, Post-Sandy New York City remains a desperate snarl of lines for fuel and transportation.
But we hear that just to the northeast lies a pristine land of plenty: Connecticut.
Now we must ask: Is it time for New York to invade The Constitution State?</p>
<p>After soliciting horror stories from the New York City gas shortage  earlier today, we received not one, but two emails from people bragging… er, informing us of Connecticut’s vast petroleum reserves.
There, fuel flows like the sap of sugar maples on a crisp New England night.
Sweet, sweet gas.</p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 5:41pm Tweet Here Is a List of People Bubba The Love Sponge’s Ex-Wife Is Also Rumored To Have Had Sex With On Camera <p>
</p>
<p>After we posted a brief clip of Hulk Hogan’s sex tape last month, TMZ reported that there were three other tapes made.
We actually heard there were more than that.
Soon after the initial Hulk Hogan not-so-sex-filled “sex tape” was published on Gawker, a man who called himself “Jim Janerro” wrote to us.
He claimed he had more footage of Bubba’s wife getting it on in the same bedroom with numerous other partners, including other scenes with her and Hogan. He said there were “lots of black guys” involved, too.
“Jim” claimed he found the tapes in a box of promotional DVDs he purchased at the annual Bubba Army Garage Sale last year.</p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 5:18pm Tweet <p>Multiple outlets are reporting—on Twitter—that Sunday’s New York City Marathon has been cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy complications.
With many people questioning whether a marathon was a wise use of resources in a time of relative scarcity, this was probably a good decision by the mayor’s office.</p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 4:50pm Tweet Flight’s Shallow Depth <p>
<br>
<br>A junky argues with her landlord while the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ heroin ballad “Under the Bridge” plays in the background.
Then, when she shoots up, we hear a cover of the Velvet Underground’s “Sweet Jane.” An alcoholic druggie purges his stash and looks longingly at wedding pictures for a marriage that eventually failed to the strains of Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine.” A drug dealer is brought in to deliver some hangover-busting cocaine and the refreshed drunk rides the elevator down from his hotel room to a muzak version of “With a Little Help from My Friends.”<br>
<br>The obviousness of <em>Flight</em>’s soundtrack is a great indication of Robert Zemeckis’ film’s overall triteness.
This is a movie of soap opera eyes during an embrace that leads to a Dear John letter.
A movie where Denzel Washington does a drunken mumble that’s so put on, I wonder if he’s ever actually seen a drunk person before.
It’s a movie of the chin-stroking moviegoer’s favorite sensibility, shallow depth, in which a character needs only one and a half layers to carry a film that the masses will consider complexly satisfying.</p>
