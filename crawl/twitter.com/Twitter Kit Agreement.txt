<b>16.
Indemnification</b>
<p>
<b>16.1 Claims Against Developer.</b> Twitter will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, <b>“Developer Claims”</b>), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Twitter Kit Technology, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Twitter will have no obligation under this Section 16.1 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Twitter Kit Technology not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Twitter Kit Technology in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Twitter if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Twitter Kit Technology by any person other than Twitter or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Twitter Kit Technology itself.
This Section 16.1 states Twitter’s entire liability and Developer’s sole and exclusive remedy for all third party claims.</p>
<p>
<b>16.2 Claims Against Twitter.</b> Developer will defend Twitter from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, <b>“Twitter Claims”</b>) and will indemnify Twitter and hold Twitter harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Twitter Claims, that arise out of Developer’s (a) access or use of the Twitter Kit Technology.
(b) actual or alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of the rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights.
and (c) breach of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation Developer’s representations and warranties set forth in Section 14 above.
Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Twitter Claims, subject to Twitter’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from such Twitter Claims, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Twitter Claims without Twitter’s prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Twitter from any obligation or liability.
If Developer uses the Twitter Kit Technology in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>
<b>16.3 Procedure.</b> The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim.
(b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations.
and (c) cooperating and, at other party’s request and expense, assisting in such defense.
Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party’s prior written approval.
The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (x) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (y) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (z) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.</p>
<b>17.
Limitation of Liability</b>
<ol>
<li>IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL, OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.</li>
<li>IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).</li>
<li>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.
INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
