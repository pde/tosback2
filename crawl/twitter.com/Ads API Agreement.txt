<li>The applicable defined metrics for a given Campaign Objective (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this <u>Exhibit A-2</u>) must be shown every time a campaign is displayed within the Company Service.</li>
<li>If the Company Service displays any organic Tweet analytics data, Company must comply with the Twitter Developer Agreement &amp.
Policy located at: https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy as it relates to Company’s implementation, use and display of the organic Tweet analytics data.</li>
<li>If the Company Service displays metrics about campaigns run on third party networks or by third party publishers (i.e., “cross-channel metrics”) side-by-side with Data, then the following requirements and restrictions apply: <ol>
<li>Any cross-channel metrics displayed alongside the Data in the Company Service can only include the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable Twitter-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this <u>Exhibit A-2</u>).
<p>
<br>By way of example only - If an advertiser is running an app install campaign on a third-party network, only cross-channel metrics that are of the same category as the applicable Twitter-defined metrics for the app install Campaign Objective can be shown alongside the Data.</p>
</li>
<li>Aggregating data to display cross-channel metrics is not permitted unless the aggregated metrics can be referenced (across all third-party networks/publishers) against a category of metrics associated with a campaign objective that is the same to the applicable Twitter-defined Campaign Objective metrics (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this <u>Exhibit A-2</u>).
By way of example only - Aggregating total engagements for network A, network B, and network C would not be permitted if engagement rates across all channels are not calculated using the same formulas.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the Company Service displays any category of metrics sourced from third parties other than Twitter (“third-party-sourced metrics”), then the following requirements and restrictions apply: <ol>
<li>The same requirements and restrictions that apply to displaying cross-channel metrics set forth above in Section 3 apply to the display of any third-party-sourced metrics.</li>
<li>4.2.
Any third-party-sourced metrics that are displayed alongside Data for a campaign in the Company Service must be the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable Twitter-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this <u>Exhibit A-2</u>).
By way of example only: <br>- If Company displays link click and click-rate metrics from a third-party source, Company will display Twitter’s click and click-rate metrics alongside the third-party-sourced link click and click rate metrics.
<br>- If Company or any of its Clients uses a third-party tracking solution to track website clicks from Promoted Tweets and such data is displayed in the Company Service, Company must show link clicks, click rate, cost per link click and CPA from Twitter (if available) alongside such third-party-sourced data.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding Section 4.2 of this Exhibit A-2, if the third-party-sourced metrics are from a third-party tracking solution provided by a Twitter Conversion Tracking Partner (as defined below), then Twitter requires that only the Data delivered through the Twitter Ads API (and not any corresponding data delivered by the Twitter Conversion Tracking Partner) is displayed in the Company Service, unless otherwise agreed by Twitter in writing in advance (in each instance).
For the avoidance of doubt, Company will not display any data sourced from a Twitter Conversion Tracking Partner alongside, or in place of, any Data delivered through the Twitter Ads API.
As used in this <u>Exhibit A-2</u>, “Twitter Conversion Tracking Partner” means an authorized Twitter conversion tracking partner (as designated by Twitter, in its sole and absolute discretion).</li>

<strong>
<u>Exhibit B: Individual Product Terms/Tailored Audiences</u>
</strong>
<p>Capitalized terms not defined in these Individual Product Terms have the meaning set forth in the main body of the Agreement.
To the extent that Company uses or accesses the Twitter Tailored Audiences Program the following terms and conditions of this <u>Exhibit B</u> will apply: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Tailored Audiences.</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Introduction.</strong> The Twitter Tailored Audiences Program allows for the import and creation of specific segments of users (each a “<strong>Tailored Audience</strong>”) for the targeting of advertising Campaigns on the Twitter Service.
The parties acknowledge that in order to utilize Twitter’s Tailored Audiences Program, Company, its Client, or a third party service provided approved by Twitter (“<strong>Data Partner</strong>”) is required to provide Twitter with a hashed set of users or devices (which many include email, cookies, devise IDs, tracking pixels, etc.) in order for Twitter to complete a match with Twitter users and create Tailored Audiences.
The Tailored Audiences created on behalf of a specific client(s) will be stored in each such Client’s Twitter Ads account for use by Company or Client to target, or retarget, as applicable, advertising on the Twitter Service.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Usage and Opt-Out.</strong> With respect to any data used in connection with the Tailored Audiences Program, in addition to the obligations set out in the Data Protection Addendum found at https://gdpr.twitter.com/en/dpa.html, Company agrees and, if applicable, will ensure that its Data Partner(s) agree that (i) Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have secured all necessary rights, consents, waivers and licenses for use of such data, and (ii) that Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have provided any users from whom the data is collected with legally-sufficient notice that fully discloses the collection, use, and sharing of the data Company provides to Twitter for purposes of serving ads targeting to users’ interests, and legally sufficient instructions on how users can opt out of Twitter’s interest-based advertising through the methods described here (https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405).
Data Company uses in connection with the Tailored Audiences Program and/or to create a Tailored Audience will not include any data from any user who has opted out of having his/her data used by Company, its Data Partner, or any third party on Company’s behalf.
If Company receives a user opt-out after such user was included in an audience provided to Twitter, Company must promptly, but no less frequently than once every twenty-four (24) hours, remove such user(s) from any Tailored Audience in which such user was included.
Company will provide the data in a format selected by Twitter and acceptable to Data Partner (if/as applicable).
In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company’s use of the Tailored Audiences program will be subject to the terms of the Twitter Master Services Agreement and Tailored Audiences Program T&amp;Cs and applicable policies, including Twitter’s Policies for Conversion Tracking and Tailored Audiences, at https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171365.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Program Deliverables.</strong> Company’s access to, and use of, the Twitter Tailored Audience Program is subject to its compliance with the technical instructions and program policies provided by Twitter to Company (the “<strong>Program Integration Spec</strong>”).
Company and Twitter will mutually agree on a process for Company to import or upload Tailored Audiences to Twitter.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shareable Audiences.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.1 hereinabove, as a service to Company, at Company’s request and in Company’s sole discretion, Twitter may allow Company to “share” Tailored Audiences created for Company amongst grouped Twitter advertiser accounts and/or Twitter @handles and/or otherwise with third parties on the Twitter Service.
As used herein, “sharing” an audience means that Company would instruct Twitter to, without limitation, enable grouped Twitter Advertiser Accounts and/or Twitter @handles and/or third parties to access, use, and target advertising Campaigns against the “shared” Tailored Audience.
Company represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights and authority to share any such audience data in accordance with the instructions given to Twitter by Company.
If Company is providing the audience data, and/or managing the Tailored Audiences on behalf of a third party (including, without limitation, a Client), Company represents and warrants that Company has the authority as agent for such party to use any such data on the third party’s behalf, to grant Twitter the rights described herein, and to bind such third party to the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section requires Twitter to make the functionality that enables “sharing” Tailored Audiences described herein (or any portion thereof) available at any time to Company or any other third party (including, without limitation, any Client).
</li>
</ol>
<strong>
<u>Exhibit C: Individual Product Terms/Twitter Official Partner (TOP) Program</u>
</strong>
<p>Capitalized terms not defined in these Individual Product Terms have the meaning set forth in the main body of the Agreement.
To the extent that Company participates in the “Twitter Official Partner (“<strong>TOP</strong>”)” program, the following terms and conditions of this <u>Exhibit C</u> (including <u>Exhibit C-1</u>) will apply: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Twitter Official Partner Program.</strong> If Twitter approves Company’s application for “Standard” classification status, and Company maintains such classification status throughout the Term, Twitter may, at any time, choose, in Twitter’s sole and absolute discretion, to qualify Company as part of the TOP program (or any other successor program name that Twitter may select from time to time).
For clarity, Twitter is not required to select Company to participate in the TOP program, regardless of whether Company has achieved or maintains “Standard” classification status.
Furthermore, Twitter may, at any time, choose, in Twitter’s sole and absolute discretion, to terminate or suspend Company’s participation in the TOP program for any reason upon notice to Company, in which case, Company’s eligibility to receive any benefits associated with participating in the TOP program will immediately cease (without any additional notice from Twitter).
In addition to the Twitter Trademark Guidelines that govern Company’s use of any Twitter Marks, Company must also comply with the terms and conditions set forth in <u>Exhibit C-1</u> that govern use of Badges (as defined in <u>Exhibit C-1</u>) provided by Twitter in connection with participation in the TOP program.
All Badges (as defined in <u>Exhibit C-1</u>) are deemed Twitter Marks under the Agreement.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Use of Badges Outside of TOP Program.</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, if Company is not currently qualified by Twitter (in its sole and absolute discretion) as a member of the TOP program, (i) Company is not eligible to receive any benefits associated with participating in the TOP program, including, without limitation, use of any Badges (as defined in <u>Exhibit C-1</u>) and (ii) Company is prohibited from suggesting it participates in, or has any affiliation with, the TOP program.</li>
