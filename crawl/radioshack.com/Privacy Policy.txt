Kids under 13 years of age RadioShack.
com does not seek to collect identification information about kids under 13 years of age.
If we discover such information, we will delete it.
Thus, we typically retain no identifiable information about kids.
However, if a parent believes his/her child has provided us information, simply call and that we delete it.
In order for us to find the information in our databases, you will need to provide us with the following information which will only be used to search our databases and deliver confirmation to you: Parent's Name Address Telephone Number Email Address (for confirmation) The name of the child (if you suspect a nickname was used, please provide it) If the child shares time at two addresses, you will need to provide us the second address also, along with any email addresses for the child.
In order to request deletion of identifiable information that RadioShack may have unintentionally collected about your child, please call (817)415-3200.
Please inform the service agent that you wish to delete your child's information, and supply the service agent with the necessary information as stated above.
Confirmation that information which identifies your child has been deleted will be delivered to you by e-mail, regular mail, or telephone.
PLEASE NOTE: Deleting your child's information will likely make it impossible for us to notify you or your child in the event of a recall of a product he or she purchased in violation of our policies.
So if your child purchased ANYTHING from us in spite of our efforts to prevent it, you may not wish to delete all information.
Instead, you may simply request that we correct the information by correcting the name in our records to your name rather than your child's.
In consideration of young users, it is our intention to adhere to the Better Business Bureau's "Children Advertising Review Unit" (CARU) guidelines, including its guidelines on advertising.
When you communicate with RadioShack, we make every effort to ensure your privacy and safety.
