<strong>1.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
</p>
<p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
<p>You can visit the Sites to read and learn about our products, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personally identifiable information.
However, to use certain features or to participate in any special programs, you may need to provide certain personal information.</p>
<p>The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, email address, telephone number, or home address ("Personal Information")).
For example, Toyota may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, request information, submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs") or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.
The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, ZIP Code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.
If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.</p>
<p>Blogs and Public Areas: Please remember that blogs are public areas on the Sites and chat rooms may be public areas on the Sites.
Any information posted in these areas can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users.
You should not upload or post Personal Information in these public areas.
Toyota is not responsible or liable in any way for the Personal Information posted to or transmitted through these public areas.</p>
<p>Friend to Friend: Some features on the Sites may permit you to submit information about other people.
For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered on the Sites or forward particular content from the Sites to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses.
Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>
<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, Toyota, as well as any third-party publishers or Web sites and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used (<b>"Usage Information"</b>).
Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on.
This information helps us keep our Web site fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor's interests.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>Toyota also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (<b>"Device Identifier"</b>) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, <b>"Device"</b>) you use to access the Sites.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a Web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.</p>
<p>The tracking technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include, without limitation:</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies.</em> Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.
Toyota, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tailor our communications with you, facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Sites.
Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites and pages visited.
Cookies and other tracking technologies allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Sites.
and determine the correlation between Toyota purchasers and the sites they visit.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it.
or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies.
However, please be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s).
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>
<em>Pixel tags.</em> A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a Web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a Web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed.
In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
In order to ensure the safekeeping of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly collect Personal Information on our Sites.</p>
<p>

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party Web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party Web site or interactive service.</p>

<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
YOUR CHOICES AND ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sites gives you choices.
If you choose to receive emails from us about products and other information, we strive to keep your Personal Information updated and accurate.</p>
<p>If you provided Toyota with Personal Information through the Owners section of toyota.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the homepage of toyota.com, registering or logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile." If you are an Owner who subscribes to the Toyota owner email list, you can access the Preferences page and change your user profile or unsubscribe from the Toyota email list <u>here</u>.</p>
<p>For users who are not currently registered on our owner site, please call Customer Satisfaction at 800-331-4331 to opt out from receiving email communications from Toyota.
If you receive an email, you may opt-out at any time by following the opt-out instructions provided in the email you receive.</p>
<p>If you are participating in a Program, you may be able to access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program.
Please see the section of the Sites concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.</p>
<p>In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Sites.
We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information.
In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING.
HOW TO OPT-OUT</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use third-party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers, to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content.
We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you give us permission).
Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your precise location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited.
In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information.
The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.</p>
<p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information.
To do so please visit the <u>DAA Opt-Out Page</u>.
Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13.
Toyota does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children that young.
If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit your email address or any other Personal Information to us through the Sites.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information.
However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>Beware of Phishing Scams:</em> There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious emails claiming that the email recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion.
Sometimes the email claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius.
In order to claim the prize, the email asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo email address.
Samples of these hoax emails can be found at <u>this Web site</u>.</p>
<p>This type of email solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information.
This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity.
For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users.
Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security Numbers, or other personal information through email or U.S.
mail or fax or text message.
If you receive an email or letter by U.S.
mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam.
Recipients of suspicious email like this should delete the message from their inbox and, if possible, update their email filter settings to block emails from the email address being used.
<u>The Federal Trade Commission</u> and the <u>Antiphishing Workgroup</u> are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sites include links to other Web sites, such as the Web site for Toyota Financial Services and to Web sites for Toyota dealers.
These Web sites are not under our control, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us.
Such other Web sites do not necessarily follow our Privacy Policy, and may place their own cookies on your Device.
This practice is standard on the Web, and we do not control cookies or Web beacons that may be placed on your Device by third parties whose advertising or links appear on our Sites.
These Web sites may have their own privacy and information security policy and terms and conditions.
Visitors should consult the other Web sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>11.
