If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.

<p>back to top</p> I received a suspicious email from a Gap Inc.
brand regarding an order I did not place.
What should I do? <p>We are aware of phony emails sent out under our brand names.
These emails did not originate from Gap Inc., and individuals who received fraudulent order status emails have not been charged.
For your protection, do not click links or open any files attached to suspicious, unsolicited emails.
If you believe your personal computer has been compromised as a result of the scam, please consult an IT professional.
For more information, contact the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.
We work with law enforcement on their investigations of these kinds of fraudulent emails.</p>
<p>back to top</p> I responded to an online job posting for a Gap Inc.
job that requires me to upload personal financial information.
Is this part of your hiring process? <p>No.
Gap Inc.
does not ask prospective job applicants for information about their bank accounts, credit history or passwords to financial accounts.
If you are asked for personal financial or security information in response to a job application, this is likely a fraudulent job listing hosted by spammers posing as Gap Inc.
to mislead job applicants.
You can validate all Gap Inc.
job postings on gapinc.com/careers.
Spammers also create phony aliases such as thegap-usa.com to mimic our company and/or brand names in an effort to commit identity theft or other forms of fraud.
If you receive this type of suspicious email activity, please alert the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</p>
