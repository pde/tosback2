<p>
<b>How We Collect Information </b>
</p>
<p> The information that we collect about you while you are using our Services falls into two general categories: information you provide to us, and information that is automatically collected.
All of the information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a vendor providing contractual services to us, such as a service provider. </p>
<p>1.
<i>Information You Provide to Us</i>. </p>
<p>We may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while using our Services, including information you send to us by email or other platforms in connection with a feature provided through the Services.
This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone numbers, birthdate and gender.
Some examples of this type of information include: </p>
<ul>
<li>information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes; <br>
</li>
<li>information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas accessed through our Services; <br>
</li>
<li>information and content you provide when you upload a photograph, video or audio file;<br>
</li>
<li>information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Services; <br>
</li>
<li>information that you provide within an advertisement on one of our Services.
and <br>
</li>
<li>information contained in search requests that you submit through our Services. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions through our Services.</p>
<p>2.
<i>Information that is Automatically Collected</i>. <br>
</p>
<p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services.
Some examples of this type of information include: </p>
<ul>
<li>whether you downloaded an App; <br>
</li>
<li>the source of the download of the App (for example, through a particular advertisement for the App); <br>
</li>
<li>your Deviceâ€™s connection to the Internet; <br>
</li>
<li>your browser or operating system.
â€¢which pages you visit through our Services and how often; <br>
</li>
<li>which features of our Services you interact with and how often; <br>
</li>
<li>which advertisements we serve to you and your engagement with them.
and <br>
</li>
<li>information generated when you upload a photograph, video or audio file. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, certain Devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify other information about your Device.
When you use such a Device or browser to access our Services, your Device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your Device's unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, profile information (if you connect through a social network such as Facebook), location information, the make and model of your Device, the wireless provider associated with your Device, and similar information.
We may ask you whether we may access and collect your location information even when you are not using the Services, but you may decline this request. </p>
<p>We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with our Services.
Cookies are small files that your web browser or an App places on your Device for record-keeping purposes.
By showing how and when visitors use the Services or other websites, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns.
They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences for certain Services when you have entered preference information before.
We also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who use the Services or other websites.
Additionally, we may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. </p>
<p>We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as local storage, in connection with our Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings (see below).
The method for disabling local storage will vary depending on your browser and device. </p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>3.
<i>Your Choices</i>. </p>
<p>When we request information from you through our Services, you may always choose not to provide us with that information.
But if you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using our Services, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through our Services. </p>
<p>If you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Services or other websites, most web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy settings.
If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Services. </p>
<p>You can stop all future collection of information by the Apps by uninstalling the Apps according to the procedures outlined in the Apps or on your Device. </p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>4.
<i>Collection of Information by Service Providers and Third-Party Advertising Service Providers</i>. </p>
<p>In addition, our service providers and third-party advertising service providers may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect the information listed above from our Services.
The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting through our Services does not include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, birthdate or gender unless you affirmatively provide information within the ad.
However, it may include Device identifying information such as the IP address, MAC address, cookie or other Device-specific unique ID.
These service providers also may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. </p>
<p>The collection of information by our service providers and third-party advertising service providers is governed by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by our Privacy Notice.
If you have any questions regarding the privacy notice of one of our service providers, you should contact the service provider directly for more information. </p>
<p>If you would like more information about the information collection practices of a particular third-party advertising service provider, or if you would like more information on how to opt out of a third-party advertising service providerâ€™s information collection practices, go to www.aboutads.info, or for apps, at www.aboutads.info/appchoices. </p>
<p>Additionally, some of our third-party advertising service providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI").
You can obtain more information about these third-party advertising service providers' information collection practices, and opt out of such practices (and at the same time opt out of the collection practices of other, or all, NAI members) by following the opt out instructions on the NAI's website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>
<p> Please note that one of our third-party advertising service providers is DoubleClick.
