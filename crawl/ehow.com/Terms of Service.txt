LICENSE RIGHTS
<p>You retain ownership of your copyrights and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in any User Generated Content you post to the Site, subject to the non-exclusive rights that you grant to us as described in these Terms.

<p>You acknowledge that the posting of your User Generated Content for any period of time is sufficient consideration for the license granted herein to eHow.</p>
<p>You may choose from time to time to remove or modify User Generated Content that you previously posted on the Site if doing so would not interfere with other users' ability to enjoy the Site.
For example, a request to remove your comments or posts from a long string of interactive posts could render the entire thread unintelligible and eliminate the ability of the other users of the Site to read and enjoy that thread.
In these situations, we may anonymize your User Generated Content so that the threaded conversation remains intact.
Your removal of any of your User Generated Content will automatically terminate our license to such User Generated Content.
But if prior to such removal or modification, eHow has created, or developed specific plans to create, any electronic or printed materials containing such User Generated Content (e.g., in advertising, promotion or otherwise), then you agree that eHow may continue to exploit materials containing such User Generated Content after you have removed or modified that User Generated Content.
However, six (6) months after you have removed or modified that User Generated Content, you may send us written notice to cease displaying such materials, in which event we will use commercially reasonable efforts to cease displaying such materials within thirty (30) days of our receipt of such notice.
