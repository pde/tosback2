Complaint Procedures.
<ol>
<li>Policy.
We do not tolerate any acts of intellectual property violations or allow for any child pornography or obscene or defamatory Material to be posted on this Site.
We will do our best, in good faith, to remove, disable or restrict access to, or the availability of, Material that, in our subjective view, is infringing, racist, obscene as to minors, child pornography, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violate, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.
The provisions of this Section 8 are intended to implement this policy but are not intended to impose a contractual obligation on us to undertake, or refrain from undertaking, any particular course of action.</li>
<li>Complaint Procedures.
If you believe that someone has posted Material that violates this policy (other than in cases of copyright infringement, which is addressed in Section 9), we ask you to promptly notify us by email at the following address: legal@leafgroup.com.
You must use this address if you want to ensure that your complaint is actually received by the appropriate person charged with investigating alleged policy violations.
Please provide us with sufficient detail in your complaint to allow us to effectively respond.
At a minimum, please include (i) the nature of the offending Material or right infringed.
(ii) all the facts that lead you to believe this policy has been violated or a right has been infringed.
(iii) the precise location where the offending Material is located.
(iv) in the case of infringement, any grounds that make you believe that the person who posted the Material was not authorized to do so.
and, if (v) if known, the identity of the person or persons who posted the infringing or offending Material.</li>
<li>Indemnification.
Waiver of Certain Rights.
By lodging a complaint, you agree that the substance of your complaint will be deemed to constitute a representation made under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California.

<li>Investigation/Liability Limitation.
You agree that we have the right (but not the obligation) to investigate any complaint received.
By reserving this right, we do not undertake any responsibility in fact to investigate complaints or to remove, disable or restrict access to or the availability of the Material.
We support free speech on the Internet and therefore will not act on complaints that we believe, in our subjective judgment, to be deficient.
If you believe that Material remains on this Site that violates your rights, your sole remedy will be against the person(s) responsible for posting or storing it, not against us.</li>
