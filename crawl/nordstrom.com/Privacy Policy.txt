To best serve you, we may share your personally identifiable information with other members of the Nordstrom family of companies and with service providers that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services.
Service providers, third parties who perform services on our behalf, are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from Nordstrom.
We may also, in certain instances, disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify you, contact you, or bring legal action to protect your rights or the rights of Nordstrom or others.

<p>
<strong>Personal Book</strong>
<br> One of our most valuable tools we have for building and maintaining our relationship with you is Personal Book.
It allows us to better serve you in a number of ways, including keeping you informed on when your alterations, repairs, or your favorite brands or product will arrive, and notifying you about sales, special appearances and store events or promotions of interest to you.</p>
<p>To best serve you, we record and access information in Personal Book, including your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, interests, privacy preferences and purchase history.
All Nordstrom Salespeople are expected to use Personal Book in an ethical and appropriate manner.
This includes only entering accurate customer information, voluntarily given by you to the Salesperson, for the specific purpose of entering it into Personal Book or any other Nordstrom-approved data device.</p>
<p>Personal Book allows our Salespeople to follow through on our commitment to serving you in a professional manner, and we are dedicated to ensuring that the information you provide is protected and secure.
Personal Book is the property of Nordstrom and may be used for Nordstrom-related purposes only.</p>
<p>
<strong>Mobile Privacy</strong>
<br> Nordstrom offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Nordstrom.
<strong>All personal information collected by Nordstrom via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy.</strong>
</p>
<p>Although you do not have to provide your location information to Nordstrom to use our mobile applications, our store-specific services such as find-an-item require a zip code to function.
You may manually enter a zip code and we will save your zip code(s) for future reference.
Alternatively, when you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location from your mobile device when you click the "near me" button.
In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device.
We do not store precise location data.
we only store the zip code associated with the location.
We may also update our mobile applications to offer automatic (or "push") notifications.
We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Nordstrom.
If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of you device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>
<p>In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality.
Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.</p>

<strong>Fraud Alerts: Protecting Your Personal Information</strong>
<br> You may come in contact with websites, e-mails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information with the offer of a Nordstrom gift card.
Nordstrom does not sponsor these offers nor are we affiliated with the promotion originators.
If you become aware of any potentially fraudulent activity on a website or in an e-mail or text, please forward the information to onlinefraud@nordstrom.com or call us at 1-888-282-6060 so that we can follow up.
We take these matters, and the protection of our customers' sensitive information, very seriously.

<p>
<strong>International Customer Privacy</strong>
<br> Protecting the privacy and security of Nordstrom customer information is a top priority for Nordstrom.
In some cases, Nordstrom partners with outside vendors to help facilitate transactions.
When that is the case, we work closely with the vendor to ensure that the transaction is appropriately handled and all the information you provide is treated with the utmost care.</p>
<p>To sell and fulfill online purchases that customers choose to ship internationally, Nordstrom partners with FiftyOne, Inc.
("FiftyOne").
We have contracted with FiftyOne to assure that they will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission.
FiftyOne also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for executing international shipping orders.
When you identify your Nordstrom.com order as being shipped internationally, Nordstrom will facilitate your secure Checkout transaction with FiftyOne.
On the Checkout page you will be required to submit credit card and personal information (name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address and phone number) to FiftyOne to complete your order.
Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from Nordstrom.</p>
<p>Upon completion of your order, FiftyOne will notify Nordstrom of the approval of your order, and Nordstrom will then ship approved orders to FiftyOne.
Simultaneously, FiftyOne will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you.
In this process, FiftyOne makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with FiftyOne's terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered.</p>
<p>Once you have agreed that FiftyOne may share your data collected from their page with Nordstrom, that data is protected by the Nordstrom Privacy Policy.
Any personal information you provide directly to Nordstrom while on Nordstrom.com is controlled and processed by Nordstrom, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986.
Any personal information provided at Checkout is controlled and processed by FiftyOne, 55 West 39th Street, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10018.</p>
<p>If you choose to provide Nordstrom with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.
Nordstrom adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Authority.
We conduct an annual self-assessment to verify that we are in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles in addition to our own Nordstrom privacy program assessments.
Nordstrom has certified to the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the European Union that our processing of personal data is in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as has FiftyOne.
For more information about the Safe Harbor, visit the Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website.
While the Safe Harbor Principles are designed to protect personal information originating in the European Economic area and Switzerland, our policy is to protect all international customer information in accordance with these Principles.</p>
<p>Customers shipping internationally who wish to inquire about or update personal information or change marketing preferences, or anyone who wants to receive information about our international privacy program should contact us directly using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>• Send an e-mail to intl_privacy@nordstrom.com, or<br> • Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or<br> • Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986</p>
<p>In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Nordstrom commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Nordstrom using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an e-mail to intl_privacy@nordstrom.com, or</li>
<li>Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or</li>
<li>Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986</li>
</ul>
<p>Nordstrom has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Nordstrom, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Transitions</strong>
<br> As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets.
In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
In the unlikely event that Nordstrom, Inc.
or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your Personal Information can continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Policy Changes</strong>
<br> This policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our information practices.
We reserve the right to change this policy, and to apply any changes to information previously collected, as permitted by law.
If there are material changes to this policy or our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the policy changes on our website.</p>
<p>
<strong>Additional Information</strong>
<br> If you're not comfortable shopping online (and would prefer to make your purchase via telephone), just give us a call at 1-888-282-6060.
