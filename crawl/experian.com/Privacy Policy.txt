<b>Experian Privacy Policy:</b>
</p>
<p>Experian is one of the national credit reporting agencies.
Our credit-reporting business is regulated by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and companion state laws.
We are also held accountable by various other laws and industry standards as well as your expectations.
We are sensitive to your interest in privacy, and we are committed to letting you know what information is being collected, how the information is being used, and in providing you choices in the use of the information.
Each time we request identification information from you, we will explain why we are asking and how we will use your information.
The online personal credit report service is provided to consumers in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and with Experian's Information Values.
For a full explanation, you may link to Experian's Information Values at the bottom of this page.

<b>Collection And Use Of Your Information For Ordering A Credit Report and/or Score</b>
<br> We will not release an individual's personal credit report and/or score without verifying the identity of the requester, and we will make every effort to verify that the requester is the subject of the requested report and/or score.
We require that you provide us with the requested personal information during the online ordering process to help ensure that we provide your credit report and/or score only to you.
Additionally, we will ask you several multiple choice questions about your credit history and other information that only you should know.
We cannot deliver your personal credit report and/or score online if you do not provide us with this information or if you provide us with incorrect information.
We take these precautions for your privacy and security protection.  If you are unable to order your credit report and/or score through this online system, we may contact you at the address we have on file to assist you in obtaining your credit report and/or score in another manner.  We may also contact any user of this online system for audit and verification purposes in order to comply with laws and regulations governing the credit reporting industry.
For example, we may institute random mail or telephonic confirmations to ensure that our system is secure.</p>
<p>The personal information you provide to us in connection with ordering your credit report and/or score online will not be shared with any third parties, except as permitted by law.
Your information may be shared with an Experian affiliate for fulfillment of your request and will not be used for any other purpose except as permitted by law, which may include without limitation sharing or other uses with your consent.
Non-personal data may be used to develop enhancements to this product and other Experian consumer products.
We may use data to make changes to our product, as deemed necessary to continue to ensure your security and privacy online. </p>
<p>
<b>This Is For Your Security And Your Protection.
Collection And Use Of Your Information For Requesting An Investigation</b>

<p>
<b>Storage Of Your Information</b>
<br> Experian will store the information you provide to us during your visit for fraud detection and verification purposes.
We will store your email address and online personal credit report number in order to facilitate the processing of a request for investigation.
If you provide your email address, Experian will store it with your online credit report number so that we can notify you when your investigation is completed.
Your email address does not become part of your credit information and will not be shared with third parties except for legal and subpoena purposes, which may include without limitation sharing or other uses with your consent.

<b>Security<br>
</b>Experian protects your information over the Internet by using a secure web server, which allows your web browser programs (i.e.

Experian employs a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and Experian.
The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cipher text to safeguard your sensitive and private information during its journey across the Internet.
The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination, your computer.</p>

Any time that you are on a registration page or viewing your personal credit report, you will be in a secure area.</p>
<p>Additionally, Experian restricts access to information that you provide only to those employees who need to know such information to provide and process the information you have requested or to investigate matters you have requested be investigated.
Experian maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your information.
Experian also utilizes systems access controls to protect your information.
Experian continually monitors access to its systems to detect unauthorized attempts to gain access to information.</p>
