Although some of the personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g., an address is required to buy goods and services from pch.com), in some cases some of the information is optional.
Users can determine to some extent what information they wish to submit.
In addition to the initial registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer optional questions about products and services.
We gather this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.
<p>Through the use of “cookies” “pixel tags” "flash cookies" (described below) and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on, among other things, the following information:</p>

What are Cookies?</b>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory.
The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on most major web sites, pch.com may place and store Internet cookies on a user's hard drive.
Cookies can save any of the types of information noted above.
Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on the pch.com site.
For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to pch.com, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate our audience size.
We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied at registration.
Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie.
Please note, however, that certain areas on the site will not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.
<p>“Pixel tracking“, a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding.
Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics.
A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity.
We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests.
For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to the PCH site.
If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web site.
This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
Personal information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us.</p>
<p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.
Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.
Some of our business partners (e.g., tracking utility company) use cookies on our site.
We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.
