<strong>When you register</strong>
<br>
When you register to join in our forums, post photographs in the gallery or sign up for our newsletter it is necessary for us to collaect some personal data from you. <br>
<br>
<strong>What data we collect and why we have it</strong>
<br>
When you sign up for an ePHOTOzine account, your personal details are submitted to our secure server which is located in a secure data centre.
This is protected by HTTPS encryption.
Staff members and moderators of ePHOTOzine may access this data when necessary, for example to contact you if you submit a report or to send you a prize.
Below is a list of the data we collect and why we keep it.<br>
<br>
<strong>Name –</strong>We need a name to identify you should you win a prize or should you contact us because you've forgotten your password.
we may need to verify who you are by cross-checking your name with a form of ID for security purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Email –</strong>We require an email address from you at sign up for verification purposes.
We also use this email address to contact you where applicable.
We can also send you our informative weekly editorial newsletter and any offers we think you might be interested in, if you are signed up to receive these.
We take your privacy extremely seriously and will never sell your details to third parties.
You can opt out of our newsletters at any time.
We also send out automatic notification emails regarding your use of the site (such as to inform you of comments on your pictures.
updates to your forum posts etc).
Again, you can unsubscribe from these at any time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Address –</strong>We ask for an address so that if you win a prize in either our regular site competitions or the Christmas prize draw, the prize can be sent out quickly and easily.
In some instances we may not be able to confirm all address details with winners before sending prizes out, so we ask that you keep this information up to date.
We will not be held responsible if you win a prize and it is sent out to the wrong address due to the information not being up to date.
Supplying your address is optional.
However not supplying your address may result in your competition entries being void.<br>
<br>
<strong>Date of birth –</strong>ePHOTOzine sends out a free week’s worth of Plus Membership redeemable through a code as a birthday perk.
By providing your date of birth you are authorizing us to send this to your email address.
We occasionally use this data to generate anonymous demographics of the average age of users to help us tailor content and advertising better.
Your birthday is also used to verify your age so that you may turn off the adult content blocker if you wish.
You can choose not to give us your date of birth however this will mean that you don't get a week's free Plus Membership for your birthday.
Because we can't verify your age without your birthday, you will also lose the ability to see images that are classed as adult on the site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where you came from –</strong> We keep a referrer URL (where you came from on the web when you sign up for an account) so that we can look at how our users reach us and optimise the site for the best user experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gender –</strong>This data is used in anonymous demographic collections so we can tailor content better to our users.
Providing your gender is optional.<br>
<br>
<strong>Favourite drink/colour/gadget etc. </strong>These are completely optional as to whether you fill them out and are not used in any data collections – these answers are just for fun and to help add a bit of personality to your profile.
You can edit them at any time by going to your profile settings.<br>
<br>
<strong>Closed profile data</strong>
<br>
When you close your ePz account, the account data is stored on our secure servers.
It is removed from ePHOTOzine and is not searchable or accessible from the site.
We keep the profile data and the photos uploaded to it in case you change your mind and ask to have the profile re-opened.<br>
<br>
If you wish to have us destroy your profile and remove all data from our servers, you must request that we do so either by email or through the on-site report system and we will take the appropriate action to ensure this is carried out.
Please note that once the action has been requested you will not be able to revive your profile and all your data will be permanently deleted.
This is an irretrievable process.
We ask that you think very carefully before making this decision as we will not be able to help with retrieving images from your profile.<br>
<br>
When you sign up to ePHOTOzine the data remains on our server permanently, unless you ask that the data be destroyed.<br>
