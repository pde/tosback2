<strong>Information Collected Through Our Services</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Information You Provide Directly Through Our Services</em>

<p>We and service providers working on our behalf will collect any information that you choose to provide directly through our Services, including your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, password, age, payment card information, country of residence, communications and content preferences and your favorite Member stations.
For example, such information may be collected when you:</p>

<li>If you choose to participate in a survey, we may ask you to provide your date of birth, gender, education level, information about your employment, income level and other information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other non-profit organizations, we also track donation activity on an individual basis.
Accordingly, if you choose to donate to NPR or an NPR Member station through the NPR Services, or express interest in or request information about making donations, we may keep a record of these contacts that includes your name, contact information and other information about your donation or inquiry.
If you choose to donate to an NPR Member station, your information may be collected directly by NPR and/or by that Member station and, if collected by the Member station, subject to the Member station's privacy policy.</p>
<p>We also may ask you to provide other information about yourself for various other purposes that we specify or make apparent at the time of collection.</p>
<p>
<em>Information Automatically Collected Through Technology </em>
</p>
<p>We and service providers working on our behalf automatically collect certain information about your computer or device and your interactions with our Services through access logs, cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies.
Depending on which NPR Services you use and how you access them, the information collected automatically may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet Protocol address (IP address) of the computer or device you used to access the NPR Services or play podcasts or other media content downloaded through our Services.</li>
<li>The domain name of your Internet Service Provider.</li>
<li>The website, application, platform or service you visited before and after visiting an NPR Service.</li>
<li>Search terms you enter using the NPR Services or on a referring website.</li>
<li>Your approximate geographic location information (derived from request header information, such as your IP address) and/or more precise information about the specific location of your device if you have given NPR explicit consent to receive this information for an NPR application on your mobile device.</li>
<li>The make, model, carrier and unique device identifier for your mobile device, the unique advertising identifier (for example, the Apple IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) or Google Advertising ID) that allows mobile applications running on your mobile device to gather data for purposes of serving targeted advertising or personalized or "interest-based" sponsorship credits, and other information about your computer or mobile device and its browser, operating system, settings and software.</li>
<li>Automobile make (for certain connected car platforms).</li>
<li>The dates, times, duration, and frequency of your interactions with our Services.</li>
<li>Your navigation path through the NPR Services, including any "favorites" you select, and patterns in the paths you take.</li>

<li>The amount of time spent listening to or viewing media files or pages.</li>
<li>Listening data collected both when you download and listen to podcasts or other media files.
Listening data includes descriptions of the title, episodes, segments and sponsorship credits included in a podcast or other media file, time and date stamps for download and playback events (for example, when a file is downloaded and when playback of a particular segment or sponsorship credit starts, stops, is skipped or is paused), the mobile advertising identifier for your device (for example, the Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID), session IDs and information about the device or platform used to download or play a particular file.
The producers of any independently produced podcasts we distribute may also collect the same types of listening data subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours.</li>

<li>Any errors you encountered during your use of our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information about our use of cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies can be found here and in the section that follows.</p>
<p>
<strong>Analytics Data Collection</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Services also make use of third-party analytics, cookie data collection and linking services (collectively "Analytics Services"), including Google Universal Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, Remarketing with Google Analytics, and DoubleClick for Publishers.
These Analytics Services may use cookies, pixel tags, and other tracking and storage technologies to collect or receive information (not including your name or the email address you register with NPR) from our Services and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to analyze and measure our audience and target and evaluate the effectiveness of sponsorship credits.
For example, NPR and Analytics Services may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the Remarketing with Google Analytics and DoubleClick cookies) together to inform, optimize, and serve sponsorship credits based on your past interactions with our Services and other websites or services.
In addition, we may use analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographic, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other operational purposes.
Each Analytics Service's ability to use and share analytics information is restricted by such Analytics Service's terms of use and privacy policy.
To learn more about how Google uses data, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Information about opting out of Google Universal Analytics is included in the "Your Choices" section below.

<strong>How We Disclose Information</strong>
</p>
<p>NPR is committed to maintaining your trust.
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share information about you that is collected through our Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>User Materials.</em>
</strong> Any User Materials you submit through our Contact Us page, social networking services or similar features can be seen, collected and used by us and anyone else who has access to the applicable service.
Such information is likely to become public and we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use.
Any User Materials you submit may also be freely used and shared by NPR and its Member stations and their respective licensees in accordance with our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Member stations.</em>
</strong> NPR may share your name, email address, other contact information, and information about your listening activity, donations and interests with the Member stations that are associated with your account or that are local to you.
When we do so, we require those Member stations to commit to the same policies regarding further sharing with third parties that we follow under this Privacy Policy.
If you do not want us to share your name, contact information, or other information, including information about your donations to NPR, with Member stations, you can contact us any time.
However, if you choose to donate to an NPR Member station through our Services, your information may be collected directly by that Member station.
In that case, the collection of your information is subject to that Member station's privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Authorized service providers.</em>
</strong> We may share any information we collect with service providers who provide us with specialized services or otherwise help us operate our Services including, without limitation, service providers that provide customer support, email deployment, account sign-in services, payment processing, order fulfillment, analytics, marketing, suppression list management, contest management and data processing services.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Authorized third-party applications.</em>
</strong> We may share with authorized third-party applications information that you provide directly through our Services and information collected automatically through technology for the purpose of providing certain NPR Services to you on the applications.
In such cases, the information that we share may include your name, favorite stations, and listening activity.
NPR prohibits the third-party developers of those applications from accessing, storing or sharing any such non-public information.
However, please be aware that your use of the third-party application is otherwise subject to the third-party application's privacy policy, which we do not control and which may differ significantly from ours.
NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party application and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any third-party sites, applications, platforms, and services that you visit or access.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Business transfers.</em>
</strong> We may share any collected information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of an NPR Service or division, a merger, a consolidation, an asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Legal requirements.</em>
</strong> We may disclose any collected information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Protect our Services and users.</em>
</strong> We may disclose any collected information to enforce our Terms of Use and to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of NPR, NPR Member stations, their respective employees, agents, contractors, sponsors, listeners and users, members of the general public, or others.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>With your consent.</em>
</strong> We may share any collected information when you expressly or implicitly consent to such disclosure.
For example, if you use our Services to email or text a story to a friend, we would disclose your name to that friend together with the content you directed us to send.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers.</em>
</strong> Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers also may collect contact and other information and precise location data from our mobile services users through processes we do not control.
You should check the privacy policies of your wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers for additional information.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Podcast producers.</em>
</strong> We may share with third-party producers listening and other data that does not identify you that we collect through your interaction with the podcasts and other media files produced by those third-party producers.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Bitly.</em>
</strong>
<em>
</em>NPR uses a service called Bitly to create shortened uniform resource locators ("URLs" – the "addresses" of individual web pages) for our content so that it can be shared easily, particularly through social media.
Bitly collects information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on, including IP addresses, general location information, the time and day each shortened URL is accessed, and the social media or other channels through which our content is shared.
If you have established a separate account with Bitly, Bitly may associate the foregoing information with personal information it has stored in your Bitly account in accordance with Bitly's own privacy policy.
To share our content without using Bitly, copy the full URL of the story you want to share from your browser and paste it into your email, text or social media message.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Aggregated and anonymous information.</em>
</strong> Subject to applicable law and your opt-out choices described below, and as we deem appropriate, we may share with third parties or allow them to collect directly any aggregated or other information that does not directly identify you as an individual.
Such information may be used and combined with other information collected by the receiving parties pursuant to their own respective privacy policies, which we don't control.
For example, we may share or authorize the collection of such information by service providers that help us analyze and improve our Services, provide us and other digital media organizations with ratings and ranking data, help us to create personalized content, or tailor sponsorship credits to your interests.
We may also share or authorize the collection of such information by sponsors or their agencies to help them measure the impact of their sponsorship campaigns.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Choices</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the following choices to update, correct and limit the collection and use of information gathered through our Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Don't volunteer information.</em>
</strong>
<em>
</em>If you do not consent to the collection, use or sharing of your contact and other information as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the NPR Services or provide information to us.
By using the NPR Services or providing information to us through the NPR Services, you are "opting in" to the collection, use and sharing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Registration information</em>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong> Sign in to your NPR account or contact us to correct or update any registration information you provided to us, opt out of future email newsletters from us, or cancel your NPR account, NPR newsletter subscription or other NPR registrations.
For your protection, we may only act on requests with respect to the registration data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may ask you to verify your identity before implementing your request.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a correction, update or cancellation.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Donation information</em>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong> If you are a donor to NPR and do not want us to share your name, contact information or other information with any Member station, you can opt out of such sharing at the time you make the donation or you can contact us any time.
However, if you choose to donate to an NPR Member station through our Services, your information may be collected directly by that Member station.
In that case, the collection of your information is subject to that Member station's privacy policy.</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Interest-based messages.</em>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>To opt out of receiving personalized or "interest-based" online sponsorship credits from our service providers and other participating companies, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

<strong>
<em>Precise location information</em>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong> If you consent to our collection of your precise device location through an NPR mobile application, you can withdraw your consent at any time and prevent the further collection of your precise location by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device and/or the settings of the NPR mobile application.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.
Instead, we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and offer the choices described above.</p>
<p>
<strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<p>We employ physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards in an effort to secure the information we collect.
These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information.
Because no security system is impenetrable, however, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases or that information you supply will never be intercepted, accessed, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
Because most email and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email, text messages, or other mobile transmissions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Links to and from Other Sites and Services</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Services contain links to other sites, applications, platforms and services operated by third parties whose privacy policies we don't control and may differ significantly from ours.
For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship credit or some third-party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not.
You also may access NPR content and the NPR Services from a third-party site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not.
NPR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party services and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any such sites or services you visit or access.</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Networking Services Sign-in and Sharing Tools</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Services allow users to sign in to their NPR accounts using their credentials on social networking services such as Facebook and Google+ (each an "SNS").
If you sign in to our Services through an SNS, we will receive your email address and certain profile information from such SNS in accordance with its privacy policy and your SNS account privacy settings.
Any information that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have selected with that SNS, so please consult the applicable SNS's privacy and data policies to learn how to manage these settings.</p>
<p>If you use tools on our Services that allow you to share stories or other content with your friends and followers on an SNS such as Facebook, Twitter, Flipboard, or Google+, that action and any information you share may be used by the SNS according to its own privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>NPR reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.
Any changes will be posted to this page, so please check back periodically.
Your use of our Services constitutes consent to the Privacy Policy then in effect.
Please read NPR's Terms of Use to understand additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of our Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Users Outside the U.S.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Services are controlled and operated within the United States.
Any information we collect may be transferred to, and processed, stored, and accessed by, us and our service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate.
These jurisdictions may have data privacy laws that may not be as protective as those of your home jurisdiction, and courts and other authorities may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access information about you subject to such data privacy laws.
By using the NPR Services, you agree to this transfer, processing, storage, and access of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
