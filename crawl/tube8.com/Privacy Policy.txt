These Terms of Service apply to the Website, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network "tabs", or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.</p>
<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website.
By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at https://www.tube8.com/info.html#privacy, incorporated herein by reference.
If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.</p>
<p>If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service.
If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form.</p>
<p>When using the Website, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies.
Such rules, guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
We may also offer other websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.</p> Ability to Accept Terms of Service <p>You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Website.
You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.</p> Changes to the Terms of Service <p>We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at https://www.tube8.com/info.html#terms, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
<p>If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the "last modified date".
You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so.
You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms.
If the "last modified" date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged.
On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.</p>
<p>All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter.
The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect.
If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones.
You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission.
By continuing to use the Website subsequent to us making available an amended version of these Terms of Service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.</p> About Our Website <p>The Website allows for uploading, sharing and general viewing of various types of adult-oriented content by registered and unregistered users who desire to share and view visual depictions of adult-oriented content, including sexually explicit images.

</p> TUBE8 - DMCA Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement <p> We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.
We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws.
Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to https://www.tube8.com/ ("<strong>Tube8</strong>"), or all of the foregoing.</p>
<p> If you believe any material accessible on Tube8 infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, "Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement" for instructions on filing such a notice).
These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</p>
<p> If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, "Counter-Notification Procedures" for instructions on filing a counter notification).
It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>
<p> All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English.
Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.</p> Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement <p> If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process.
<strong>Do not make false claims.
Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.</strong>
</p>
<p> You may notify Tube8 of alleged copyright infringement via our form found at https://www.tube8.com/info.html#dmca-form .
This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.</p>
<p>
We also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications.
In that case, in accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the "<strong>DMCA Notice</strong>") must include substantially the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.</li>
<li>Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.
If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it.
General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, is typically not adequate.
Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).</li>
<li>Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
<li>Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf.
To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.</li>
