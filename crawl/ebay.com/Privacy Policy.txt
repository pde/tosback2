<p>By using eBay.com and its related sites, application, services and tools and/or registering for an eBay account, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and in our User Agreement.</p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site.
 All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the site.
Additionally, we will notify you through the eBay Message Center and/or via email of any material changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective on October 10, 2012, for current users, and upon acceptance for new users.
The previous amendment to this Privacy Policy was effective for all users on June 1, 2011.</p> Global Privacy Standards <p>eBay Inc.
has established a set of corporate rules for privacy, known as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which are our global privacy standards for all eBay Inc.
companies.
These BCRs have been approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators.  They are a commitment by eBay Inc.
to protect your personal information and honor our privacy obligations regardless of where your personal information is collected, processed, or stored.
Depending on where you reside, the BCRs may also provide you some additional privacy rights through your local privacy regulator or court.</p>
<p>Some eBay-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies.
The privacy policy that applies will be the policy that is referenced by the respective website, application, service, or tool.
The privacy practices of our corporate family are consistent with those described in this Privacy Policy and our BCRs.
</p>
<p>More information about our BCRs and our global privacy practices and principles, including information on how to contact us with any questions, is available at our eBay Privacy Center.</p>

Information You Share on eBay <p>Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your eBay activity.
Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments.
Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items.
So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.
</p>
<p>If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an Internet café, certain information about you, such as your User ID, activity, or reminders from eBay, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>
Using Information from eBay <p>eBay enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions and collect payments.
We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users.
We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.
To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.
In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>
<p>You agree to use user information only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eBay transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other purposes that a user expressly chooses.</p>

</li>
</ul>No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing <p>We and our users do not tolerate spam.
Make sure to set your eBay communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer.
You are not licensed to add other eBay users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent.
To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails to eBay, please forward the email to spam@ebay.com or spoof@ebay.com.
You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement.

</p>
Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information <p>Your password is the key to your account.
Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters, and do not disclose your eBay password to anyone.
If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify eBay and change your password.</p>
<p>You can see, review, and change most of your personal information by signing on to eBay.
Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely.
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it.
Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.
We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our eBay User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p> How we protect and store personal information <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.
We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.
</p>
<p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the U.S.
and elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located.
We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration.
Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings.
We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations.
In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions permitted by law.</p>
Third Parties <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them.
eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
