<b>Please be advised that this User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see Disclaimer of Warranties.
Limitation of Liability and Legal Disputes provisions below).
It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")).
Unless you opt-out: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</b>
</p> About eBay <p>eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations.
As a marketplace, eBay does not own or sell the items listed on this site, so the actual contract for sale is directly between the sellers and buyers.
eBay is not a traditional auctioneer.
 </p>
<p>While we may provide pricing, shipping, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may choose not to follow it.
Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised.
the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings.
the ability of sellers to sell items.
the ability of buyers to pay for items.

<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>we think that such restrictions will improve the security of the eBay community or reduce our or another eBay user's exposure to financial liabilities</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>we think that you are acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this User Agreement or our policies;</p>

<p>despite our reasonable endeavors, we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us.

We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement and to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.</p> Fees <p>The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Seller fees and invoices page.
We may change our fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions.</p>
<p>You must have a payment method on file when selling on eBay and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date.
If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
(This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 180 days past due, deducting the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.) In addition, you will be subject to late fees.
eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.
If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.</p> Listing Conditions <p>When listing an item, you agree to comply with rules for listing and Selling Practices policy and that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances).
eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for.
Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seller's history, Detailed Seller Ratings, and Feedback.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>number of listings matching the buyer's query.</p>
<p>Accordingly, to drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer.
 </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eBay's Duplicate Listing Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results.</p>
</li>
</ul>Purchase Conditions <p>When buying an item, you agree to the rules for buyers and that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>International Buying and Selling <p>Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers.
We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools.
Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.</p>
<p>You may list your items directly on one or more of eBay's international sites.
Alternatively, we may display your listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale, including those situations where you choose to list an item with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping and the Global Shipping Program).
However, you may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international shipping from your listings and apply an exclusion list to your listings.
If your item is sold to a buyer on an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to that other site's policies and eBay's International Selling Policy.</p>
<p>To assist users who may speak different languages, we may translate listings and other user and/or eBay content, in whole or part, into other languages.
If you are a buyer, we also may provide you with access to tools so you can request an on-demand translation of certain content on our sites, such as parts of a listing or a message from an eBay user.
The accuracy or availability of the translation resulting from such on-demand translation is not guaranteed.</p> Content <p>When providing us with content or posting content using eBay's Services, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademarks, database rights and intellectual property rights you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future.
Further, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you waive your moral rights and promise not to assert such rights against us, our sublicensees or assignees.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that none of the following infringe any intellectual property right: your provision of content to us, your posting of content using the Services, and our use of such content (including of works derived from it) in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>We may offer catalogs of stock images, descriptions and product specifications that are provided by third-parties (including eBay users).
You may use catalog content solely in connection with your eBay listings.</p>
<p>While we try to offer reliable data, we cannot promise that the catalogs will always be accurate and up-to-date, and you agree that you will not hold our catalog providers or us responsible for inaccuracies in the catalogues.
The catalog may include copyrighted, trademarked or other proprietary materials.
You agree not to remove any copyright, proprietary or identification markings included within the catalogs or create any derivative works bases on catalog content (other than by including them in your listings).</p> Notice for Claims of Intellectual Property Violations and Copyright Infringement Pursuant to Section 512(c) of Title 17 of the United States Code <p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as required by the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Learn how to submit a notice to eBay.</p> Holds <p>To protect against the risk of liability, eBay has at times requested, and may continue to request, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, riskiness of the listing category, or the filing of an eBay Buyer Protection case.
This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies.</p> Authorization to Contact You <p>You agree to receive calls, including autodialed and/or pre-recorded message calls, from eBay at any of the telephone numbers (including mobile telephone numbers) that we have collected for you as authorized and described in our Privacy Policy, including telephone numbers you have provided us, or that we have obtained from third parties or collected by our own efforts.
If the telephone number that we have collected is a mobile telephone number, you consent to receive SMS or other text messages at that number.
Standard telephone minute and text charges may apply if we contact you at a mobile number or device.
You agree we may contact you in the manner described above at the telephone numbers we have in our records for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To contact you for reasons relating to your account or your use of our Services (such as to collect a debt, resolve a dispute, or to otherwise enforce our User Agreement) or as authorized by applicable law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contact you for marketing, promotional, or other reasons that you have either previously consented to or that you may be asked to consent to in the future.
If you do not wish to receive such communications, you can opt-out in the communications preference section of your My eBay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share your telephone numbers with our service providers (such as billing or collections companies) who we have contracted with to assist us in pursuing our rights or performing our obligations under the User Agreement, our policies, or any other agreement we may have with you.
These service providers may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded messages calls and/or SMS or other text messages, only as authorized by us to carry out the purposes we have identified above, and not for their own purposes.</p>
<p>We will not share your telephone number with non-affiliated third parties for their purposes without your explicit consent, but may share your telephone numbers with members of the eBay corporate family and/or our affiliates, for their use, as authorized under our Privacy Policy.
Members of the eBay corporate family and/or our affiliates will only contact you using autodialed or prerecorded message calls and/or SMS or other text messages, if you have requested their services.

<b>Returns</b>
</p>
<p>eBay offers a managed returns process to simplify returns for buyers and sellers.
With the eBay returns process, a seller accepting returns can manage and track the return through an automated process on the site.
There is no fee to use the eBay returns process.
If the buyer returns an item because it does not match the listing description, sellers will generally be responsible for return shipping costs.
eBay may automatically apply the eBay returns process to listings where returns are accepted.
Sellers may remove the eBay returns process from their listings by adjusting their account settings within My eBay.
See Using the managed returns process for more details.</p>

<p>
<b>Global Shipping Program</b>
</p>
<p>One of the ways that we may make your eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. The Global Shipping Program is designed to simplify international buying and selling on eBay. For items that are located in the United States and that you sell to an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States.
There, a third party global technology and shipping provider will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item to your buyer. As a seller, there is no fee to join the Global Shipping Program. For items that are purchased by international buyers through the Global Shipping Program, buyers will pre-pay all applicable shipping and import charges during checkout and will benefit from international tracking of the item from the parcel processing facility through delivery.
</p>
<p>
<br>We may choose to make your listings available to international buyers through the Global Shipping Program if you indicate or have indicated your desire to take advantage of this program by accepting this User Agreement in the form of an electronic click-through or if you otherwise opt-in or have opted-in.
If you are not currently opted in to this program and you do not accept the electronic click-through, you will not be able to take advantage of the Global Shipping Program, but you will still be bound by all other provisions of this User Agreement.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>By accepting, you will also be acknowledging that you have read and agree to the Global Shipping Program Seller Terms and Conditions.
Those terms will apply to your participation as a seller in the Global Shipping Program and to all of your eligible new and existing listings following acceptance.
Those terms include, among other important provisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a third party agreement for the processing, customs, and international shipping services, including your consent to the disclosure of certain personal information in connection with those services,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a power of attorney authorizing third parties to act in your place to facilitate the export clearance of items that you sell through the Global Shipping Program,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a description of the items that are ineligible for the program and restrictions on the value, weights, and dimensions of items that may be sold through the program, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies governing the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>Following acceptance, you may later opt out of the program by adjusting your account settings within My eBay.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>eBay Buyer Protection</b>
</p>
<p>Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, eBay Buyer Protection helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues.
Buyers and sellers agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Buyer Protection case.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>If a seller is required to reimburse the buyer or eBay for an eBay Buyer Protection case, the seller authorizes eBay to remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from their PayPal account.
The seller is required to have a valid payment method on file.
If there are insufficient funds in the PayPal account, the seller authorizes eBay to charge any reimbursement amount owed to the payment method on file.
We may also place the reimbursement amount on the seller's invoice.
If seller does not provide eBay with a valid payment method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>We may suspend the eBay Buyer Protection policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>Disclaimer of Warranties.
Limitation of Liability <p>We try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services.
Bid update and other notification functionality in eBay's applications may not occur in real time.
Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eBay's control.</p>
<p>You agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.
Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
<p>In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold eBay responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:</p>

or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your need to modify practices, content, or behavior or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Buyer Protection Policy up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.</p> Release <p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
<b>In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</b>
</p> Indemnity <p>You will indemnify and hold us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach this Agreement, your improper use of eBay's Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.</p> Legal Disputes <p>
<b>You and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the eBay User Agreement your use of or access to eBay's sites, services, applications, and tools, or any products or services sold or purchased through eBay's sites, services, applications, or tools will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</b>
<b>Please read this Section carefully.
It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>A. Applicable Law</b>
</p>
<p>You agree that the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in the User Agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>B.
Agreement to Arbitrate</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to eBay's Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through eBay's Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER EBAY USERS.</b>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures</b>
</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or User Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.
In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of the completed form to us at the following address to initiate arbitration proceedings: eBay, Inc.
c/o National Registered Agents, Inc., 2778 W.
Shady Bend Lane, Lehi, UT 84043. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or eBay, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different eBay users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Costs of Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
