</p>
<p>Alas, post-Sandy New York is not all feel-good tales of entrepreneurial ingenuity and upscale Halal carts.
there’s also been some looting.
Police arrested 15 people in the Far Rockaway section of Queens and nine others in Coney Island, including one woman who was charged with possession of a firearm after police found a gun in the safe she was in the process of stealing.</p>

<strong>3D in 2D: A Supercut</strong>
</p>
<p>When 3D movies play to the technology by flinging things on screen directly at viewers, it looks silly.
Then when those movies are converted to 2D for home viewing, those scenes look downright stupid.
Here is a supercut I put together of some of the most ridiculous examples from some horror movies originally released in 3D (it’s still Halloween, so it’s still relevant).</p>
<p>The films included are: <em>Amityville 3D</em>, <em>My Bloody Valentine 3D</em>, <em>Dogs of Hell</em>, <em>The Final Destination</em>, <em>Final Destination 5</em>, <em>Friday the 13th Part III</em>, <em>House of Wax</em>, <em>Jaws 3D</em>, <em>Night of the Living Dead 3D</em>, <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy’s Dead</em>, <em>Parasite</em>, <em>Piranha 3D</em>, <em>Priest</em>, <em>Saw 3D</em> and <em>Shark Night 3D</em>.</p>
<p>Beware: There are sharks, there is gore, there are flying eyeballs.</p>

</p>
<p>A woman in Hawaii was swimming off the coast of Maui when a 12-foot-tiger shark attacked her.
Despite finding herself in literally the most terrifying situation imaginable, the woman, who has a black belt in tae kwon do, kept cool and preemptively attacked the hellish sea beast with a punch to its nose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s Halloween.
We’re too old to dress up anymore—we’ve essentially been 43 since we were 14—so we thought we’d honor the day with each of us picking the five scenes that scare the living bejeezuses out of us.
With clips, of course.
Put on your headphones and lose your shit along with us.</p>

<li> Oct 31, 2012 6:17pm Tweet <p>Here is Minnesota GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann being loudly and emphatically laughed at after saying she doesn’t participate in “political speech” during a debate against her Democratic opponent, Jim Graves, last night.
Bachmann has time and again very openly supported some of the most right-wing ideas of her party, and some Minnesotans are clearly tired of it.
Though Bachmann still leads in the polls, this election cycle has been harder than 2010’s, when she won the race by 13 points.</p>

<li> Oct 31, 2012 5:40pm Tweet Dear College Kids, If You Dress in an Ironically Racist or Insensitive Costume, You May Get Punched In the Nose Like I Did <p>
</p>
<p>When it actually happened- it being, when I was punched in the face by a black man for wearing what I was wearing for Halloween- is a bit of blur.
The before part anyway.
The after came into focus so sharply and so quickly, it took a while to process.
That is until the blood came gushing out.
The exchange before the guy punched me in the face was simple: he screamed something to the effect of my costume being racist, and I responded with the kind of shitty teen explanation that makes you wonder why doctors don’t devote all of science to discovering a cure for teenager.
Here’s how it went down.</p>

<li> Oct 31, 2012 5:17pm Tweet Lower Manhattan Power Lunch Spot Becomes Sidewalk Kitchen
<p>The power imbalance between upper and lower Manhattan was never going to last forever: two days after closing for the hurricane, SoHo power-lunch spot Balthazar has re-opened.
After a fashion.
Trapped in a powerless Dead Zone, the bistro can’t exactly seat people.
it can, however, dish out food, cooked on a sidewalk grill, to hungry passers-by.
It only looks like a Halal cart, though — according to Twitter chatter, they’ve got lobster and steak sandwiches at a fraction of the price that they’d normally be.
Makes having to walk up to Hell’s Kitchen to charge your phone almost worth it.

<li> Oct 31, 2012 5:13pm Tweet <p>Check out this freaky “Halloween Lobster” caught this week by fisherman Dana Duhaime off the coast of Beverly, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Duhaime, a <em>Simpsons</em> fan, decided to go with the name “Pinchy” for the one-pound female over the obvious Two-Face or Janus.</p>
<p>According to the New England Aquarium, where the colorful crustacean will remain indefinitely, splits can be found in about one out of every 50 to 100 million lobsters, and are believed to occur “during a cellular division when the lobster egg is first fertilized.”</p>
<p>The more you know.</p>
