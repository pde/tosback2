<p> </p> TheStreet Privacy Policy <p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<i>Last revised: February 24, 2012</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TheStreet, Inc.
("TheStreet") shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online.
This is our Privacy Policy regarding the information we collect on TheStreet Portfolio of Websites as such term is defined in the Terms of Use.
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
If changed, we will post an updated Privacy Policy on this page for your review.</p>
<p>Questions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to privacy@thestreet.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Information Gathered and Tracked by TheStreet</p>
<p>We gather two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> PERSONAL INFORMATION <p> </p>
<p>Personal information is provided by users when registering on TheStreet Portfolio of Websites as a member of TheStreet, our free flagship site, or another one of our free websites, when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and voluntarily at certain other points, such as entering contests or completing surveys.
You may enter your information on our site, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information by email at members@thestreet.com, or by telephone at (866) 321-TSCM (8726), between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 6:00 p.m.
ET.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> Registering for Membership on TheStreet <p>Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on TheStreet.com.
However, if you would like to use certain features, such as email newsletters, or access additional products of TheStreet Portfolio of Websites, we require you to register to become a member.</p>
<p>In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password.
You will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registration form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> Subscribing to Premium Services <p>If you would like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you will need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription.
This may include credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on our servers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> Other Personal Information Collection: <p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio Tool - We may provide a free portfolio tool which registered members of TheStreet can use to stay current on stocks in their portfolio.
Participant's portfolio information is kept confidential.</li>
<li>White Papers - We may offer white papers on various investment and financial topics.
In order to download these special reports, you may be required to enter your email address, phone number and/or some additional personal information.</li>
<li>Blogs - We may offer blogs featuring running commentary throughout the trading day by some of our most popular contributors.
These blogs allow subscribers to respond to a blogger's commentary or to another subscriber's post.
Access to some blogs may require a paid subscription to one of our premium services.
We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any positions held in securities they discuss in any comment.
Please note that information submitted to the blogs will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private.</li>
<li>Surveys/Polls - At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reaction to a particular article.
Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally or by third-party partners to better market our services, participation is voluntary.
In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers.
Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.</li>
<li>Contests and Sweepstakes - We may offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners.
If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered or sponsored by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party.
However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> TRACKING INFORMATION <p> </p>
<p>Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to TheStreet Portfolio of Websites.
This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using "cookies."
