</p> FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <p>
<strong>How is Your Content Moderated?</strong>
</p>
<p>On CBC platforms most of Your Content is moderated.
That means that we read it before it is published to make sure it adheres to our Content Submission Guidelines.
We will do our best to get it up promptly.
We may edit Your Content and to ensure that Your Content is posted, we do ask that you follow these Content Submission Guidelines to create a thriving conversation.
We moderate through a variety of moderation techniques including pre-moderation (before publishing), post-moderation (after publishing) and reactive moderation (in response to concerns).</p>
<p>Contributors to CBC.ca start with "Standard" status, meaning they are subject to pre-moderation.</p>
<p>As of April 2010, we added a new status called "Trusted".
Contributors with "Trusted" status by-pass pre-moderation, their submissions are posted immediately.</p>
<p>A contributor becomes a "Trusted" member of the CBC.ca online community by being a frequent contributor with a good reputation (i.e: almost all submissions by the member fall within our Content Submission Guidelines and are suitable for publishing).</p>
<p>
<strong>What if I see content I don’t like?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you think someone else's content violates the Content Submission Guidelines, you have an opportunity to respond by clicking on the "Reporting" link associated with the content and explaining the problem (ie.
Report Abuse).
We’ll investigate.</p>
