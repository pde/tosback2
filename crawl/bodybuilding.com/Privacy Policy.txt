The Bodybuilding.com sites include Bodybuilding.com, BodySpace, TeenBodybuilding.com, Bodybuilders.com, and other Internet sites on which these terms of use are posted.
Bodybuilding.com sites are collectively referred to herein as "Site," Sites," "we," "us" or "our."</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY SITE.
By using any Site or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to these terms, you signify your agreement to these terms of use.
If you do not agree to these terms of use, you may not use the Sites.</p>
<p>Note that special terms apply to some services offered on certain Sites, like rules for particular contests or sweepstakes or other features or activities.
These terms are posted in connection with the applicable service.
Any such terms are in addition to these terms of use, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms of use.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that these terms of use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes your use of the Sites and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Sites, the possibility of our use or display of your Solicited Submissions (as defined below in Section 3, entitled "SUBMISSIONS") and the possibility of the publicity and promotion from our use or display of your Solicited Submissions.</p> 2 Use Of Content <p>All information, materials, functions and other content (including Submissions, as defined in Section 3, entitled "SUBMISSIONS") ("Content") contained on Sites are our copyrighted property or the copyrighted property of our licensors or licensees.
All trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to us and/or our licensors or licensees.
We may change the Sites or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason.</p>
<p>Except as we specifically agree in writing, no Content from any Site may be used, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other than as part of the Site, except that where a Site is configured to enable the download of particular Content, you may download one copy of such Content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial home use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to the Content, and (c) do not use the Content in a manner that suggests an association with any of our products, services or brands.
Any business use, "re-mailing" or high-volume or automated use of any Site is prohibited.</p>
<p>In the event that we offer downloads of software on a Site and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your personal, noncommercial home use only.
We do not transfer title to the Software to you.
You may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form.</p> 3 Submissions <p>In these terms of use, we use the word "Submissions" to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, "Distribute") on or through a Site.</p>
<p>There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions.
"Solicited Submissions" means those Submissions (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity on a Site for our review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or compensation (collectively, "Consideration") (such as prizes or other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions).
and (b) that you Distribute on or through any Site for which you do not seek Consideration (such as in our Forums (as defined below in Section 6, entitled "FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION")).
"Unsolicited Submissions" are any and all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph.</p>
<p>Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through any Sites.
We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
We therefore ask that you not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission.
In any event, you agree that any Submissions you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated Consideration).</p>
<p>Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions.
Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission.</p> 4 Licenses And Representations <p>You hereby grant us and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify (including removing lyrics and music from any Submission or substituting the lyrics and music in any Submission with music and lyrics selected by us), create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on our Sites and third party web sites) for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the "Submissions License").</p>

<p> Most nutritional supplements sold by Bodybuilding.com are manufactured in the U.S., in accordance with applicable U.S.
labor laws.
Some ingredients are sourced from foreign countries but U.S.
manufacturers are required (per Good Manufacturing Practices outlined at 21 C.F.R.
111.260) to test ingredients for purity prior to use in nutritional supplements.
</p>
<p> Bodybuilding.com is committed to conducting business in compliance with applicable law.
We exhibit and promote the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct in our dealings.
Our employees are expected to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, and we recognize the important role manufacturers, ingredient suppliers and business partners play in helping us fulfill our commitment to ethical and responsible retailing.
</p>
<p> Bodybuilding.com is a retailer not a manufacturer, but Bodybuilding.com is not aware of any unethical or illegal labor practices in connection with any ingredient sourced outside the U.S.
We do not audit and assess each product manufacturer's sourcing practice.
We are aware of the importance of ethical sourcing, and if we identify a product manufacturer who does not meet our expectations (including avoiding ingredients manufactured with trafficked labor), we will work with them to take corrective action or discontinue selling products manufactured by them.
</p>

In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.
Except as otherwise provided in this policy, we reasonably endeavor to ensure that we never intentionally disclose any personal identification information about you as an individual user to any third party without having received your permission (through opt-in or similar procedures) except as provided for herein or otherwise as permitted or required under law.
Further, we may contact you based on the information you provide online whether in connection with your registration or in such places as the above described forums.</p>
<p>If you do provide us with personal information for any of these activities, we may use it to conduct the activity.
We may also use cookie technology and Web beacons (discussed in detail below) to improve your experience of these activities, including to remember your preferences, customize the content and advertisements that you see or authenticate your access to your personal information.
In addition, in the event that your personally identifiable information is requested as part of our surveys, polls or promotions, such personally identifiable information may be added to your registration information.</p>
<p>We may also contact you to confirm your registration and communicate about your account status, as well as regarding changes to the Sites' Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you give us your permission, we may also use personal identification information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes.
On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a product or a service that we think might be of interest to the users of our Sites.
For us to obtain your permission to send you this information, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" at the time our request for your personal information is made.
If you do "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at any time, even after you have provided personal information, by following the procedures set forth below at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you initially do not choose to "opt-in," or if you later "opt-out," you may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal identification information is needed.</p>
<p>We have the following exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order.
We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the Sites, or a physical or property threat to you or others.
We may also transfer user information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of related assets or corporate division, or other fundamental corporate change.
We may provide access to your personally identifiable information to our contractors who are performing services for us in connection with our Sites or the services that you have requested.</p>
<p>In addition, on occasion, we may collect personal identification information from you in connection with optional contests, special offers or promotions.
We will share such information with necessary third parties for the purpose of carrying out the contest, special offer or promotion.
Your participation in the contest, special offer or promotion constitutes your consent to such disclosure and use of such information.</p>
<p>Further, the information you enter when making a purchase or an online donation will be shared with payment processors, financial gateways, and your credit card company to authorize credit card payments.
Such information may also be shared with necessary third parties solely for the purpose or carrying out the transactions.</p>
<p>Also, personal information that you submit may be shared with Liberty Media, Inc., our parent company.
Please see the Liberty Media website for more information about Liberty Media's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that if you give out personal information online - for example, on one of our public forums such as a message board or chat room, folder or chat IM feature - that information can be collected and used by third parties.
Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums and have no control over how such third parties may use your information.
You disclose such information at your own risk.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information and password.
You shall be responsible for all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you.
You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your registration or password.</p> Non-Personal Identification Information <p>We collect non-personal identification information through the use of, without limitation, the following types of methodology:</p>
<p>"Cookie" technology: A "cookie" is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.</p>
<p>"IP address tracking": An "IP address" is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are on the Internet.
When you request pages from our Sites, our servers log your IP address.</p>
<p>"Web beacons": A "Web beacon," or "clear gif," is a small graphic image on a webpage or web-based document that a website can use to determine information about a user.</p>
<p>Non-personal identification information might include the browser you use, the type of computer, technical information about your means of connection to our Sites such as the operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.
Our systems may also automatically gather information about the areas you visit and search terms you utilize on our Sites and about the links you may select from within our Sites to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.</p>
<p>We use such information for our business purposes, and, in particular, to administer the Sites, better manage advertising on the Sites, and, in the aggregate, to understand how our users as a group use the services, features and other resources provided on our Sites.
This way we know which areas of our Sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our Sites.</p>
<p>We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we will not share any individual names, personal navigational or other personal information.
For example, we may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Sites.
We may share demographic and preference information with this company to allow them to display appropriate advertisements for you.
</p>
<p>We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on our Sites.
In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Sites.
Some of our advertisers may display ads on our Sites that may use cookie technology or Web beacons to (i) identify non-personal information about our users (such as connection speed, browser and country of origin) and (ii) track user behavior within our Sites.
Advertisers generally use such information to customize the display of ads within our Sites.
We will not permit such advertisers to collect any personal information from our users within our Sites, however, you may choose to voluntarily provide the advertisers with your personal information.
We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.</p>
<p>Further, from time-to-time we contract with a third party web analytics provider to help manage and optimize our Sites.
We use this service to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Sites.
To do this, we use Web beacons and cookie technology on the Sites.
The type of information we collect includes such information as the number of hits a webpage receives, type of browser used, and number of times a visitor makes a purchase from a particular promotion.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which products and services most interest our users, and what kinds of offers our users like to see.
Although this third-party provider logs the information coming from our Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.</p> Special Rules Relating To Children <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age.
Our Sites are not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit our Sites and use our online services.
COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Sites.</p>
<p>When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal information to Bodybuilding.com, we require a parent or legal guardian to:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Register their child by completing the Permission to Participate Form and returning it, by facsimile or postal mail, to us as set forth on the form;</li>
<li>Review our Privacy Policy and verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA.
and</li>
<li>Verify via email confirmation a second authorization that the parent or guardian consents to these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
Send such email authorizations to coppa@bodybuilding.com
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other user.
Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information relating to children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.</p> How Parents Can Access Their Children's Personal Information <p>In compliance with COPPA, a parent or legal guardian may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable information relating to their child or any child in their legal custody who is under 13 years of age.
You may do so by following the instructions below regarding Access to/Correction of Information.
If you request that no further information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use any part of the service or feature that requires a user to "sign in."</p>
