<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br> Rachael Ray Digital LLC (“RRD”) is committed to providing information and activities relating to Rachael Ray on the rachaelray.com website (the “Site”).  Our content includes information about Rachael Ray and her various endeavors, recipes, photos, video and interactivity with our users and also provides links to other Rachael Ray and YUM-O sites.  While we encourage the interactive nature of our website, we strive to promote the online safety and privacy of our users. </p>
<p>We have implemented this Privacy Policy governing the personally identifiable information (“Personal Consumer Information”) collected by this Site.  This Privacy Policy does not govern Personal Consumer Information collected from any other source or in any other manner.
 <br>
<br> Overview<br>
<br> This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to: (i) the type of information that is collected, (ii) how collected information is used and with whom it is shared.
(ii) how we intend to protect the information.
and (iii) how you can access, modify and/or delete such information.  <br>
<br> California Privacy Rights<br> Under California law, California residents who have provided personal information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of personal information that had been so disclosed.  However if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information.  Because the privacy policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by us of your Personal Consumer Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we do not have to provide you with such lists.  If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to <em>
<strong>this address</strong>.
