And this time it’s caught on tape.</p>
<p>Sussex police released dash-cam footage showing a vehicle swerving heavily, hitting road-side shrubbery, and narrowly avoiding roadworks before hitting a parked car.</p>
<p>The driver was uninjured, but police apprehended her and needless to say, she didn’t pass the breathalyzer test.
She was disqualified from driving for 24 months after she plead guilty to two charges — driving above the legal alcohol limit and failing to stop after a road traffic collision.</p>
<p>She was also sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay fines.</p>
