</ol> Privacy at YouTube <p>We work hard to provide transparency and meaningful choice when you use YouTube.
More information about our privacy safeguards is provided below.</p> YouTube Privacy Guidelines <p>Our Privacy Guidelines explain YouTube's privacy process, factors we take into account when processing complaints, and tips on handling privacy complaints for both the complainant and the uploader.</p> Reporting a privacy violation <p>Every day, thousands of people come to YouTube to share videos and engage with one other.
We want you to feel safe when you're on YouTube, which is why we encourage you to let us know if videos or comments on the site violate your privacy or sense of safety.</p>
<p>If a video contains your personal information without consent, including your image, name or national identification number, you can contact us through our Privacy Complaint Process.</p> Private video sharing <p>We created YouTube to make it easy for people to share their videos with the world.
That said, sometimes you may not want everyone to see your video or your channel, and would rather share your work with only a small group of friends or family.
Check out these links to help you do just that:</p>

</ul>YouTube Safety Center <p>In the YouTube Safety Center you'll find information and tips for using YouTube, including ways to manage any abuse on the site as well as resources for educators and parents.
