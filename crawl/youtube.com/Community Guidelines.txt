 <p> Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble.
Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart.
Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelines—just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
</p> Nudity or sexual content <p> YouTube is not for pornography or sexually explicit content.
If this describes your video, even if it's a video of yourself, don't post it on YouTube.
Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.
Learn more </p> Harmful or dangerous content <p> Don't post videos that encourage others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially kids.
Videos showing such harmful or dangerous acts may get age-restricted or removed depending on their severity.
Learn more </p> Hateful content <p> Our products are platforms for free expression.
But we don't support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics.
This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.
Learn more </p> Violent or graphic content <p> It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational, or gratuitous.
If posting graphic content in a news or documentary context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what's going on in the video.
Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.
Learn more </p> Harassment and cyberbullying <p> It’s not ok to post abusive videos and comments on YouTube.
If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed.
In other cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored.
Learn more </p> Spam, misleading metadata, and scams <p> Everyone hates spam.
Don't create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views.
It's not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.
Learn more </p> Threats <p> Things like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously.
Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from YouTube.
Learn more </p> Copyright <p> Respect copyright.
Only upload videos that you made or that you're authorized to use.
This means don't upload videos you didn't make, or use content in your videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations.

Learn more </p> Privacy <p> If someone has posted your personal information or uploaded a video of you without your consent, you can request removal of content based on our Privacy Guidelines.
