<b>Announcing Gratipay 2.0</b>! Thanks for bearing with us as we finish sweeping up after this major upgrade.
As always, feel free to get in touch privately via email or publicly on GitHub with any questions or issues.
Security <ul>
<li>Disclosure</li>
<li>Hall of Fame</li>
</ul>
<p>We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community.
The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.</p> Guidelines <p>We ask that all researchers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;</li>
<li>Perform research only within the scope set out below;</li>
<li>Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us.
and</li>
<li>Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Gratipay until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;</li>
<li>Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission);</li>
<li>Recognize your contribution on our Security Researcher Hall of Fame, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.</li>
</ul>Scope <ul>
<li>https://gratipay.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Source code is available on GitHub.</p> Out of scope <p>Any services hosted by 3rd party providers and services are excluded from scope.</p>

<ul>
<li>Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g.
open doors, tailgating)</li>
<li>Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g.
phishing, vishing)</li>
<li>Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section</li>
<li>UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes</li>
<li>Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities</li>

</ul>How to Report a Security Vulnerability <p>If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please send it to us by emailing security@gratipay.com.
Please include the following details with your report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;</li>
<li>A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us).
and</li>
<li>Your name/handle and a link for recognition in our Hall of Fame.</li>
</ul>
<p>To encrypt your message, you may use our PGP key:</p> $ curl https://gratipay.com/about/security/pgp.asc | gpg --import
gpg: key 7A5F6B30: "Gratipay Security &lt;security@gratipay.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: imported: 1
$ <p>We only use PGP to decrypt messages, never to encrypt messages or authenticate our identity.
Instead, we'll create a private repository on GitHub for ongoing communication about the vulnerability, which we'll invite you to join (see our internal policy document for more details).</p> Feedback <ul>
