<p>Autodesk, Inc.
and its subsidiaries worldwide (collectively “Autodesk,” “we,” or “us”) respect your rights and our obligations in regard to your privacy and personal information. </p>
<p>Autodesk interacts with you in many ways: for example, through our website, desktop software, mobile applications, and our online services.  As you use our products and services to imagine, design and create a better world, you share information with us.  We want you to understand how we use your information, and how you can take steps to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement explains how we collect, store, use, share, transfer, and retain personal information, as well as how you can access and update both your personal information and choices.  We have tried to keep these explanations easy to understand while providing you with enough details to be clear about our practices. </p>
<p>Click on the links in this Privacy Statement to get more information about a word or topic, or you can go to the Key Terms and Additional Information section first.  Thank you for taking the time to learn about our practices, and if you have questions you can contact us through our webform, by e-mail at privacy.questions@autodesk.com, or by postal mail to the address below:</p>

<b>What this Privacy Statement covers<br>
</b>This Privacy Statement is applicable worldwide, and covers how Autodesk treats all personal information collected or received by us through our products, services, Autodesk-owned websites, from third parties, and offline. Certain Autodesk websites, products or services may include supplemental privacy notices or in special cases have their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>Autodesk does not exercise control over third party sites, including those that may offer Autodesk applications, products, and services.
We may offer links to third party sites or provide social media features through our products, services, and websites that allow you to share information with your social networks and to interact with Autodesk on social media platforms. Depending on the feature, your use of these other sites and platforms may enable them to place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. </p>
<p>Autodesk is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Be sure to review the privacy policies, supplemental notices, and settings of all websites or platforms that you visit so you can understand these practices and your options.</p>

<p>
<b>Information Autodesk collects<br>
</b>Autodesk collects both personal information and non-personal information.</p>
<p>“Personal information” is information that personally identifies you and allows us to contact you on- or off-line, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone numbers (including mobile numbers) and fax numbers, and financial information (such as account or credit card number).</p>
<p>"Non-personal information" is aggregated information, demographic information, technical information, and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity and which does not enable us to contact you.</p>
<p>Here are ways in which Autodesk collects information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information you provide to us.  </b>We receive personal and non-personal information from you<b>
</b>when you register for, activate or request a product (including trial products) or service.
create login credentials.
e-mail, call, or send us postal mail, or complete and submit any webform on our website.
interact with us through social media platforms.
submit an error report.
or participate in in-product analytics programs such as the Customer Involvement Program (the “CIP”). Sometimes you may provide us with third party personal information (for example, if you provide someone else’s contact information for follow up on a service request), and we will assume that you have asked for and received the third party’s permission to provide us their information.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Autodesk Online Store and channel partners</b>.
The branded Autodesk Online Store is operated by our ecommerce partner, who is the merchant of record in regard to online sales. This partner’s terms of sale and privacy policy apply when you make online purchases through the Autodesk Online Store. Our ecommerce partner transfers your information to us, and we treat that information as described in this Privacy Statement. Similarly, channel partners such as Autodesk authorized resellers and distributors make our product licenses available for sale. When these channel partners transfer information to us, we treat that information as described in this Privacy Statement.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Supplemental information</b>. From time to time we may supplement personal information you provide to us or that we collect with information from other commercially available sources that we deem credible, such as business contact databases.
For example, this helps us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and keep in our records.  <br>
 </li>
<li>
<b>Automatic data collection tools (including cookies).
</b>When you communicate with us, access Autodesk websites and services through a browser, application, or other client, our servers automatically collect and record certain information. These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by recognizing you when you return and providing you with a customized experience. Autodesk and its service providers may collect environmental variables and use automatic data collection tools such as cookies, embedded web links, and other technologies to collect information. These data collection tools collect standard information from your browser such as browser type, browser language, and the website address you came from when you visited our website.
They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and clickstream behavior (for example, the pages you view and the links you click), along with the date and time of your visit or request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>
<b>Children and privacy<br>
</b>Some Autodesk websites, products, and services are intended for general audiences.
however, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children aged 12 years old and under.
Autodesk encourages parents to spend time online with their children, and we urge parents to teach their children about talking to strangers and not sharing personal information such as real names, addresses, or phone numbers online. In some jurisdictions, notification, prior written permission or other verifiable parental consent may be required of a parent or guardian for children from 13 to 17 years of age. No information should be submitted nor posted to Autodesk websites, products, or services by children 12 years old or under.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>
<b>Storage and security of personal information<br>
</b>We appreciate your trust in Autodesk by sharing your personal information with us, and we are committed to protecting it. We utilize a combination of security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, when we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. Access to personal information is restricted to those employees, contractors, and agents of Autodesk who need to know such data to perform their assigned functions and develop or improve our products and services.  However, despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, we transmit to you or that we store.</p>
<p>You also have an important role to play in securing your personal information. Please do not send us sensitive information through e-mail. Create strong passwords.  Keep passwords secure, change passwords often, and use a secure browser.
Also, remember to sign out of your Autodesk account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.</p>
<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with this Privacy Statement.  Please see the “Contact us” section below.  Note that if you choose to notify us via postal mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>
<b>Autodesk’s use of personal information<br>
</b>As we explained in previous sections, Autodesk collects both personal information and non-personal information. </p>
<p>Our primary purpose for collecting and using personal information is to provide you with an efficient, positive, and personalized user experience. In most cases, the more specific information you provide, the better we are able to personalize your experience with Autodesk.</p>
<p>You agree that we may use your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to process orders and deliver a product or provide a service you have requested.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to conduct credit checks, determine appropriate payment terms and enter into contracts with you.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to contact you, and provide you with order shipping and billing information.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to meet contract obligations.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to provide you with product registration, activation, and technical and customer support.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to allow you to create sign on credentials, personal profiles, and view protected content.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to provide and administer promotions you enter such as a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotional activity.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to allow your participation in activities, such as online discussion groups and communities.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to conduct questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better products and services to our customers and end users.
Your completion of any questionnaire or survey is voluntary.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to support recruitment inquiries.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to send you communications of interest that you have requested, such as e-mails or SMS (text) messages about Autodesk, our products and services, targeted marketing, and promotional offers, all subject to your communication choices. These communications may occasionally include information from other companies about products and services that can add value to Autodesk products and services.  Please see “How to access and update your personal information and choices” below to learn how you can change or withdraw marketing permissions.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to send you operational communications, such as service packs, or product or service notices communicating actions you should take regarding a product or service you have registered and/or purchased.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to allow you to use a “tell a friend,” “forward to a friend,” or similar feature that forwards information you select to another individual, such as a friend or co-worker who you believe is interested in receiving the information.
Autodesk does not store the personal information that you submit about the third party when using these features.
We use the e-mail address and contact name (if applicable) for the sole purpose of sending a one-time e-mail on your behalf.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to customize, measure and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to personalize your overall experience with Autodesk, our websites, products, and services.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to ensure the use of our products and services is licensed and in compliance with applicable law.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>to undertake any of the activities described in the “Sharing of personal information” section below, including transfer within Autodesk companies and to Authorized Third Parties as described below.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>for any related purpose that you would reasonably expect, such as general administrative functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end result is non-personal information -- for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who live in a particular country or to get a better understanding of our subscriber base by analyzing on an aggregate basis our users' demographics, interests, and behavior.  Because the result does not identify you or any other user specifically, this is non-personal information and we may use it for any purpose, including sharing it with third parties. </p>
<p>Sometimes we combine personal information with non-personal information.  Examples include combining your name with your geographic location (Europe) or your e-mail with your industry (media and entertainment).  When we combine personal information with non-personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined and used together.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>
<b>Sharing of personal information<br>
</b>We may share your personal information within Autodesk or any of our subsidiary companies worldwide for purposes of data processing or storage and to guide decisions about their products, services, and communications. Autodesk, Inc.
is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used personal information.</p>
<p>Unless Autodesk has your permission to do so, we do not rent, sell, share, or trade your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>By submitting your personal information to us, you agree that your personal information may be shared with and transferred to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Authorized Third Parties.

Examples include fulfilling orders, sending communications, removing repetitive personal information from customer lists, ensuring accuracy of personal information, analyzing data and providing related services, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments.

<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Channel partners and other business partners.</b> As noted above, we work with other companies, such as channel partners (including distributors and resellers), who sell our product licenses and services. If you submit personal information to Autodesk in order to evaluate, request information about purchasing, and/or to purchase a product or service that is offered by a channel partner or another company with whom we have a relationship, we may share your personal information with that company so the company can process your request (for example, order to ship, supply, maintain, renew or service the products or services that you requested) and you may be contacted by the company.
We may combine non-personal information with the personal information shared in order to help personalize your experience. We require any such company to agree to implement reasonable safeguards to protect the personal information, and to use the personal information only for the purposes for which it was provided. AUTODESK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU BY SUCH COMPANIES.<br>

or as otherwise required by law (including laws outside your country of residence).<br>
<br>

<li>
<b>Merger, bankruptcy and other transactions.  </b>If Autodesk should merge with another company, file for bankruptcy, or if Autodesk should decide to sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, we may disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers.
We may also share personal information about you with our consultants and advisors (such as accountants and lawyers) in connection with such transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU OPENLY DISCLOSE THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES.
If you post or provide comments, for example in a discussion forum, blog, or community area on an Autodesk website, please remember that the personal and other information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected, or used by other users, potentially inside or outside Autodesk.  We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal information about you, or any other information, in such areas.</p>
<p>Each participant’s comments are his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Autodesk. From time to time we post customer testimonials, comments, and reviews which may contain personal information including name, title, and photograph.
We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting personal information with their testimonial.</p>

<p>
<b>Retention and deletion of personal information<br>
</b>We will retain personal information about you only as long as we need it to honor your choices, fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, or as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations. For example, certain laws and regulations may require us to retain certain transactional data. We take reasonable measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For example, when the information is printed on paper, we take reasonable measures to delete or destroy it by shredding or incineration.
where the information is stored electronically, we use technical means to render the information unusable.</p>

<b>The CER tool.</b> The CER dialog box appears whenever the Autodesk product you are using closes unexpectedly.
If you choose to send an error report to Autodesk, the report is sent to Autodesk in encrypted form.
When Autodesk receives the error report, automated systems sort the reports so that Autodesk developers can review and analyze the data.
Once a software error is believed to be fixed, it is included in either a future maintenance update or the next release of the product.
Autodesk may also notify those customers who initially reported the error, if they included their e-mail address in the customer error report.</p>
<p>CER collects and sends the following information as part of the error reporting process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system name and version</li>
<li>Autodesk product name, version, and serial number</li>
<li>Graphics configuration driver name and version</li>
<li>List of Autodesk applications loaded when an error occurs</li>
<li>List of recent Autodesk commands</li>
<li>Portion of Autodesk program in memory when an error occurs  <br>
<ul>
<li>If personal information or confidential information is in the system memory when the software error occurs, it may be sent to Autodesk with the error report through the CER feature.
If you have concerns about information being sent to Autodesk through CER, do not send the error report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above information, you may choose to include the following optional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail address</li>
<li>Step-by-step description of the error</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Other error reporting tools.</b> From time to time Autodesk offers product specific error reporting tools.  A dialog box will appear, and you will be told what information the tool will collect, how it will be sent to Autodesk, and any other relevant information about the tool or its use.</p>

<b>The Customer Involvement Program<br>
</b>The Autodesk Customer Involvement Program (the “CIP”) provides Autodesk with a method for gathering and analyzing data on how Autodesk customers use our products.
By participating in the program, you add valuable input that helps us understand how to best improve your overall experience with Autodesk and our software.</p>
<p>If a customer chooses to participate in the CIP, the CIP client automatically collects information about the customer’s use of product features, system configuration, and software errors.
About once a day, a small file containing this CIP information is sent in encrypted form to Autodesk’s CIP servers.</p>
<p>The following types of information may be collected from all CIP participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system name and version</li>
<li>System configuration information, such as processor, memory, and graphics card</li>
<li>Autodesk product commands and operations used</li>
<li>Name, serial number, and version of Autodesk products</li>
<li>Error conditions</li>
<li>Format and source of data imported or exported from Autodesk products</li>
<li>IP address </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the information listed above, the CIP may allow a participant to submit contact information (such as the participant’s e-mail address and company name).
Contact information is required if a participant seeks to participate in beta (pre-release) programs, and if the participant is willing to receive communication from Autodesk developers and product managers.</p>

<b>Automatic data collection tools<br>
</b>As is common with websites, Autodesk and our service providers may use “cookies,” "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or other similar technologies in connection with website pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of website users and e-mail recipients, determine the success of marketing campaigns, compile aggregate statistics about website usage and response rates and make it easier for you to navigate our website or better personalize your experience with us, for example by not requiring you to submit login credentials repeatedly or by showing you content targeted to your interests. </p>
<p>A “cookie” is a commonly used automated data collection tool.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a browser from a web server and gets saved on the hard drive of the computer that you are using.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.
If you choose to reject all cookies, however, you will be unable to use those Autodesk services that require registration or customization in order to participate.
If you choose to accept cookies from us and our service providers, you are granting us and our service providers your consent to set cookies on your computer.

<b>Internet Protocol (IP) address<br>
</b>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Depending on your service provider, your IP address may be “variable,” which means you are assigned a different IP address each time you connect to the Internet.  IP addresses are assigned to countries in blocks, so even if your IP address is variable we can determine the country with which your IP address is associated.</p>
