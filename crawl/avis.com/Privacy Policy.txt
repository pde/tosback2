<b>AVIS APP DISPUTES - DEFINITIONS</b>
</p>

<p>All other disputes are Non-Avis App Disputes.
Any claim arising from your purchase of an Avis product or service, including renting a car, is a Non-Avis App Dispute.
Any claim arising from the content of any offer or advertisement on the Avis App is a Non-Avis App Dispute.</p>
<p>
<b>AVIS APP DISPUTES – PRE-DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>
</p>
<p>Before filing a lawsuit in connection with any Avis App Dispute (including, but not limited to, in an individual arbitration or in a small claims proceeding), you and Avis agree that we shall give the other party written notice of the claim to be asserted 30 days before initiating a proceeding and make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve the claim.
If you are intending to assert a claim against Avis, you must send the written notice of the claim to Attention: Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, 6 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054 Attn: Legal Department.
If Avis is intending to assert a claim against you, we will send the written notice of the claim to you at your address appearing in our records.
NO SETTLEMENT DEMAND OR SETTLEMENT OFFER USED IN THIS PREDISPUTE RESO- LUTION PROCESS MAY BE USED IN ANY PROCEEDING, INCLUDING AS EVIDENCE OR AS AN ADMISSION OF ANY LIABILITY OR DAMAGES (OR LACK THEREOF).</p>
<p>
<b>AVIS APP DISPUTE RESOLUTION -- VENUE</b>
</p>
<p>You agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of New Jersey for any Avis App Dispute.
You agree that any Avis App Dispute will be resolved in New Jersey to the exclusion of any other potential venue.</p>
<p>
<b>AVIS APP DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION, JURYTRIAL WAIVER</b>
</p>
<p>(Not applicable if mandatory arbitration is prohibited by consumer protection legislation, such as in Quebec.) Neither you nor we will be able to sue in court in connection with an Avis App Dispute.
All Avis App Disputes must be resolved through individual (non-class) arbitration.
You indicate your acceptance to these Terms, including this agreement to arbitrate, by continuing to use the Avis App.</p>
<p>You and Avis intend for this to be an agreement for arbitration that can be enforced under both the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A.
§§ 1–16, and the New Jersey Arbitration Act (NJAA), N.J.S.A.
2A:23B–1 to –32.</p>
<p>You and Avis waive any rights to maintain other available resolution processes for Avis App Disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes.
You and Avis waive any right to a jury trial for Avis App Disputes.
Instead of suing in court, we each agree to settle Avis App Disputes only by arbitration.
The rules in arbitration are different.
There’s no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the agreement as a court would.</p>
<p>Any Avis App Dispute shall be determined by arbitration in New Jersey before one arbitrator(s).
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration.
Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
If for any reason, JAMS cannot or will not provide this arbitration, the parties may ask any court of competent jurisdiction to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the parties.</p>
<p> To the extent a party commences any action with includes both Avis App Disputes and Non-Avis App Disputes, consideration of the Non-Avis App Disputes shall be stayed until the Avis App Disputes are fully arbitrated.
Then, any Avis App Disputes will be considered by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If you are an individual (instead of, for instance, a partnership, corporation, or other form of entity or non-natural person), in the event that (1) your claim is less than $10,000, and (2) you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Avis will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.</p>
<p>
<b>AVIS APP DISPUTE RESOLUTION - NO CLASS ACTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>(<u>Not applicable if class action waivers are prohibited by consumer protection legislation</u>.) You agree that you will not file a class action against Avis or its Providers, or participate in a class action against Avis or its Providers in any Avis App Dispute.
You agree that you will not file or seek a class arbitration, or participate in a class arbitration against Avis or its Providers, in any Avis App Dispute.</p>
<p>
<b>SEVERANCE OF INVALID TERMS</b>
</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the class action waiver of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the agreement of the parties to engage in arbitration shall likewise be deemed stricken.</p>
<p>
<b>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</b>
</p>
<p>The provisions and conditions of these Terms, and each obligation referenced herein, represent the entire Agreement between Avis with respect to your use of this free Avis App, its affiliated or related entities, and you, and supersede any prior agreements or understandings not incorporated herein.
In the event that any inconsistencies exist between these Terms and any future published terms of use or understanding, the last published Terms or terms of use or understanding shall prevail.</p>
