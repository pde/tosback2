<br> A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS: <p>Mattel adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.
in our websites, online services and apps directed to children under 13.
Wherever we refer to “children” or a “child” in this Privacy Statement we mean children under 13.
Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information (like their full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number, etc.) without your permission.</p>
<br> A SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS: <p>If you are under 13, you should get your parent's or legal guardian's permission before giving out your contact information, like e-mail address or phone number, or any other personal information, to Mattel or to anyone else.</p>
<br> 1.
What Are Mattel’s Children’s Privacy Practices? <p>At our websites, online services or apps directed to children under 13, we do not collect personal contact information (like full name, e-mail address, phone number or home address) without consent of a parent or legal guardian except in special, limited circumstances described below.
We do not ask for more information than is necessary for a child to participate in the activity.
We take steps to prevent children from posting or publicly disclosing personal contact information, like name, phone number or e-mail address, online, without parental consent.</p>
<br> a.
What Information Does Mattel Collect from Children Under 13 and How Is It Used? <p>To participate in special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, games or clubs, we might ask your child to "register." They can often do so anonymously by just providing a first name or user name, and password.
When we ask for your child's first name, we encourage them to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only they know.
Sometimes we will ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the Site.
We use technology, like cookies, to recognize visitors by their anonymous user name when they revisit our Site and to screen for age in accordance with COPPA.
We may also use technology for similar purposes in our Apps.</p>
<p>We may sometimes need a child’s e-mail address and/or your e-mail address.
We may ask a child for your e-mail address so we can notify you of your child’s interest in our Site.
If we need more than just your child's first name (or screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular online activity or App, we will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so that we can notify you of your child's request and get your permission.
When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information you or your child provides us, and how you can review your child's information and ask us to delete the information.
With your verifiable consent, we may collect other personal information from your child such as a last name or home address when the information is necessary for a particular activity.</p>
<p>We don't keep your (or your child's) e-mail address unless you tell us it is okay.
If social networking opportunities are available at our children’s websites, they are structured so that no personal information is shared between visitors or verifiable parental consent is obtained.</p>
<p>Mattel might collect an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) from your child under 13 without your consent, but only in the following special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a child sends a request to us, we keep their e-mail address for long enough to respond to them.
Mattel deletes this information from our system after we answer their question.
In the case of “send a friend” e-mails, we do not ask for your child’s e-mail address and only use the friends’ e-mail address to send the message.</li>
<li>If a child signs up for an e-mail newsletter or other activity that requires multiple online contacts with the child, we also ask the child for a parent's or legal guardian's e-mail address so we can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out.</li>
<li>Occasionally, Mattel has special activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or contests, that are open to children.
We ask your child to give us your e-mail address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service.
If we need more than an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) to enter your child in the promotion, award a prize, or offer the service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and why, and generally ask that you (not your child) provide it.
For instance, we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins, or for your phone number so that we can tell you when your child has won.
Any information you or your child give us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may offer enhanced services which require a parent to register and establish the appropriate permission level for the child.
Content and activities available may vary depending on the subscription and Site.
Parents will be provided with information on the type of content and activities their child may access at the time they subscribe and are always in charge of their child's account.
Subscription fees may apply for some services.</p>
<p>We may ask for certain non-personal information that helps us understand our visitors, like city and state, birthdate, gender, hobbies, etc.</p>
<p>We also use technology to facilitate the ability to play games, to recognize returning visitors, for research, and for other purposes, including to screen under-age visitors from certain features or areas intended for older visitors, and collect certain information automatically.
Read more We require our advertising service partners to comply with self-regulatory guidelines on targeted advertising.
Mattel does not permit interest-based advertising on Sites directed to children under 13 or where we have actual knowledge that a child is under 13.

<br> b.
Can My Child Access the Web Through Your Sites or Apps? <p>Your child can navigate to the Internet through most of our Sites, services and Apps.
Apps must typically be downloaded from an app store.
Your computer or mobile device may enable you to restrict the ability of your child to visit other areas and to make purchases online or through Apps.</p>
<p>App stores generally require the adult mobile device owner to register to download or make purchases.
Some Apps may offer options to visit an online store to make a product purchase.</p>
<p>We encourage you to spend time with your children when they are online or using any mobile device so you understand the Sites, activities and Apps they are engaged in, and to adopt available device and browser controls that reflect your preferences about your child’s ability to access the Internet or make purchases online.</p>
<br> c.
Can I Access, Update and Review Information You Have About My Child? <p>If you no longer wish your child to participate in an e-mail newsletter, simply click on the link that is provided for removal or contact us at Service@mattel.com for Mattel or Fisher-Price, or Service@americangirl.com for American Girl.
Upon proper identification, parents or legal guardians may review the personal information we have collected about their child, update their child’s contact details, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information.
Click here to print a copy of our Children’s Personal Information Access Request, fill it out completely and mail it to the address indicated on the form.</p>
<p>However, if you ask us to delete your child's information, your child may not be able to participate in online or app activities.</p>
<br> 2.
What Are Mattel’s Privacy Practices for Consumers 13 Or Older? <p>You do not have to share any personal information (like full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number, etc.) to view our websites or Apps, but most of our Sites for adults, like our collector and e-commerce Sites, contain special sections and privileges for members who register.
(App stores are run by third parties and may require that you register to download or purchase an App.) We may also collect information from you offline, such as when you order a catalogue, participate in a sweepstakes or contest, or make a purchase at one of our stores.

<p>We also use technology to collect certain information automatically, like your IP address or unique device identifier (“UDID”), international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), mobile equipment identifier (“MEID”) or media access control “MAC”) address.

The personal information we ask for is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number and an e-mail address.
We may offer you the ability to receive information via SMS or MMS.
by providing your mobile phone or similar number you are agreeing to receive information on your mobile device.

Customers must be over the age of 18 with a valid credit card to purchase.
In addition, only a parent or guardian can register children under age 13 to participate in enhanced subscription services or certain community features at our websites.
Some Sites allow visitors to create a Wish List.
</p>
<p>When a customer puts an item in a shopping cart, places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information associated with the transaction, including the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping address, and credit card information, as well as ship-to information if products are intended for a third party.
Customers have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their online order.

For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the Web.
Certain Internet Service Providers may assign the same IP address to many users.
The IP address allows us to count the total number of "hits" on our sites.
Your IP address and cookies are not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information, like a name or email address, unless you register or order at our online stores.
however, if you register at our online stores, all information we collect will be associated with your customer file.</p>

Check your browser's Help menu or your built-in mobile device settings to find out how.
Some mobile devices store cookies not only in areas connected to the browser, but also in areas that are app-specific so these cookies cannot be controlled by the browser settings.

We do not control web beacons in third party ads.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Apps</strong>
</i>
<br> When downloading an App (or using an App that relies on online features made available through your mobile platform), the app store will collect certain device and app-related information.

These features might enable you to engage in activities like find a nearby store with one of our products or play certain games, for example.
You can generally limit or prohibit the collection of location information by using the built-in settings on your mobile device.
You will typically be notified if the App or service collects location information and given a chance to agree.
We do not permit collection of precise location information (actual address) in mobile Apps without your consent.
Child-directed Apps do not collect precise location information.</p>
<p>
<i>
<strong>Website and Mobile App Analytics</strong>
</i>
<br> We or our agents and service partners may use cookies and web beacons to analyze the effectiveness of our Sites, services and Apps.

We require these providers to commit to maintaining the anonymity of this information.
You may be able to opt out of data collection or use by some third party analytics companies who work with us.
Contact us if you would like information on our third party analytics service providers.</p>

</i>
<br> Mattel may work with third party online or mobile network advertisers who use cookies, pixels, or transparent GIF files to help us manage advertising at our Sites or Apps intended for adults, and measure its effectiveness.

These GIF files enable these third party network advertisers to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser or mobile device.
This in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our third party network advertisers.
The information that we collect and share in this fashion is de-identified and not personally identifiable.

<br> We support the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
As part of this service, our online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.
For more information about our network advertisers, including information about how to opt out of technologies that they control, please follow the directions on the AdChoices icon within any behavior based advertisement.
You can also visit websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance to access opt-out tools available from those participating in the program.
Participating network advertisers will be listed at those sites.
Opting out means that you will still see ads, but they may not be tailored to your specific interests.<br>
<br>
<strong>Please note:</strong> your opt-out choices are browser-specific and device-specific.
