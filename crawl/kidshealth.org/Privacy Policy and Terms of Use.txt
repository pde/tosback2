<p>KidsHealth will make reasonable efforts to comply with Your wishes.</p> Contact Us <p>The Contact Us page is the primary means of communication with KidsHealth staff for a website visitor.
Website visitors may use the Contact Us page to send content suggestions or questions about the Parents, Kids, or Teens areas of the site directly to the Parents, Kids, or Teens editorial staff.
Website visitors may also use this form to ask general questions about the website or content, submit notification of broken links, communicate privacy concerns, and/or submit praise and/or complaints.
All comments are seen by the Editor-in-Chief of KidsHealth who, along with senior editorial staff, handle all content-related issues and will use these comments, for instance, as ideas for generating new content or answering a question in a Q&amp;A section on the site.
All technical and operational issues are forwarded to the Director of Operations for handling.
As KidsHealth policy is not to respond to visitor email, the Contact Us page does not ask for any personally identifiable information (such as an email address), and the only way personally identifiable information would be collected is if the visitor were to voluntarily type such information into one of the open text fields.
The Contact Us page is secured using 128-bit encryption.
Any health information submitted through the Contact Us page is not stored in a way that is personally identifiable.
We may, unless you indicate otherwise, store, edit, and excerpt your email for use in Q&amp;As, presentations, analyses, and other similar purposes.
In these cases, we will delete any content that would specifically identify you as the writer of the email.</p> Newsletters <p>The only personally identifiable information that is actively collected by KidsHealth are email addresses of individuals who opt-in to our newsletter programs.
These email addresses are only used for delivering our newsletters.
These addresses are not typically viewed by a human being unless there is some problem with the database.
Users may remove their email address from our list by using the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of each newsletter.</p> A Note to Parents <p>Our Kids section is intended to be a safe resource for children under 13 to find useful, age-appropriate information.
Although The Nemours Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable foundation and as such is not subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, it takes children's privacy very seriously.
The Nemours Foundation and KidsHealth do not sell the information sent to it, whether by children or anyone else.
In addition to collecting information about your use of our website (see "Privacy"), KidsHealth also collects personally identifiable information through services offered on our site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email newsletters, administered through ExactTarget, which are opt-in, and contain links to content on the site.</li>
<li>Quick Polls, administered through Polldaddy, which are opt-in polls inviting readers to submit their opinion.</li>
<li>Surveys, administered through SurveyMonkey, which are opt-in surveys inviting readers to submit their opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Contact Us page does not ask for any personally identifiable information.
Sometimes, children write KidsHealth with a personal medical question.
As stated elsewhere, KidsHealth generally does not answer such questions and does not collect email addresses on the Contact Us form in order to be able to respond.
However, there are times when a visitor includes an email address and a physician believes it is advisable to ask a follow-up question or offer a comment.
for instance, in the case of a life-threatening condition.
Only in these rare and serious instances will KidsHealth respond to an individual communication or take action on the information.</p> Security <p>KidsHealth employs reasonable security measures to protect the personal information You submit to it.
Such security involves the use of SSL-secured Web forms, firewalls, and other commonly employed security methods.</p> User Submissions <p>KidsHealth welcomes Your comments on its site and content.

<p>The editorial staff makes every effort to be as neutral as possible with regard to gender, race, color, religion, and age.

If You decide to visit any third-party sites using links from this site, You do so at Your own risk.</p> Emails Claiming to Be From KidsHealth <p>Occasionally, in a scam known as "phishing," mass emailers will send messages that claim to be from KidsHealth.
They may use our name, logo, or employee email addresses in fraudulent emails trying to obtain valuable information from consumers and businesses.
These con artists know that people trust KidsHealth.
That's why they may use our name or that of some other well-known organization to trick people into believing that they are dealing with a legitimate request for personal information.
These fraudulent emails often create a false sense of urgency intended to prompt the recipient to take action.</p>
<p>KidsHealth does not send out unsolicited emails or commercial endorsements, and does not ask for detailed personal information.
If you get this sort of email appearing to be from KidsHealth, you should assume that it is fraudulent and avoid clicking any link within the email.</p> Disclaimer of Warranties <p>KidsHealth does not warrant that the site will operate error-free or that the site or its server are free of computer viruses or other harmful material.
