 Your California Privacy Disclosures Do Not Track<p>Apple does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
If you are visiting such sites, Safari allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
If you would like to learn how to set Safari so that websites do not track you, go here:  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21416. </p>

Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.<br>  </p>Notice for Minors<p>Apple offers interactive services which allow you to post content to share publicly or with friends.
