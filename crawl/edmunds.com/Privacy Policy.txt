In addition, if the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service you use is "co-branded" (<em>i.e.</em>, the page or screen on which it appears displays the name of both Edmunds and one of our partners), your PII may be shared with that partner.
Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies or other entities, distributors, agents, contractors or partners use your PII.</p>
<p>If you use the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services to call, email, text or chat with a dealer, or if we otherwise act as an intermediary through which communications between a dealer and you are transmitted, a recording of your conversation, or the email, text or chat communications, between you and that dealer (as well as the phone number or email address from which you make such call or initiate such email, text or chat communications), will be made available both to us and that dealer (unless we choose to shield your email address or certain other information from that dealer), as well as any company requested by us or the dealer to facilitate those communications (including any social media website or application from which you initiate a communication).

<p>Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online services.</p>
<p>In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable Web site usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other Web sites and online services.

These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across Web sites and online services.</p>
<p>Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one.
