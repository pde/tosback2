Petition and Public Comment signers are required to provide certain personal information such as name, email address and often street address.
This information is required to validate the petition signature / public comment.
Care2 uses cookies and a signature database to provide data integrity and ease of use.</p>
<p>For pages you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, country and comments as public information.
For example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the President and legislators, other targets, or to the press.
Unless you have requested to be included as "anonymous," this information will also be visible on the website.
We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to members of Congress, to other public officials, or to other targets as part of a petition to validate your signature.
We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city, state and country, available to the press and public online.</p>
<p>For some petitions we provide an advocacy service allowing individuals to send individual e-mails to public officials, legislators, and other targets as well as public comments to government agencies, through our website.
These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and contact information is provided as part of the submission.
These messages will only be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis by signing an action.
You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our email tool.
Optional comments will be included in the body of the email message delivered to the petition target.</p>
<p>During the signing process, you may opt to receive certain newsletters and memberships, in which case Care2 will send your contact information, including email address, street address, and sometimes phone, to those third-party providers.
However, unless you specifically opt to receive such offers or send your contact information to third parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email address information confidential.
Note that for many campaigns, the default settings assume that you want to receive communications from the petition sponsor.
If you do not wish to receive such communications, please uncheck the box next to the signup offer.
Please note that when you join a third party we may use your petition activity to personalize the actions you see on the site and that we send to you by email.</p>
<p>Newsletters:</p>
<p>Care2 offers a variety of newsletters.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each newsletter, or by going to your My Subscriptions page to change your subscription preferences.</p>

<b>Facebook Connect:</b>
</p>
<p>You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect.
These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.
Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
<p>Links to 3rd<b> Party Sites:</b>
</p>
<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Care2.com.
If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.
We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.</p>
<p>
<i>Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?</i>
</p>
<p>Care2 will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
Please see the section above about ThePetitionsite to learn how your petition signature information is shared.
In certain situations, Care2 may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or to protect the rights or property of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized Care2 member services.
If Care2 is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Care2 may also disclose your personal information, including name and contact information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter.
We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements.
These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners.
However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information or use for any other purposes other than to provide these services to us.
If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us through our Help Request Form.
Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with third-party data.
Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, <i>X% of our users are female</i>) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>
<i>How do I change or delete my personal information?</i>
</p>
<p>Upon request, Care2 will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.
To make changes to your name, password, address, subscriptions and other account information, simply visit the My Settings page.
Select the appropriate function(s) there to make your desired change(s).
For other changes, or to request deletion of your information, please contact us using our Help Request Form.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>
<i>Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?</i>
</p>
<p>Care2 offers a variety of direct e-mail subscriptions describing our petition success stories, new site features, healthy living tips, activist alerts, and announcements, including commercial and non-commercial offers.
If you do not want to receive any of our optional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a member or during other subscription opportunities.</p>
<p>If you sign a petition on ThePetitionSite.com, you will automatically receive emailed news updates about the petition and other important causes.</p>
<p>If you elect to receive any of our newsletters but later change your mind, go to your My Settings page.
from there you can edit both your "Subscriptions" and your "Notifications." Our emailed newsletters and notifications contain an "unsubscribe" link to allow you to easily remove your address from that mail stream.</p>
<p>Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional emailed messages, such as critical service announcements or other correspondence, to all registered members.
To stop all such announcements, you must delete your account.
You may do so by following this link.</p>
<p>Care2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and from commercial entities.
If you elect to receive any of these newsletters, some personal information, including your name and email address, will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the newsletter.
In these cases, Care2 would no longer be able to track and control the user information.
The user would be able to contact the newsletter publishers in order to control subscription preferences.</p>
<p>
<i>Does Care2 use Tracking Technologies?</i>
</p>
<p>Yes, cookies and other tracking technologies are used on Care2 in several ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>As is true of most web sites, Care2.com gathers certain information automatically.
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We do link this automatically collected data to other information collected about site visitors.</li>
<li>Care2 and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

</ul>
<p>
<i>Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?</i>
</p>
<p>We would only provide user email addresses to nonprofit or advertising partners with the user's direct permission.
We respect your privacy and despise spam.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner newsletters or other commercial offers.
When you opt to receive such an offer via Care2, we will send your email address and other necessary contact information to the newsletter publisher.
Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer.
Care2 will never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.</p>
<p>Why then do some people receive spam at an account they have only used on Care2? In many cases, spammers create a "dictionary attack" by combining common names and initials to create a list of email addresses that might or might not work.
In many cases, Care2 members send email from a Care2 account's email address to a friend or family member whose computer gets a virus or whose email account is hacked, resulting in private email addresses being revealed to the spammer.
In other cases, two people have similar addresses, perhaps differing by only 1-2 characters, and one user makes a typographic mistake that results in the other user's address.
The bottom line is that if you receive spam, we had nothing to do with it.
We despise spam, and we would never associate ourselves with spammers.</p>
<p>With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message sent to us and do our best to respond quickly.
We do save messages that might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do not sell, rent, give, or share e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<i>How does Care2 secure your information and its data storage?</i>
</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Care2′s servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in California, USA.
The facility has some of the most powerful physical security systems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression systems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms.
Only qualified Care2 engineers are given access to the building.</p>
<p>Access to the database is restricted.
All servers are protected by a firewall and secure data lines.
Server access is restricted to qualified Care2 employees, on an as-needed basis to maintain the operation of the website.</p>
<p>Although we maintain strict policies and procedures to safeguard our servers and our customers' data, it is not possible to guarantee security due to the inherent risks of transmitting data over the Internet.</p>
<p>
<i>What is Care2′s data retention policy?</i>
</p>
<p>We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>
<b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b>
</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p>
<p>
<i>What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?</i>
</p>
<p>Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy, but will notify users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the site.
In the event of any material change, this notification will be prior to that change becoming effective.
If the change involves the use of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.</p>
