<strong>Changes to the AUP</strong>
<br>The Internet is still evolving, and the ways in which the Internet may be abused are also still evolving.
Therefore, we may from time to time amend this AUP to further detail or describe reasonable restrictions on your use of our Services by publishing a revised version of the AUP at http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/aup, or in the event of a material adverse change to the AUP, by providing you thirty (30) days written notice.
 </p>
<p>The revised AUP will become effective as to you on the first to occur of:  (i) your execution of a new or additional agreement for all or part of your Hosted System that incorporates the revised AUP by reference, (ii) the first day of a renewal term for an Agreement that begins at least thirty (30) days after the time that the revised AUP has been posted, or (iii) thirty (30) days following our written notice to you of a material change to the AUP.</p>
<p>If your compliance with the revised AUP would adversely affect your use of the Hosting Services, you may elect to terminate the Agreement by giving Rackspace written notice of your objection no later than thirty (30) days following the date that the revised AUP would otherwise have become effective as to you.
  We will not charge you an early termination fee for a termination on these grounds.
  If you elect to terminate, you may continue using the Services for up to an additional ninety (90) days and we will not enforce the revision as to you during this time, you will continue to be subject to the prior version.  If you choose to terminate your Services under this Subsection, we may decide to waive that change as to you and keep your Agreement in place for the remainder of the term.</p>

</p>
<p>
