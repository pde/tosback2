</p> Submission Rules General Guidelines <p>You want to upload some videos? We love that! After all, uploading short flicks to Web Site is one of the five greatest things you can do in the world.
First, there are some rules to follow.
We know, you hate rules, but they exist to keep Web Site from devolving into chaos and becoming another business horror story.
So here you go (take notes, we'll be testing you later): </p>
<ul>
<li> No cloning allowed.
No, we're not talking about producing identical sheep in the lab - that's cool.
We're talking about duplicating videos that already exist on the site.
We HATE duplicates, because repetition repetition sucks sucks.
So before you upload a video to Web Site, please conduct a search to see if it already exists here.
</li>
<li> Ten is enough.
No, we're not talking about that cheesy TV show from the Seventies.
We're talking about the length of your video: keep it under 10 minutes.
Anything longer than that will be removed automatically by our system.
</li>
<li> Keep your pants on.
We're not prudes here, but we want Web Site to serve as wide a community as possible.
This means we will not allow sexually explicit videos on the site.
Those are simply 2H4M (Too Hot For Metacafe).
<ul>
<li> What about partial nudity or implied sexuality? We're not afraid of the odd 'wardrobe malfunction' but it's better to practice safe sex and put an 18+ filter on it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Filter that violence.
Please remember that Web Site is all about entertainment and entertainment should not come at the expense of others.
So if your video contains violence, please stick the appropriate filter on it: <ul>
<li> 18+: For real-world violence including physical attacks.
for injuries, gruesome scenes, or explicit language.
</li>
<li> MetaCafe, LLC will reject videos which portray illegal acts of violence or videos that show or imply human fatalities however newsworthy such footage may seem in context.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Dress for success.
Package your videos with killer titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and tags to attract viewers.
But, please, be accurate, or we'll tell all the people you deceived exactly where you sleep.
<ul>
<li> Irresistible Titles: What's in a name? Everything.
Boring titles = no views, so give your video a title no one can resist.
</li>
<li> Teaser Descriptions: Don't you hate it when someone tells you the surprise ending of a movie before you've seen it? ("Dude, did you hear that Darth Vader is Luke's dad?") So go ahead and describe the contents of your video in vivid detail, but don't give away the punch line.
</li>
<li> Eye-Catching Thumbnails: Pick an image from your video that accurately represents its contents and grabs attention.
But if it's something gross, don't show it - we like to eat while browsing the site.
</li>
<li> Tag Away: Use as many tags as you want to describe your video.
That helps people find it in a search.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Pick a channel.
If your video fits more than one channel, choose one that applies most.
Still can't decide? Take a coin, assign one channel to heads, one channel to tails, then flip it.
Later, see a counselor about how you let coins shape your life.
<br>

<p>Last updated: October 3, 2012 </p> Metacafe House Rules <p>We built Metacafe to be a creative community buzzing with energy.
(We love a great buzz.) So we've established a few house rules to keep it going: </p>
<ul>
<li> Helpful Criticism: Want better videos? Then provide suggestions instead of smack! Good advice goes a long way in building a better Web Site.
And if you think you can do better, don't just say it - SHOW IT with your own video.
</li>
<li> Save The Creativity For The Videos: Don't try to sneak onto top lists by manipulating the results.
For example, posting lots of comments on your own video to get onto the "Most Discussed" list won't get you anywhere.
(We've got trained dogs to sniff out cheats.) </li>
<li> Keep It Clean: There are 1,000,000 words in the English language alone, including some cool ones like "nubile," "psychedelic," and "obfuscation." Flaunt your language skills here, and leave the profanity and other garbage talk at home.
</li>
<li> No Haters: Our community has zero tolerance for intolerance, so no defamatory, racist, sexist or homophobic talk.
This includes threats of violence or sexual assault against other site users or people appearing in videos.
Offenders will be banned forever from Web Site.
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We hate playing cops - it takes time away from watching videos and building a killer site - so we hope this little statement does the job of keeping the Metacafe buzz going and growing.<br> Last updated: October 3, 2012 </p>
