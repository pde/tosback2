How We May Allow Others to Collect Your Information
<p>When you use our websites or mobile applications, we may allow third parties to collect device and usage information and location information across your different devices through mobile software development kits, cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies.</p>
<p>These third parties collect this information for the following purposes and for other purposes consistent with their own privacy policies:</p>
<p>
<strong>To Display Ads for Products or Services</strong> – We allow some advertising companies to collect this information in order to display ads that are more relevant to you across your different devices and on our own and others’ websites and mobile apps.
Please see the Your Choices section of this Statement for more information about opting out of targeted advertising and controlling the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To Understand the Use of Our Services</strong> – We allow certain service providers to collect this information to help us understand how our websites and mobile applications are used and to assist us in improving the content and operation of our online properties (e.g., compiling analytics and measuring user engagement with a particular website or feature through A/B testing).
These service providers collect aggregate statistical usage data that is not matched or linked to any individual user.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To Make the Services of Other Companies Work on Our Websites</strong> – We allow companies to use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to enhance the operations of particular services and functionality of our websites and mobile applications.
For example, we allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player.
These cookies are called Flash cookies.
To manage Flash cookies, see the “Your Choices” section below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To Link Your Activity on Our Websites to Your Social Networks</strong> – We have added certain features to our websites and mobile applications that allow social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) to track the activities of their members or collect certain information when they use our website or mobile applications.
These features may include technologies called "plug-ins" and "widgets." Plug-ins create a direct link between two websites, and widgets are interactive mini-programs that provide other companies’ services on our websites.
If you are concerned about the way a social network is tracking your activity, please contact the social network or review its privacy policy.
For example, you can review Facebook’s data-use policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>
7.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies
<p>We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications.
These technologies include first- and third-party cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, entity tags, and HTML local storage.
Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies.
For more information on exercising your preferences in relation to cookies and similar technologies, please see the section of this Statement titled Your Choices.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong> – Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit ("session cookies") or for a fixed period ("persistent cookies").
Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong> – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs," “single pixel gifs", "page tags" or “web bugs." We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>JavaScript</strong> – JavaScript are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Entity Tags</strong> -- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached" within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HTML5 Local Storage</strong> – HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.<br>
<br>
These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes: </p>
<p>
<strong>Services and Functionality</strong> – Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer.
Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance Monitoring</strong> – Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications.
They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating.
When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no directly identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address or phone number) is collected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>User Convenience</strong> – Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marketing</strong> – Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties.
</p>
<p>Taken together, these technologies help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us.
We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.
</p>

How We Protect Your Information
<p>Starbucks protects your information using technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information.
When you transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through our website or in one of our mobile applications, we encrypt the transmission of that information using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
</p>
<p>However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including personal information, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others.
You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices.
</p>
12.
Retention and Disposal of Your Information
<p>Starbucks stores personal information as needed to accomplish the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Our retention of your personal information is governed by applicable law.
This storage period may extend beyond the term of your relationship with Starbucks.
</p>
<p>The personal information that you provide us is stored and processed on servers owned by Starbucks and other companies in the United States, Canada or elsewhere around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located.
Regardless of the company or person who processes your information and where it is processed, we will take steps to transfer and protect your information through appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Privacy Statement.
See also the Participation in Privacy Shield Frameworks section below.
</p>
<p>When personal information is no longer needed, or in any event, after legal authority to retain it has expired, personal information will be destroyed, in accordance with local law and pursuant to procedures established in relation to the relevant Starbucks system or process.
</p>

Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland
<p>This section provides general information about how Starbucks collects, stores, uses, transfers and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of the Privacy Statement, “EEA”), in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations.
This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Starbucks affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Lawful Bases of Processing</strong> – Where a Starbucks entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in the Information We Collect, How We Use Your Information, and How We Share Your Information sections above, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so.
Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to: <ul>
<li>process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering gift cards in accordance with your instructions.
</li>
<li>communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs, contests, and sweepstakes.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for our legitimate business purposes, including to: <ul>
<li>respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information.
</li>
<li>maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the products and services we offer.
</li>
<li>detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud.
and</li>
<li>facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law, and provide important product safety information and notice of product recalls.
and</li>
<li>on the basis of your consent, for example to send you via email and other electronic means personalized promotions and special offers or informing you about our brands, products, events, or other promotional purposes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by modifying your promotional preferences in your Starbucks user account online, or by contacting us as described in the Contact Us section below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your EEA Data Subject Rights</strong> – Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to another party, when possible.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Not be subject to automated decision-making</strong> producing legal or significant effects on an individual, which we do not engage in.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please see the How to Manage Your Account Information and Your Privacy Rights section above, or contact us as set forth in the Contact Us section below and specify which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise.
We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within 30 days of receipt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention</strong> – As described in the Retention and Disposal of Your Information Section above, as a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law.
We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transfers Outside the EEA</strong> – Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States.
It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Starbucks or for our third-party service providers.
In such cases, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection of the recipient as required under the GDPR, including as described in the Participation in the Privacy Shield Frameworks section below for personal data transfers to the United States, and as described in this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Complaints</strong> – If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority (link).
We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us per the Contact Us section below, or to our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
You may also contact our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at any time at privacy@starbucks.com.
