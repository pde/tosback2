All of your Starbucks Cards can be activated and registered for use in Starbucks Rewards, but you may only have one (1) account that is personal to you.
</p>
<p>If you change your account address to one that is not located within Washington D.C., the fifty (50) United States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, your Starbucks Cards will continue to function, but your account will be inactivated.
You will no longer be able to earn Stars or receive or redeem benefits under your U.S.
Starbucks Rewards account.
Previously earned Stars may expire as described below.
</p>
<p>EARNING STARS</p>
<p>The benefits that are available to you through Starbucks Rewards are based on the number of “Stars" that you earn.
You can earn Stars by making purchases using any Starbucks Card registered to your Starbucks Rewards account to pay at participating Starbucks stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland.
</p>
<p>You will earn Stars based on the value of your purchase at the rate of two (2) Stars for each One Dollar ($1.00) you spend at participating Starbucks stores using your registered Starbucks Card.
If you are a Starbucks partner (employee), you will earn Stars at the rate of three (3) Stars for each One Dollar ($1.00) you spend using any registered Starbucks Card so long as you have registered your “partner" Starbucks Card to the same Starbucks Rewards account.
Some exclusions apply.
For example, you cannot earn Stars on purchases of alcoholic beverages or on Starbucks Cards (including activations, reloads, transfers, or any other card-to-card transaction).
Taxes, tips, donations, and fees, including without limitation, shipping and handling fees, gift wrapping fees, delivery fees, and bag fees, may also be excluded and ineligible for Star accrual.
Stars may be earned and awarded in fractional amounts depending on the value of your purchase.
If your account is established in the U.S., any qualifying purchase made using your registered Starbucks Card at participating stores in Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom or Ireland, will earn Stars as if the currency were expressed in U.S.
Dollars.
No currency exchange is applied to the value of your purchase for the purpose of determining how many Stars you have earned.
For example, if the value of your purchase is One Canadian Dollar or One Pound (United Kingdom), you will earn two (2) Stars.
</p>
<p>Generally, Stars for qualifying purchases from participating stores are automatically added to your account within twenty-four (24) hours.
From time to time, we, or others acting with our permission, may offer you special promotions that offer you “Promotional Stars." Promotional Stars, such as “bonus" Stars, will be awarded as described in the applicable promotional offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth in the promotional offer.
</p>
<p>You can also earn Stars by entering Star codes at starbucks.com/rewards.
Star codes may be found on or inside specially marked packages of Starbucks branded products sold by other retailers such as grocery stores, and may, from time to time, be distributed through promotional materials.
The amount of Stars awarded using Star codes may vary by product and price.
You can redeem a maximum of two (2) Star codes per day.
Certain other limitations may apply to Star codes.
For example, there may be a limit on the number of Star codes that you can enter on a daily basis, and Star codes have expiration dates.
Check the product packaging and/or promotional materials for specific restrictions applicable to a particular Star code.
</p>
<p>You may also earn Stars through receipt verification when you purchase qualifying Starbucks products from participating retailers and submit a photo of your receipt at www.starbucks-stars.com.
To earn Stars through receipt verification, you must comply with the Starbucks Rewards Receipt Verification Terms &amp.
Conditions.
Certain limitations may apply to the receipt verification program.
For example, you are not eligible to earn Stars on receipts from online retailers.
Visit www.starbucks-stars.com for more information.
</p>
<p>Eligible customers may also earn Stars through participation in programs offered by our business partners.
Starbucks does not operate and is not responsible for these programs, which have separate and additional terms and conditions governing how Stars may be earned.
</p>
<p>If you void a purchase made with your registered Starbucks Card, Starbucks will deduct the Stars that you were awarded for that purchase, potentially resulting in a negative Star balance on your account.
If you return merchandise or packaged coffee, food and tea that you purchased with your registered Starbucks Card (note: an original receipt or gift receipt is required), your funds will be returned to you on a Starbucks store credit card, but Starbucks will not deduct Stars from your account.
Starbucks store credit cards may be used in any participating Starbucks store, but they are not Starbucks Cards.
For example, store credit cards do not accrue Stars and cannot be registered or reloaded for additional value.
</p>
<p>If you use multiple forms of payment in one transaction, such as cash, credit card, or an unregistered Starbucks Card, the registered Starbucks Card that you use will be awarded a prorated number of Stars based on the eligible purchase amount that was applied to your registered Starbucks Card.
</p>
<p>STARBUCKS REWARDS LEVELS</p>
<p>Currently, there are two (2) levels of benefits within Starbucks Rewards that are determined by the number of Stars that you accumulate in your account each year.
By opening an account and registering a Starbucks Card, you will be automatically enrolled in Starbucks Rewards at the Green Level.
If you earn at least three hundred (300) Stars within the twelve (12) month period following your enrollment date, you will qualify for the Gold Level.
</p>
<p>Once you reach a specific level within Starbucks Rewards, you will receive the benefits that are applicable to that level at that time.
However, you must continue to earn and accumulate Stars in order to maintain your benefit level.
</p>
<p>To maintain all benefits of the Green Level, you must earn at least one (1) new Star during each consecutive 12-month period following your enrollment date.
If you do not earn at least one (1) new Star in each 12-month period, your Star balance will automatically reset to zero (0) and you may no longer be eligible to receive Starbucks Rewards benefits.
<strong>If you do not earn at least three hundred (300) new Stars in each consecutive 12-month period, your Stars will expire and your Star balance will automatically reset to zero (0).
</strong>
</p>
<p>To maintain the Gold Level, you must earn at least three hundred (300) new Stars during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reached the Gold Level.
If you do not earn 300 new Stars in 12 months, you will be placed at the Green Level of Starbucks Rewards and your Star balance will automatically reset to zero (0).
If you fail to requalify for the Gold Level, and you have between 125 and 299 Stars in your account, Starbucks will add one (1) free food or drink Reward onto your account (subject to the Gold Level exclusions and restrictions described below).
This Reward will be loaded onto your account on your requalification date and will be available for you to use at participating stores for a period of thirty (30) days.
If you have provided Starbucks with a current, valid email address, you will receive an email from Starbucks approximately twenty-four (24) hours after the coupon is loaded to your account indicating that your Reward is available to you.
