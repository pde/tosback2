<b>Customer Proprietary Network Information. </b>Visible customers may choose to limit the use and sharing of Customer Propriety Network Information (or “CPNI”) among Visible’s affiliates, which includes the Verizon family of companies, for the purpose of marketing communications-related services that are different from those you currently have.

Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.
Notice about Visible’s use and sharing of CPNI and the choices you have may be provided in your monthly statement or in other ways.

<b>Cookies. </b>You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your web browser settings.
Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section).
If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of our apps or sites may no longer be available to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. </b>Some web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
