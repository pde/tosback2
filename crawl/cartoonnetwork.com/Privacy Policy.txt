Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, and to help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this Privacy Statement summarizing our online information practices and explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
This Privacy Statement, where posted, applies to our information practices on Cartoon Network's Web sites (the "Sites") and for products and services we make available on various mobile devices or other platforms ("Apps").
This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other information collected by Cartoon Network and its affiliated entities through any other means.

<p>Cartoon Network is committed to providing fun, safe and secure Sites and Apps for people of all ages.
We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.
Because many visitors to the Sites are children, we make efforts to ensure that children access only the content that is appropriate for them.
In addition, we employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online.
We do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact information.</p>
<p>As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time.</p>

For some activities, such as online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable.
This might include first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a favorite cartoon character.
For some other activities, such as entering sweepstakes and subscribing to our e-mail newsletters, we may ask visitors to provide a first name and e-mail address.
For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend, we may also ask for personal information about other people.
This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address.
E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted immediately when the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted.
For some limited activities, campaigns, or offers, intended for parents and adults, we may ask a parent or adult to provide their name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, cable or satellite provider, and/or information about their interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.
