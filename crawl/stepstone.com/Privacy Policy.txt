<strong>Purposes and legal basis of the data processing and period for which data will be stored</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following we inform you about the different purposes for which we process personal data, on which legal basis such processing takes place, and for how long we store the data.</p>
<p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art.
6 (1) (a) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art.
6 (1) (b) GDPR will be the legal basis.
This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
If processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to, Art.
6 (1) (c) GDPR is the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.</p>
<p>The personal data of the data subject will be stored for as long as the purpose continues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>General access to our Platforms</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With each access to our Platforms, we automatically collect data and information from the accessing device and store this data and information in the log files of the server.
We may collect (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (known as referrers), (4) the sub-web pages that are accessed on our website (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information used to defend any attacks against our IT systems.
For security purposes, i.e.
to be able to reconstruct an eventual attack against our Platforms, we store such data including the IP address for 14 days and then anonymize or delete such data.
The IP address is required during the connection to transfer the contents of our Platform to your device.
The legal basis for the processing and storage of the IP address is a legitimate interest as per Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legitimate interest for the transmission of the IP address is that it is required to display the contents of the website.
without transmission of the IP address it is not possible to display the content of the Platform.
The legimtiate interest for the temporary storage are our security interests.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Optimization of search and recommendation functions</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also store information about your usage patterns on our Platforms in order to create statistical models to make our Platforms more user-friendly and, in particular, to optimize the functionalities to search for and recommend suitable job advertisements.
In this context we also save your IP address in a pseudonymized form (that means that a natural person can no longer be identified based purely on the information in the statistical model) to exclude automated accesses (bots) to our Platforms when creating the statistical models.
Legal basis for this purpose is Art.
6 (1) GDPR.
Our legitimate interest is to ensure the functionality of the statistical model to improve our services.
The IP address is deleted after one year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Contact form and e-mail contact</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Platforms provide contact forms that can be used to contact us electronically.
By clicking the “Send” button, you consent to the transmission to us of the data entered in the input form.
In addition, we save the date and time of your contact.
Alternatively, contact via the e-mail address provided is possible.
In this case, the user’s personal data transmitted along with e-mail and our response will be stored.
The personal data voluntarily transmitted to us in this context is used to process your inquiry and to contact you as needed.
The legal basis for the transmission of the data is Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR.
The data will be used for this purpose until the specific conversation with you has ended.
The conversation will be deemed ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Use of data processors for hosting and securing our platforms, administrative, troubleshooting, and support services</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use data processors, which we list below, to provide our services.
The legal basis for using these data processors is legitimate interest under Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legitimate interest lies in the execution of our business activities, particularly to provide the services described elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy.
No conflicting interest is apparent because we have entered into a data processing agreement with the respective processors under Art.
28 GDPR.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hosting</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use data processors to host our Platforms and for back-up services, meaning that personal data that is stored on our platforms is transferred to these data processors.
These data processors are Amazon Webservices, Inc., 410 Terry Drive Ave North, WA 98109-5210 Seattle, USA (who processes data solely in the EU), StepStone GmbH, Axel-Springer-Str.
65, 10969 Berlin, Germany, StepStone Continental Europe GmbH, Völklinger Straße 1, 40219 Düsseldorf, Germany and StepStone N.V., Koningsstraat 47 Rue Royale, 1000 Brussels Belgium.
These data processors will store the data for the same duration as it is stored on our Platforms for the various purposes defined in this Data Protection Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Administrative, troubleshooting, and support services</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use StepStone Services sp.
z o.o., ul.
Domaniewska 50, 02-672 Warsaw, Poland, for administrative, troubleshooting, and support services, and which may consequently also have access to your personal data.
Generally StepStone Services sp.
z o.o should not store any personal data.
This will only be done in exceptional cases, e.g.
if needed to rectify technical issues.
In such cases personal data will only be stored to the extent and for the duration that is necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sending of e-mails and other messages</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sending of e-mails and messages through other electronic channels we use the services of Selligent GmbH, Atelierstraße 12, 81671 Munich, Germany, as a data processor, who in turn uses the following subcontractors</p>
<ul>
<li>Selligent Benelux NV, Kempische Steenweg, 305 box 401 Belgium</li>
<li>Selligent International, Avenue de Finlande 2 box 2, 1420 Braine-L’Alleud, Belgium</li>
<li>Selligent France SA, 20 Place des Vins de France RCS, 75012 Paris, France</li>
<li>Selligent SA, 1420 Braine-l’Alleud, 2 avenue de Finlande, Belgium</li>
<li>Selligent Iberica S.L.U, Caille Enrique Granados 86-88, Planta 3 °, 0008 Barcelona, ​​Spain</li>
<li>Selligent Ltd, Second Floor, 45 Folgate Street, London E1 6GL, United Kingdom</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, these parties may also be provided with your personal data in the course of data processing commissioned by us.
It will be stored there for a period that is otherwise lawful for purposes under this Data Protection Policy, i.e.
in particular for the contractual communications in the course of contracts with you or otherwise for promotional communications.</p>
<p>The legal basis for our use of Selligent is a legitimate interest under Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely the execution of our business purposes in the course of the processes described elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy.
No conflicting interest is apparent in this respect, in particular due to the fact that we have entered into a data processing agreement with Selligent.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Proxy caching and web application firewall</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use Akamai Technologies GmbH, Parkring 20-22, 85748 Garching, Germany and Akamai Technologies, Inc., 150 Broadway, Cambridge, 02142 MA, USA as data processors for the purposes of proxy caching and web application firewall services.
That means that any visit to our websites is routed through the servers of Akamai, meaning that the user will not be connected directly to our servers but to those of Akamai and Akamai will then request the content from our servers and will deliver it to the user.
Proxy caching in this context means that Akamai will cache selected content (but not personal data) for a period of 24 hours, so that this can be delivered faster to you.
The web application firewall means that Akamai will try to identify malicious web traffic and will prevent it from accessing our websites.
Akamai does not store any personal data, but any dataflows between our servers and the user will be routed through Akamai, so that this can also include personal data.
Data transferred to Akamai Technologies, Inc is transferred outside the EU and the EEA.
This is permissible under Art.
45 GDPR because Akamai Technologies, Inc is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250 (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&amp;from=DE).
The certification can be viewed at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000Gn4RAAS&amp;status=Active.</p>
<p>With respect to Akamai, the additional legitimate interest in the context of the legal basis is that we thereby are also implementing technical and organizational measures to protect our Platforms and the personal data stored on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Re-Captcha</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In specific cases we use the reCAPTCHA service https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/ by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”) based on a legitimate interest (i.e.
the interest to ensure the correctness of data, avoidance of automatic registrations / orders by so-called bots, and economical operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) f) GDPR).</p>
<p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus warrants that it complies with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).</p>
<p>We use re-Captcha to distinguish whether an input is made by a human or abusively by automated, mechanical processing.
The query in this context includes the sending of the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google.
Your input will be transmitted to Google and analyzed for this purpose.</p>

If you opt out of accepting cookies, the functionality of our website may be limited.
We deal with specific cookies or similar technology below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Technically necessary cookies</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use technical cookies.
These are cookies that are merely required to collect certain information on our Platforms to provide a service required or wanted by you as user.
This extends to navigation or session cookies that enable smooth navigation and use of the website (and for instance permit access to the restricted area).
analysis cookies that are set directly by us to collect aggregated information about the number of users and their behavior.

<p>The legal basis for these cookies is a legitimate interest under Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely pursuance of our business purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookies and technologies that we use via third party providers</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use cookies or other technology provided to us by external providers in various areas.
In the following, we inform you about the respective providers and how you can object to the cookie or the corresponding technology.
In general, in the case of websites, you can make an appropriate setting in your browser and in case of our apps you can make the respective setting with the slider for anonymous statistics under “Settings”.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Firebase</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our apps we use technology from Google Firebase (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, “Google”) with various functionalities.</p>
<p>Firebase Analytics enables the analysis of the use of our apps.
This completely aonymized information about the use of our app is collected and transmitted to Google and stored there.
Google uses the advertising ID of the device.
Google will use this information to evaluate the use of our app and to provide us with other services related to the use of apps.
In Device Settings, you can restrict the use of the Advertising ID (iOS: Privacy / Advertising / No Ad Tracking, Android: Account / Google / View).
Google Analytics for Firebase (Google Inc.).
We also use Firebase Remote Config, which allows us to run A / B tests and customize the behavior and appearance of the app without having to download a new version.
Personal data is not stored.</p>
<p>Google Inc.
is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).
Subcontractors that Google can use can be found here: https://firebase.google.com/terms/subprocessors.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the use of data analysis and the use of Firebase is a legitimate interest (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our apps) within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR).</p>
<p>You can opt-out of using Firebase at any time by changing the setting of the slider for anonymous statistics in the app under “Settings”.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Conversion Tracking</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the grounds of our legitimate interests (i.e.
interest in the analysis, optimization, and economical operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR), we use the marketing and remarketing services (for short: “Google Marketing Services”) of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).</p>
<p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus warrants that it complies with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).</p>
<p>The Google Marketing Services enable us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted manner to so that users are only shown advertisements that they may be interested in.
If a user sees e.g.
advertisements for products that he or she was interested in on other websites, this is referred to as “remarketing”.
For this purpose, when our websites and other websites are accessed on which Google Marketing Services are active, Google directly executes a Google code and what are termed (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are integrated into the website.
These are used to store an individual cookie, i.e.
a small file on the user’s device (comparable technologies may also be used instead of cookies).
The cookies may be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com.
This file records which websites the user searches for, the content he or she is interested in and which offers he or she has clicked.
It also stores technical information on the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit, and other information on the use of the online offering.
Similarly, the user’s IP address is recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we state that the IP address is shortened in within Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases is it transferred in full to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
The IP address is not merged with the user’s data within other Google offerings.
Google may also combine the above information with information from other sources.
If the user subsequently visits other websites, tailored advertisements can be displayed depending on his or her interests.</p>
<p>The user’s data is processed in a pseudonimyzed form as part of the Google Marketing Services.
This means that Google stores and processes e.g.
not the user’s name or e-mail address, but instead processes the relevant data based on the cookie within pseudonymized user profiles.
This means that, from Google’s perspective, the advertisements are not managed and displayed for a specifically identifiable person, but for the holder of the cookie, irrespective of who the holder of this cookie is.
This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.
The information about the user collected by Google Marketing Services is transferred to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.</p>
<p>The Google Marketing Services deployed by us include the “Google AdWords” online advertising program.
Google AdWords supplies every AdWords customer with a different “conversion cookie”.
This means that cookies cannot be traced via the websites of AdWords customers.
The information obtained using the cookie enables conversion statistics for AdWords customers to be produced who have opted for conversion tracking.
The AdWords customers are notified of the total number of users who clicked their advertisement and were forwarded to a page containing a conversion tracking tag.
However, they are not given any information that could be used to personally identify users.</p>
<p>We may involve third parties on the basis of the “DoubleClick” Google marketing services.
DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to place advertisements on the basis of users’ visits to this website and other websites on the Internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may deploy the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google analytics and marketing service within our website.</p>
<p>For further information on data usage for marketing purposes by Google, refer to the overview page: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/advertisements.
Google’s privacy policy can be accessed at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt out of interest-driven advertising from Google Marketing Services, you can use the settings and opt-out options provided by Google: http://www.google.com/advertisements/preferences.</p>
