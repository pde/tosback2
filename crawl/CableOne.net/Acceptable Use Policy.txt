</p> III.
NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND LIMITATIONS ON BANDWIDTH CONSUMPTION AND DATA STORAGE <p>The Cable One network is designed for typical usage by a typical residential computer user.
Computer activity resulting in excessive or sustained bandwidth consumption may burden the network and such usage may be restricted.
Bandwidth on our network is a limited, shared resource among subscribers.
Because we seek to provide the Service at a reasonable cost to the largest number of users, the use of our network is subject to usage limitations.
Users therefore must comply with the current bandwidth, data throughput, file storage and other limitations on the Service.
Users must ensure their activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other user's use of the Service, nor represent (in the sole but reasonable judgment of Cable One) an unusually large burden on the network itself.
In addition, users must ensure that their activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Cable One's ability to deliver the Service and monitor the Services, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services.
Cable One is committed to ensuring each customer use their fair share in order to keep the Service as affordable as possible for all.</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One manage its Network?</strong>
<br> Cable One strives to provide customers the best experience when using our network, a shared resource among hundreds of thousands of customers.
To help achieve this, if you use an extraordinary amount of data, based on your data plan or service level, and fall within the top 5% of Cable One’s data users we may reduce your data throughput speeds periodically for the remainder of your then current billing cycle and next billing cycle to ensure high quality network performance for other users during times of peak demand.
Our proactive management of the Cable One network and the Service is designed to ensure that the remaining 95% of data customers aren't negatively affected by the inordinate data consumption of just a few users.</p>
<p> Cable One also may also use other tools and techniques to manage its network, deliver the Service, and ensure compliance with this Policy and the Subscriber Agreement.
These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the network and its usage, and can and do change frequently.
For example, these network management activities may include (i) identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer e-mail accounts, (ii) detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, (iii) limiting speeds during periods of extended congestion, (iv) requiring an upgrade or purchase of a different data plan, and (v) using other tools or techniques that Cable One may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best broadband Internet experience to all its customers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One track usage?</strong>
<br> We collect data on customer traffic pattern usage through the use of traffic management software.
Cable One reserves the right to conduct tests to improve network security, to enhance the performance of our network, and to determine whether to make available new service offerings.
These technical tests are performed almost continuously and without notice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is Excessive Use?</strong>
<br> Excessive use means bandwidth or data usage that is significantly higher than typical usage for which our network is designed.
Excessive Users consume so much data that their usage could negatively impact the Service provided to other customers.
</p>
<p> Excessive Users demonstrate sustained usage patterns at high volumes over many hours.
These patterns are consistent with unattended usage and create a costly burden on the network, especially during peak usage hours.
Excessive users are those who exceed the following daily threshold more than one-half of the days in their billing cycle:</p>
<strong>Excessive Use Daily Threshold <br> (combined upstream &amp.
downstream)</strong> Tier Economy Standard <br> (5 mbps only) Standard (Preferred or Elite Plans w/ 50 Meg Upgrade) Premium <br> (10 mbps) Ultra <br> (12 mbps) Threshold Not applicable 3 Gigabytes Data Plan Applies 5 Gigabytes 10 Gigabytes <p>
<strong>How does Cable One address Excessive Use or uncharacteristic use?</strong>
<br> The Cable One residential service offering is a consumer product designed for personal use of the Internet.
Therefore, if Cable One in its sole but reasonable discretion determines that a customer has exceeded the Excessive Use threshold or is using the Service in a manner significantly uncharacteristic of a typical residential user, Cable One reserves the right to (a) adjust, suspend or terminate Service accounts at any time and without notice.
or (b) require the user to upgrade his service level or pay additional fees in accordance with Cable One’s then-current, applicable rates and charges for such Service.
or (c) use any technology to be chosen by Cable One at its sole discretion to slow the user’s service for purposes of conserving bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What activities may cause excessive bandwidth consumption and uncharacteristic use?</strong>
<br> Common activities that may cause excessive bandwidth consumption in violation of this Policy include, but are not limited to, numerous or continuous bulk transfers of files and other high capacity traffic using (i) file transfer protocol ("FTP"), (ii) peer-to-peer applications, and (iii) newsgroups, whether provided by Cable One or a third party.
Usage uncharacteristic of a residential account includes factors such as sustained high usage day and evening, consumption of data greater than 95% of other customers or numerous simultaneous connections.</p>
<p>
<strong>What services are restricted to Residential service users?</strong>
<br> The Service does not provide the type of security, upstream performance and total downstream throughput capability typically associated with commercial use.
You may not run a server in connection with the Cable One residential service, nor may you provide network services to others via the Cable One residential service .
Examples of prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, running servers for mail (pop3 &amp.
smtp), http, https, FTP, IRC, DHCP and multi-user interactive forums.
For information about commercial Internet pricing, please see http://www.Cable One.net.</p>
<p>
<strong>What are the Economy Plan policies?</strong>
<br> Cable One offers different service plan options that accommodate different levels of usage at different price points.
The Economy plan is a specific service plan that is intended to provide a lower cost option for customers who are light or only occasional users of the Service.
The plan offers an initial allocation of service “bytes” which is replenished monthly.
The initial allocation is one gigabyte of usage per month, as measured between noon and midnight during each calendar day of the month.
The noon to midnight period is measured based on the local time of the user.
Bytes used between midnight and noon of each day are not counted against the plan’s monthly allocation.
The monthly period is the same as the user’s billing period.
If a user that subscribes to the Economy plan exceeds the allocated monthly bandwidth of one gigabyte, Cable One automatically will allocate a second Gigabyte to the user for a fee set forth in the subscriber agreement.
If the user exceeds the bandwidth allocated by this second Gigabyte, then Cable One automatically will allocate a third Gigabyte to the user for a fee set forth in the subscriber agreement, and so on.
This incremental allocation of gigabytes is valid only for the billing cycle during which it was allocated and cannot be carried forward.
The total number of Gigabyte allocations and related fees charged to the user in the Economy plan is capped in the subscriber agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>What are Data Plan policies?</strong>
<br> Elite/Preferred Contract or Post Contract Customers: Certain packages or combinations of services, available under contract, offer 5Mbps service upgraded to 50Mbps along with a data plan.
The current data plan offering is shown below (Table 1) and is subject to change.
When the user’s contract ends, the user retains the upgraded speed and the data plan so long as they maintain their package/services from their contract.
Users who exceed their plan’s data allocation will be charged $0.50 per additional gigabyte.
</p>
<strong>Data Plans for Elite &amp.

If during the first 90 days of usage, you exceed your data plan, the additional data usage fees will be waived upon request from you.
Customers under contract who exceed their data plan after the first 90 days of their agreement can terminate their contract and not be subject to the early termination fees as specified in the early termination section.
</p>
<p> </p> IV.
VIOLATION OF THIS ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY <p>
<strong>What happens if you violate this policy?</strong>
<br> Cable One reserves the right to suspend without notice or terminate the Service and your Subscriber Agreement if you violate the terms of this Policy or the Subscriber Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One enforce this Policy?</strong>
<br> Cable One does not routinely monitor the activity of accounts for violation of this Policy.
However, in our efforts to comply with applicable law and promote good citizenship within the Internet community, we will respond appropriately if we become aware of inappropriate use of our Services.
If we receive notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
sec.
512, that you have allegedly infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party, we retain the right to take down or disable access to the allegedly infringing material.
In complying with applicable law in this area, it is our policy, in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of subscribers who repeatedly infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
We also will take such other action as appropriate under the circumstances to preserve our rights.
Although Cable One has no obligation to monitor the Services and/or the network, Cable One reserves the right to monitor bandwidth, usage, and content from time to time to operate the Services.
to identify violations of this Policy.
and/or to protect the network and Cable One users.
Cable One prefers to advise customers of inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action.
However, if the Services are used in a way which Cable One, in its sole but reasonable discretion, believes violate this Policy, Cable One may take any responsive actions it deems appropriate.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Services.
Cable One will not have any liability for any such responsive actions.
The above described actions are not Cable One's exclusive remedies and Cable One may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.
Cable One reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Policy, including the gathering of information from the user or users involved and the complaining party, if any, and examination of material on Cable One's servers and network.
During an investigation, Cable One may suspend the account or accounts involved and/or remove material which potentially violates this Policy.
You hereby authorize Cable One to cooperate with (i) law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations, and (ii) and system administrators at other Internet service providers or other network or computing facilities in order to enforce this Policy.
Such cooperation may include Cable One providing the username, IP address, or other identifying information about a subscriber.
Upon termination of an account, Cable One is authorized to delete any user ID, files, programs, data and email messages associated with such account.
The failure of Cable One to enforce this Policy, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any time.
You agree that, if any portion of this Policy is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.
This Policy shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Arizona.
</p> V.
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS <p>
<strong>Cable Modems </strong>
<br> Cable One strives to produce a high level of reliability, stability and security for our High Speed Internet Subscribers.
The cable modem is a critical network element which we constantly evaluate for compatibility and performance.
Due to technical limitations, changes to our network, discontinued support by manufacturers, regulatory obligations, or defects, certain cable modem models that previously were certified may be deemed to no longer be suitable for our network.
If you own your modem and in our sole but reasonable discretion it becomes unsuitable for any of these or other reasons, it will be your responsibility to purchase a new modem.
Cable One’s support web site maintains a current list of certified modems for use on its network.
Cable One reserves the right to upgrade, via software download and without subscriber notification, all cable modems currently connected to its network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communication</strong>
<br> Cable One may choose to communicate with you regarding these policies using a variety of methods including email to your Cable One email address or in-browser notices.
In-browser notices are an effective way to quickly alert you to important service-impacting issues.
These notices may require you to acknowledge receipt of the message or log into your Cable One account for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limitations of Liability </strong>
<br> Cable One will make reasonable efforts to provide customer with uninterrupted and error-free service.
Nonetheless, there are numerous factors that could affect the Service.
Temporary interruptions of the Service may occur as normal events in the provision of the Service.
Cable One reserves the right to interrupt the Service usually between the hours of 1am to 5am (MST or Local) for maintenance purposes.
Also understand that Cable One has no control over the networks, facilities or services of third parties and that delays and disruptions involving them are completely beyond Cable One's control.
As to Cable One’s own equipment and software, failure may occur without warning due to causes ranging from our own errors to malicious attack.
If you have requirements that substantially exceed the average consumer’s bandwidth use or if continuous Internet access is the basis of your livelihood, you should purchase an alternate, backup connection.
While Cable One employs virus and spam checking software, the speed of new virus and spam creation is such that Cable One does not represent or warrant that traffic on its network will be virus or spam free.
In light of that, your use of the Service is at your own risk and the Service is provided without warranty or guarantee of any kind either expressed or implied, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Without limiting the foregoing, Cable One, its parent company and affiliates will not be liable for any interruptions in service or failure to perform or partial performance that results in corrupted transmissions and will not be responsible for consequential damages of any sort.
In any event, Cable One’s liability to you for all potential claims will not exceed the total amount of service fees paid during the preceding three months.
As to consumer customers, some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.
Nothing in this Agreement gives you any interest, title or license in the user ID, electronic mail address or IP address that is used in conjunction with the Service.
