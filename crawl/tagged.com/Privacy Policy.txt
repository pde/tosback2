</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu of arbitration, either you and/or
Tagged may bring an individual action against the other in small claims court.
Additionally, you and/or Tagged may bring any Claim against the other to the
attention of a federal, state and/or local government entity, which may elect
to seek relief against Tagged on your behalf, and/or against you on Tagged's behalf.</p>
<p>You agree that you and Tagged hereby have voluntarily and intentionally
waived any and all right to a trial by jury, and (except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement) any and all right to participate
in a class action.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
and enforcement of this Dispute provision.
This Dispute provision shall
survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>For a party hereto to initiate arbitration against the other party
it must first send by certified mail to the other party a written
Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice must identify and detail
the nature of the party's Claim, the basis for that Claim, and the
specific relief being sought for that Claim, including, without
limitation, any Claim for injunctive relief.
For the parties'
convenience, a form for providing Notice is available at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution_forms.html
to download and complete.
A Notice being
sent to Tagged must be addressed to: Dispute Resolution Department, Tagged,
Inc., 110 Pacific Ave Mall, Box #117, San Francisco, CA 94111 ("Tagged Notice
Address").
A Notice being sent to you shall be sent to your Tagged e-mail
account and to any other e-mail address provided in your registration
(collectively, "Member Notice Address").
You may also opt to receive a
copy of any Notice via mail by sending a written request to the Tagged
Notice Address including your name, postal address, Member Notice Address
and Tagged User ID number (UID).</p>
<p>After receipt of the Notice you and Tagged must attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute set forth in the Notice.
If you and Tagged are
not able to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received,
then you or Tagged may initiate an arbitration proceeding against the other
by downloading and completing the "American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
Consumer-Related-Disputes Form-California (For Use Only In California)"
demand for arbitration form available at (http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=6377)
("Demand"), and sending a copy of the Demand to the AAA, together with a
copy of the Tagged Terms of Service and a check or money order payable to
the AAA in the amount of the appropriate filing fee, and sending a copy of
the Demand to the other party.
The copy of the Demand being sent to the
AAA must be addressed as stated on the Demand.
A copy of the Demand being
sent to Tagged must be addressed to the Tagged Notice Address.
A copy of
the Demand being sent to you shall be addressed to the Member Notice Address.</p>
<p>Please note AAA does not provide Tagged customer support and is only able to
provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against Tagged.
All concerns regarding your account should be addressed to Tagged by submitting a
Ticket.
Tagged will try to resolve your concern, and in the case that you are not satisfied with
the resolution you may choose to follow the process outlined on the
Dispute Resolution Page.</p>
<p>Information regarding the appropriate filing fee to send with the Demand
to the AAA (including the possible waiver of all or part of that fee) is
available at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22039 and http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22040,
or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879 or AAA Case Filing Services
at (877) 495-4185.
Note: AAA does not provide Tagged customer support and is only
able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against Tagged.
If you initiate an arbitration proceeding against Tagged
and are not able to pay all or part of the AAA filing fee (and do not receive
a waiver of the unpayable amount), and so long as the total amount of the
relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send a
written request for payment of the unpayable amount to Tagged at the Tagged
Notice Address.
Tagged shall consider your request and will, in its own
discretion, either (1) pay the unpayable amount to the AAA directly or (2)
send notice to you of its denial of your request within 10 business days of
the receipt thereof.
Further, if you initiate an arbitration proceeding
against Tagged, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are
seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send proof of your
payment of all or part of the AAA filing fee to Tagged at the Tagged Notice
Address, and Tagged shall reimburse you for that actually paid amount.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA and shall be governed
by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and the
AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively,
"AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available
online at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22440 and http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22014,
or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879.
(Additional information
about the arbitration process, presented in a simplified FAQ format, is available
at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html.
The arbitrator selected to resolve
the dispute between you and Tagged shall bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in San Francisco County,
California.
Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are
seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration
shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the
AAA Rules.
If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then
your and Tagged's respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined
by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted
the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.</p>
<p>In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above,
and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration
is $10,000 or less, Tagged shall pay all other AAA administration fees and
all arbitrator fees for the arbitration.
Except, however, that if the arbitrator
in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against Tagged
or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an
improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and
arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In said
event, you hereby agree to reimburse Tagged for all monies paid by Tagged that
are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Additionally, if the total
amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000
then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall
be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>You and Tagged agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the
monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or Tagged is
entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor
Tagged shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement
offer(s) that you and/or Tagged previously made to the other in connection
with said dispute.
In any individual arbitration between you and Tagged,
if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of
Tagged's last written settlement offer to you then Tagged shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the "Member Incentive"),
whichever is greater.
and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and
reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness
fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues
in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against Tagged
in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer
to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing
you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary
relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged, you and your
attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive
and the Attorney Incentive, respectively.
The arbitrator may make
rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney
Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon
request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the arbitrator's
ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration.
The Attorney
Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have
under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in
connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded
to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a
duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses.
If Tagged
prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled
under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses,
Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to
receive such an award.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your
favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim.
You and Tagged agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Agreement, you and Tagged may bring a Claim against the other
solely in your or Tagged's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff
or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding,
and, except as otherwise set forth herein, no arbitrator may consolidate
more than one person's Claim and/or otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding.
If all or part of this specific
paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable
after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall
be deemed null and void.</p>
<p>AT ANY TIME AND IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION TAGGED MAY DIRECT THE
AAA TO CONSOLIDATE ANY AND ALL PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION
CLAIMS THAT (i) ARISE IN SUBSTANTIAL PART FROM THE SAME AND/OR
RELATED TRANSACTIONS, EVENTS AND/OR OCCURRENCES, AND (ii) INVOLVE
A COMMON QUESTION OF LAW AND/OR FACT WHICH, IF RESOLVED IN
MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS,
MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTING AND/OR INCONSISTENT RESULTS.
IN SAID EVENT,
YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION, IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL
ARBITRATION, OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST TAGGED AND
THE AAA RULES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL GOVERN ALL PARTIES.
Additionally, in said event, if the arbitrator issues you an
award that is greater than the value of Tagged's last written
settlement offer to you then Tagged shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay you the amount of the award or three times the amount
of Tagged's last written settlement offer to you (the "Member
Incentive"), whichever is greater.
and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees,
and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert
witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and
actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your
Claim against Tagged in the arbitration (collectively, the
"Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer
to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration
issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you
any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged,
then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever
is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive
the Attorney Incentive.
As also noted above, the arbitrator may
make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement
of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the
Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration
and/or upon request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the
arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration.
Similarly,
the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right
you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or
expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including
as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may
you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses.
If Tagged prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and
is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or
expenses, Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall
refuse to receive such an award.
If all or part of this specific
paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute
provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, you agree that if Tagged changes this Dispute provision
in the future (other than a change to the Tagged Notice Address
and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title
set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by
sending written notice within 30 days of the change to Tagged at
the Tagged Notice Address.
By rejecting said change you reaffirm
that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and Tagged
solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or any
third party, Tagged is under no obligation to become involved.
In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more members,
Member hereby releases Tagged and its directors, officers, employees,
agents, independent contractors, representatives, parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and licensees from
all claims, actions, losses, liabilities, judgments, damages,
costs and expenses of every kind or nature (regardless of whether
actual or consequential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
disclosed or undisclosed), arising out of or in any way related to
such disputes and/or any the Services.
If Member is a California
resident, Member hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542,
which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her
must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
M) Termination
<p>Either party may terminate use of the Tagged website or the Services
with or without cause at any time and effective immediately upon written
notice to the other party.
Tagged may terminate with or without cause at
any time and effective immediately, at Tagged's sole discretion,
including but not limited to Member's failure to conform with these
terms and conditions of the Agreement.
Tagged shall not be liable to
Member or any third party for termination of use of Tagged or the
Services.
Member's right to use Tagged or the Services shall cease
immediately.
Member shall have no right and Tagged will have no
obligation thereafter to forward any unread or unsent messages to Member
or any third party.

Agreement.</p>

<p>Updated as of September 30, 2011</p>
User Privacy
<p>Tagged is a social discovery website that lets you meet and interact with
new people and stay in touch with friends.
Like any website that offers a service
where you register and provide information about yourself or your
opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information.
At
Tagged we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to
explain how information is collected on our website, and how this
information is used.
Members Must Be 13 years of age or older.
Tagged is
intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older.
All persons
under 13 are prohibited from registering on Tagged.</p>
How Does Tagged Protect Children's Privacy?
<p>The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us.</p>
<p>Tagged is a general audience web site that complies with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Our registration
process is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from
becoming members of Tagged and using our site.
If we receive
information suggesting that a user who has registered with Tagged is
under the age of 13, we require the user to provide evidence confirming
that the user is at least 13 years old.
If the user fails to provide
such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the user's
account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying
on the site.</p>
What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that
commercial web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances)
prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information from
children whom they know to be under the age of 13.
In addition, COPPA
requires that web sites that collect personal information from children
under the age of 13 provide parents with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice.
Parents must be provided notice regarding what information
is collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the
information may be shared.</li>
<li>The ability to prevent further use of the information collected
about the child and prevent any future collection of personal
information from the child.</li>
<li>The ability to access and review their child's personal
information.</li>
</ul>
COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can
collect from a child.
Web sites may not collect any more personal
information than is necessary to participate in a given game or
activity.
<p>For more information about COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's web site.</p>
<p>Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined Tagged
using a false age, please notify Tagged
at parentcare@tagged.com, and
we will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all
personally identifiable information displaying on the site.
If you would like to know more about our site, information
practices, stored information about your child, or how to close your
child's account, please contact Tagged by sending a letter to Tagged.com,
110 Pacific Ave Mall, Box #117, San Francisco, CA 94111 or by submitting
a request at help.tagged.com.
We will
happily respond to all letters from parents with Privacy questions or
concerns.</p>
User Information Collected by Tagged
Personally Identifiable User Information
<p>All users begin using Tagged's services by registering on the Tagged
website.
When registering, users provide personally identifiable
information, which includes their first and last name, email address,
zip code, a user-chosen password, and
date of birth, and other personal information.
To complete the
registration process, Tagged sends a validation email message to each
user, with a URL link back to our website.
This URL contains an
alphanumeric identifier and a user-specific numeric passcode that allows
us to confirm the user's identity.</p>
Cookies and Passive Data Collection
<p>Tagged logs standard user information and clickstream data for all
users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and page views.
When users visit particular pages within Tagged, a UserID may be placed
in the URL, allowing customized features for the user.
Users should be
aware that other websites visited before entering Tagged might place
personally identifiable information within a user's URL during a visit
to their website, and Tagged has no control over such websites.
Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a subsequent
website that collects URL information.
In addition to the standard log
information, Tagged uses a variety of technologies to create a more
personalized experience for its users.
Cookies are small data files sent
by websites to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the
computer to the website.
We use cookies to allow enhanced features, such
as allowing registered users to bypass typing their passwords before
entering the website.
We may also use cookies to enable customizable
content for users, as they become available.
Users have the option,
within their Internet browsers, to disable cookies and continue to
access the Tagged website.
Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are
included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages.
We use pixel tags to gather
information about the e-mails we send to our registered users.
When such
a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's
computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows
us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail
address, and other standard logging information.
The pixel tag also may
read cookies.
Tagged web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that
allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile
aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded
services as they become available.
Tagged pixel tags collect only a
limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a
page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides.
Tagged web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party
ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising.
We do not
have access to, nor control over, advertisers' cookies or how they may be
used.
If you would like more information about advertisers' use of cookies,
and about your option not to accept these cookies, please click

Document Retention Schedule

use of the Tagged website, including, without limitation, your name,
location, email address, pictures, friend connections, messages, comments,
login information, ip addresses and other data, will be stored by Tagged

How Tagged Uses the User Information
Personally Identifiable Information
<p>Tagged uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes
of the Tagged website, the Tagged referral and friend list building.
Personally identifiable information including members' pictures and
names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction on
Tagged.
Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new
friends to join Tagged and to add users to members' friends' networks.
To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the
service, Tagged allows users to search for other members using first and
last name, email address, location and schools where users may have
attended.
We also use email addresses to send useful information to all
registered users regarding the Tagged website.
For example, we provide
users with an opportunity to send their friends invitations to join Tagged.
The user can send such invitations either by entering the email address
of the referral or importing an address book and selecting the specific
email addresses that they would like to invite.
This results in an email
being sent from that registered user to the referral address, encouraging
the referral to sign up on the Tagged website.
If the referred person does not sign up within a few days, we may
also send a reminder from the registered user to the referral address.
All registered users will be able to view other users Stats, Profiles, Public
Journals and friend list pages, which may include personal information
and responses to survey questions.
From time to time, Tagged may share the email address and/or other
personally identifiable information of any registered user with third
parties for marketing purposes.
In addition, Tagged may share a
registered user's email address with third parties to target advertising
and to improve user experience on Tagged's pages in general.</p>
Cookies and Passive Data Collection
<p>Tagged uses cookie, IP address, clickstream and URL information to
improve the content of the Tagged website, the quality of Tagged
servers, and to provide enhanced features to users, where available.
We
use cookies to save UserIDs, session validators, and on users' browsers
and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products or
services to those users, as they become available.
We also cross-match
user information with information collected from cookies and clickstream
data in order to test features of the Tagged website, and to better
personalize our various offerings for users.
IP Addresses also help us
to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Tagged site, and
to otherwise provide the Tagged service to its users.
IP addresses may
be disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law
or legal process so requires, or to protect the rights or property of
Tagged or others.
From time to time we may extend various offers from
various partner companies, including news or additional details on
products and services.
A user's usage history may result in specifically
tailored special offer screens or products.

aggregate reports for advertisers.
For example, we may report to

users that visited different portions of the Tagged website.
