<p>For customers based in the United States, when you visit this website, whether or not you are logged in or enter any personal information, our web server automatically collects anonymous information such as log data and IP addresses, and may collect general information concerning your location.
For European Union customers, such information is collected once your consent is provided.
We may use this collected information for a number of purposes, such as improving our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.</p>
<p>When you visit one of our stores or shop via the NM mobile app, we may also automatically collect information about your geo-location based, in part, upon which wireless network has been accessed.
When this happens we attempt to de-identify the information, which means that we remove or change (e.g., hash) certain pieces of information that might be used to link the data to you, or to your device.
We will not attempt to re-identify geo-location information (i.e., link it to you or your device) unless you affirmatively give us permission to collect geo-location information about you.
If you give us such permission, you can later decide to opt-out.
To disable geo-location on your mobile device, open your Settings app, and tap Privacy.
Then, tap on Location Services.
Scroll down until you see the "NM" app and tap on the toggle on the right hand side so that the toggle is no longer green.</p>
<p>Our mobile applications will not transmit geo-location information about you to us unless you give them permission to do so.</p>
<p>Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online.
At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.</p>

<li> Security Against Fraud <p>It should come as no surprise that one of our highest priorities at The Neiman Marcus Group is keeping your personal information secure and confidential.
To that end, we would like to share some of the most common types of internet scams and suggestions on how you can be aware of and help protect yourself against identity theft.</p> Fictitious Job Offer Emails Alert <p>Email campaigns offering fictitious job offers are a reality.
The emails can be quite authentic looking.
They often purport to have been sent directly from one of our executives or from our human resources department.
Enclosures, such as company information sheets and detailed questionnaires, may display The Neiman Marcus Group logo or the logo of one of our divisions (Neiman Marcus, Horchow, Cusp, Last Call, or Bergdorf Goodman).
The emails may include a request for payment of a processing fee of several hundred dollars, and/or they may offer reimbursement for certain job-application or relocation expenses.</p>
<p>These emails are fraudulent.
The Neiman Marcus Group does not extend job offers via email to individuals with whom it has had no prior contact.
We do not ask prospective employees to pay a fee to be considered for a position or to receive a job offer.
We do not authorize recruiters or agents to do any of these things on our behalf.
Fraudulent job offers are an unfortunate possibility.
Please be aware, as we will not honor them in any way.</p>
<p>You should not respond to any of these job offers by revealing personal information, nor should you send any funds in response to them.
If you receive one of these fraudulent offers, please report the matter to the U.S.
Secret Service.
You may also email our security group.</p> Phishing and Spoofing Alert <p>This is when a criminal sends you a phony message or a website link that appears to be from a legitimate business.
They will directly request that you provide personal financial information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and address</li>
<li>Social Security numbers</li>
<li>Credit card numbers/bank account numbers</li>
<li>PIN numbers/passwords</li>
</ul>
<br>Pop-Up Advertisements Alert <p>Some advertisements "pop up" in a separate browser window advising that you have won a contest or request that you participate in a survey to collect a prize.
They may then ask that you provide personal information in order to receive your gift.
By clicking on the link it is possible that you are also downloading viruses designed to capture or destroy information on your computer.</p> Check Scam Alert <p>A similar but low-tech scam circulates occasionally, in the form of a check, purportedly from The Neiman Marcus Group or one of our divisions, and instructions to deposit it right away, usually in order to receive the balance of a larger sum you have "won" or that has otherwise come to you unexpectedly.
You will be instructed to immediately send a payment, in the form of a second personal check, wire transfer, or similar, to some third party to cover taxes, processing fees, administrative costs, or some similarly vague expense.
The check you receive in the mail likely would look quite authentic and probably would have our Neiman Marcus Group trademark on it.
Do not deposit the check or follow the instructions you receive with it.
The check you deposit will bounce.
the check you write or funds you wire will clear, before you know about the bounce, and certainly before you can stop payment on your own check.</p> Important Risk-Reducing Tips <ul>
<li>Never respond to emails that cannot be verified.</li>
<li>Never provide personal information via email.</li>
<li>Contact the business by using legitimate phone numbers to verify the request.</li>
<li>Enter websites using your browser and not by clicking on provided links.</li>
<li>Be cautious of any solicitation requesting that you deposit a check or pay a fee to collect a prize, get a job, or cover vaguely described "costs".</li>
<li>Consider filing a report with the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorney general's consumer protection office, or the FBI.
Online complaints may be filed with the FTC at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov, and white collar crimes may be reported to the FBI at www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aslix.</li>
