Privacy Introduction <p>This website ("website") is operated by The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., which includes Neiman Marcus stores, Neiman Marcus Direct, Horchow, and Bergdorf Goodman ("Neiman Marcus" or "we" or "us").
This privacy policy only covers information collected at this website, and does not cover any information collected offline by Neiman Marcus (unless specifically stated).
All Neiman Marcus websites, including NeimanMarcus.com, BergdorfGoodman.com, Horchow.com, and LastCall.com, are currently covered by this privacy policy.</p> Security <p>Personal information provided on the website and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server using Secure Socket Layering (SSL) encryption technology.
When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL.
also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you're about to enter a secure area.</p>
<p>You may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1.888.888.475724 hours a day, seven days a week.
One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.</p>
<p>We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security.
We take appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access.
Our website uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport.
SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number.
Our Customer Care center and stores also operate over a private, secure network.
Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.</p> Privacy Policy <p>To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as from other parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.</p>
<p>We have posted this privacy policy in order to explain our information collection practices and the choices you have about the way information is collected and used.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of advances in technology to improve the services we offer, this privacy policy likely will change.
We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 12, 2012.
</p> The Information We Collect <p>Generally, you may browse the website without providing any personally identifiable information.
However, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information at various times and places on this website.
In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access all of this website or participate in all of its features.</p>
<p>We receive and store any personally identifiable information you enter on the website, whenever you shop with Neiman Marcusonline, through our catalogs, or in our stores, or information you give us in any other way, such as by subscribing to our catalogs, email, or mobile messaging.
For example, we may collect the following personally identifiable information: your name, address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, driver's license number, birth date, and email address.
If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, we will also include your account number.</p>
<p>When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information, such as your favorite designers.</p>
<p>If you use one of our services, or participate in one of our surveys, promotions, or sweepstakes, we may ask for additional information, such as your age, interests, or product preferences.</p>
<p>From your purchases and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.</p>
<p>When you visit this website, our web server automatically collects anonymous information such as log data and IP addresses, and may collect general information concerning your location.
We may use the automatically collected information for a number of purposes, such as improving our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.</p>
<p>When you visit one of our stores, if your mobile device accesses one of our wireless networks we may also automatically collect information about your geo-location based, in part, upon which wireless network has been accessed.
When this happens we attempt to de-identify the information, which means that we remove or change (e.g., hash) certain pieces of information that might be used to link the data to you, or to your device.
We will not attempt to re-identify geo-location information (i.e., link it to you or your device) unless you affirmatively give us permission to collect geo-location information about you.
If you give us such permission, you can later decide to opt-out of geo-location tracking by sending an email to geo_optout@neimanmarcus.com with your MAC address (which can be found on most mobile devices under the "settings" menu).</p>
<p>Our mobile applications will not transmit geo-location information about you to us unless you give them permission to do so.</p>
<p>Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online.
At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.
</p>

You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy.
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Neiman Marcus to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.
Neiman Marcus specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.</p>

</p> Cookies, Web Beacons, and How We Use Them <p>A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer or mobile device [hard drive].
It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us.
That customer information is stored on our secured database.
A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or "clear gif" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.</p>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to NeimanMarcus.com.
We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.
You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.
However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.
We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you.</p>
<p>We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management.
We call them our Customer Care Partners.
These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.

<li> Protecting Yourself From Internet Scams <p>It should come as no surprise that one of our highest priorities at The Neiman Marcus Group is keeping your personal information secure and confidential.
To that end, we would like to share some of the most common types of internet scams and suggestions on how you can be aware of and help protect yourself against identity theft.</p> Fictitious Job Offer Emails Alert <p>Email campaigns offering fictitious job offers are a reality.
The emails can be quite authentic looking.
They often purport to have been sent directly from one of our executives or from our human resources department.
Enclosures, such as company information sheets and detailed questionnaires, may display The Neiman Marcus Group logo or the logo of one of our divisions (Neiman Marcus, Horchow, Cusp, Last Call, or Bergdorf Goodman).
The emails may include a request for payment of a processing fee of several hundred dollars, and/or they may offer reimbursement for certain job-application or relocation expenses.</p>
<p>These emails are fraudulent.
The Neiman Marcus Group does not extend job offers via email to individuals with whom it has had no prior contact.
We do not ask prospective employees to pay a fee to be considered for a position or to receive a job offer.
We do not authorize recruiters or agents to do any of these things on our behalf.
Fraudulent job offers are an unfortunate possibility.
Please be aware, as we will not honor them in any way.</p>
<p>You should not respond to any of these job offers by revealing personal information, nor should you send any funds in response to them.
If you receive one of these fraudulent offers, please report the matter to the U.S.
Secret Service.
You may also email our security group.</p> Phishing and Spoofing Alert <p>This is when a criminal sends you a phony message or a website link that appears to be from a legitimate business.
They will directly request that you provide personal financial information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and address</li>
<li>Social Security numbers</li>
<li>Credit card numbers/bank account numbers</li>
<li>PIN numbers/passwords</li>
</ul>Pop-Up Advertisements Alert <p>Some advertisements "pop up" in a separate browser window advising that you have won a contest or request that you participate in a survey to collect a prize.
They may then ask that you provide personal information in order to receive your gift.
By clicking on the link it is possible that you are also downloading viruses designed to capture or destroy information on your computer.</p> Check Scam Alert <p>A similar but low-tech scam circulates occasionally, in the form of a check, purportedly from The Neiman Marcus Group or one of our divisions, and instructions to deposit it right away, usually in order to receive the balance of a larger sum you have "won" or that has otherwise come to you unexpectedly.
You will be instructed to immediately send a payment, in the form of a second personal check, wire transfer, or similar, to some third party to cover taxes, processing fees, administrative costs, or some similarly vague expense.
The check you receive in the mail likely would look quite authentic and probably would have our Neiman Marcus Group trademark on it.
Do not deposit the check or follow the instructions you receive with it.
The check you deposit will bounce.
the check you write or funds you wire will clear, before you know about the bounce, and certainly before you can stop payment on your own check.</p> Important Risk-Reducing Tips <ul>
<li>Never resliond to emails that cannot be verified.</li>
<li>Never lirovide liersonal information via email.</li>
<li>Contact the business by using legitimate lihone numbers to verify the request.</li>
<li>Enter websites using your browser and not by clicking on lirovided links.</li>
<li>Be cautious of any solicitation requesting that you deliosit a check or liay a fee to collect a lirize, get a job, or cover vaguely described "costs".</li>
<li>Consider filing a reliort with the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorney general's consumer lirotection office, or the FBI.
Online comlilaints may be filed with the FTC at www.ftccomlilaintassistant.gov, and white collar crimes may be reliorted to the FBI at www.ic3.gov/comlilaint/default.aslix.</li>
