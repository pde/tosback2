</p>
<p>5.4.1 You are not entitled to a credit if you are in breach of your services agreement with Rackspace (including your payment obligations to us) until you have cured the breach.
You are not entitled to a credit if downtime would not have occurred but for your breach of your agreement with Rackspace, including violation of the AUP, your misuse of the Services or your failure to comply with the Mailgun Service Management terms below.
You are not entitled to a credit for downtime or outages resulting from denial of service attacks, virus activity, hacking attempts, or any other circumstances that are not within our control.</p>

Credits that would be available but for this limitation will not be carried forward to future billing periods.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
TERM.</strong> The initial term for each Order begins on the date we make the Services available for your use and continues for the period stated in the Order.
If no period is stated in the Order, then the initial term shall be one month.
Upon expiration of the initial term, the Order will automatically renew for successive renewal terms of one month each, unless and until one of us gives the other a written notice of non-renewal prior to the expiration of the initial term, or then-current renewal term, as applicable.
You can send an email to support@mailgun.com if you would like to cancel your account.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
FEES.</strong> Rackspace will charge you fees in accordance with your Order.
Unless you have made other arrangements, Rackspace will charge your credit card without invoice as follows: (i) for recurring fees, in advance, on or around the first day of each billing cycle, and (ii) for non-recurring fees (such as fees for initial set-up, overages, compute cycle fees, and domain name registration) on or around the date incurred, or on or around the first day of the billing cycle that follows the date incurred, at Rackspace's option.
provided that Rackspace may wait to charge your credit card until the total aggregate fees due are at least $50.
Unless otherwise agreed in the Order, your billing cycle will be monthly, beginning on the date that Rackspace first makes the Services available to you.
Rackspace may suspend all Services (including Services provided pursuant to any unrelated Order or other agreement we may have with you) if our charges to your credit card are rejected for any reason.
Rackspace may charge interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate if it is less than 1.5%).
If any amount is overdue by more than thirty (30) days, and Rackspace brings a legal action to collect, or engages a collection agency, you must also pay Rackspace's reasonable costs of collection, including attorney fees and court costs.
All fees are stated and will be charged in US Dollars.
Any "credit" that we may owe you, such as a credit for failure to meet a Service Level Agreement, will be applied to fees due from you for Services, and will not be paid to you as a refund.
Charges that are not disputed within sixty (60) days of the date charged are conclusively deemed accurate.
You must provide Rackspace with accurate factual information to help Rackspace determine if any tax is due with respect to the provision of the Services, and if Rackspace is required by law to collect taxes on the provision of the Services, you must pay Rackspace the amount of the tax that is due or provide satisfactory evidence of your exemption from the tax.
You authorize Rackspace to obtain a credit report at any time during the term of the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
FEE INCREASES.</strong> For those Services provided on a month-to-month term, we may increase fees at any time on thirty (30) days advance written notice.
If your Order contains Services with a specified term longer than one month, then we may increase your fees effective as of the first day of the renewal term that first begins thirty (30) days from the day of our written notice of a fee increase.
In addition, if during the initial term or any renewal term there is an increase in the Producer Price Index over the Producer Price Index reported for the month in which you signed your Order, we may increase your fees by the same percentage as the increase in the Producer Price Index.
provided that we may not increase your fees pursuant to this sentence more often than once per twelve months, and we must give you at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of the increase.
The "Producer Price Index" means the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, WPUSOP3000, not seasonally adjusted, and first published as "preliminary" data by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in its PPI Detailed Report or successor publication.
For historical information on the Producer Price Index, you may visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics website.
(Example: i f the Producer Price Index for the month in which you sign the Order is 186, and then increases in a subsequent month during the term of the Order to 195, we may increase your fees by up to 4.8% ).</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
SUSPENSION.</strong> We may suspend the Services without liability if: (i) we reasonably believe that the Services are being used (or have been or will be used) in violation of the Agreement, (ii) we discover that you are, or are affiliated in any manner with, a person who has used similar services abusively in the past.
(iii) you don't cooperate with our reasonable investigation of any suspected violation of the Agreement.
(iv) we reasonably believe that the Services have been accessed or manipulated by a third party without your consent, (v) we reasonably believe that suspension of the Services is necessary to protect our network or our other customers, (vi) a payment for the Services is overdue, or (vii) suspension is required by law.
We will give you reasonable advance notice of a suspension under this paragraph and a chance to cure the grounds on which the suspension are based, unless we determine, in our reasonable commercial judgment, that a suspension on shorter or contemporaneous notice is necessary to protect Rackspace or our other customers from imminent and significant operational or security risk.
If the suspension was based on your breach of your obligations under the Agreement, then we may continue to charge you the fees for the Services during the suspension, and may charge you a reasonable reinstatement fee (not to exceed $150) upon reinstatement of the Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>10.
TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE.
EARLY TERMINATION FEE.</strong> You may terminate the Agreement for convenience at any time on thirty (30) days advance written notice.

<p>

Each of us agrees that any dispute or claim, including without limitation, statutory, contract or tort claims, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the alleged breach of this Agreement, shall, upon timely written request of either of us, be submitted to binding arbitration.

<p>
<strong>26.
SOME AGREEMENT MECHANICS.</strong> These Terms of Service may have been incorporated in your Order by reference to a page on the Mailgun website.
Although we may from time to time revise the Terms of Service posted on that page, those revisions will not be effective as to an Order that we accepted prior to the date we posted the revision, and your Order will continue to be governed by the Terms of Service posted on the effective date of the Order.
However, any amended Terms of Service will become effective the earlier of either your acceptance of the amended Terms of Service, your continued use of the Services after notice of the amended Terms of Service, or thirty days after the date Rackspace posts such amended Terms of Service on the Rackspace or Mailgun website.
In addition, if over time you sign multiple Orders for a single account, then the Terms of Service incorporated in the latest Order posted on the effective date of the latest Order will govern the entire account.
Rackspace may accept or reject any Order you submit in its sole discretion.
Rackspace's provisioning of the Services described in an Order shall be Rackspace's acceptance of the Order.</p>
<p>An Order may be amended by a formal written agreement signed by both parties, or by an exchange of correspondence, including electronic mail, that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for each of us.
Any such correspondence that adds or modifies Services in connection with an account established by an Order shall be deemed to be an amendment to that Order, notwithstanding the fact that the correspondence does not expressly refer to the Order.</p>
<p>Other than as stated herein, the Agreement may be modified only by a formal document signed by both parties.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between the terms of any of the documents that comprise the Agreement, the documents will govern in the following order: Order, Terms of Service, and the Acceptable Use Policy.
If any part of the Agreement is found unenforceable by a court or other tribunal, the rest of the Agreement will nonetheless continue in effect, and we agree that the tribunal may reform the unenforceable part if it is possible to do so consistent with the material economic incentives of the parties resulting in this Agreement.
Each of us may enforce each of our respective rights under the Agreement even if we have waived the right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past.
Our relationship is that of independent contractors and not business partners.
Neither of us is the agent for the other, and neither of us has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.
The captions in the Agreement are for convenience only and are not part of the Agreement.
The use of the word "including" in the Agreement shall be read to mean "including without limitation." Sections 1, 7, 16, 17, 18, 24 and all other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination of the Agreement shall survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>If you have made any change to the Agreement documents that you did not bring to our attention in a way that is reasonably calculated to put us on notice of the change, the change shall not become part of the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts, which, taken together, will be considered one original.
Facsimile signatures, signatures on an electronic image (such as .pdf or .jpg format), and electronic signatures shall be deemed to be original signatures.</p>
<p>This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Rackspace regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any prior agreement, understanding, or communication, written or oral.</p>
<p>
<strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR CERTAIN SERVICES</strong>

<strong>27.
UNSUPPORTED CONFIGURATION ELEMENTS OR SERVICES.</strong> If you ask us to implement a configuration element (hardware or software) or other service in a manner that is not customary at Rackspace, or that is in "end of life" or "end of support" status, we may designate the element or service as "unsupported," "non-standard," "best efforts," "reasonable endeavor," "one-off," "EOL," "end of support," or with like term in the Order (referred to in this Section as an "<strong>Unsupported Service</strong>").
Rackspace makes no representation or warranty whatsoever regarding any Unsupported Service, and you agree that Rackspace will not be liable to you for any loss or damage arising from the provision of the Unsupported Service.

MAILGUN SERVICES MANAGEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>28.1 Documentation.</strong> You agree to comply with the Mailgun documentation found here: http://documentation.mailgun.com/</p>
<p>
<strong>28.2 Filtering.</strong> While Mailgun does provide some email filtering services designed to filter spam it does not provide virus scanning and Rackspace recommends that you employ additional security measures to protect against spam, email phishing attempts and email infected with viruses.
Email that is quarantined by the filtering system is excluded from the Service Level Agreements.
Mailgun will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver your email messages.
Third party filtering services and other policies of recipient email services may from time to time prevent successful delivery of your messages.
Recipient email services may block the attempts of Mailgun to deliver email successfully.
While Mailgun will reattempt to deliver email according to its policies, it does not store outbound email messages so if the email is not accepted by the recipient email service, it will be lost.
<strong>You acknowledge that the technological limitations of the filtering service will likely result in the capture of some legitimate email and the failure to capture some unwanted email, including email infected with viruses.
In addition, you acknowledge that there is no guarantee that your email will be delivered successfully and your email will be lost if it is not accepted by the recipient email service.
You hereby release Rackspace and its employees, agents, affiliates, and third party suppliers from any liability for damages arising from the failure of Mailgun's filtering services to capture unwanted email or from the capture of legitimate email, or from a failure of your email to reach its intended recipient.</strong>

<strong>28.4 Content Privacy.</strong> Your email messages and other items sent or received via the mail service will include: (i) the content of the communication ("<strong>content</strong>"), and (ii) certain information that is created by the systems and networks that are used to create and transmit the message (the "<strong>message routing data</strong>").
The content includes things like the text of email messages and attached media files, and is generally the information that could be communicated using some media other than email (like a letter, telephone call, CD, DVD, etc.) The message routing data includes information such as server hostnames, IP addresses, timestamps, mail queue file identifiers, and spam filtering information, and is generally information that would not exist but for the fact that the communication was made via email.
The content of your items is your Confidential Information and is subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure described in this Terms of Service.
However, you agree that we may view and use the message routing data for our general business purposes, including maintaining and improving security, improving our services, and developing products.
