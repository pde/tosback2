<br>Monster.s Privacy Commitment .
Overview<br> Monster is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.
We want to provide a safe, secure user experience.
The following statement explains Monster's commitment to managing your personal information and sets out how and when personal information is collected, held, used or disclosed.
This Privacy Commitment only applies to data gathered on the Monster web site (the "Web Site"), and does not apply to any other information or web site.<br>
<br>
The information we gather on the Web Site may be shared with any of the Monster-affiliated companies on a worldwide basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer to employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling of our registered users.
In this Privacy Commitment, "affiliated companies" shall mean entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Monster, Inc.<br>
<br>
The Web Site contains links to other web sites over which we have no control.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites to which you choose to link from our Web Site.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so that you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.
<br>
<br>
<br>Information About All Monster Visitors<br>
We gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most.
We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate.
This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.
We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Monster visitors use our Web Site, and also create a better overall experience for you.
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Monster to any outside parties, except when to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or in legal proceedings when such information is relevant.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive information about you such as information about your membership in a professional or trade association or trade union.<br>
<br>
We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the Web Site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible Web Site experience.
When you grant us your permission, we will communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey information on using the Monster Web Site to maximise your career development.

If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your My Monster account and edit your account profile.<br>
<br>
If you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Monster and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information will be collected, used and becomes the property of both Monster and the partner co-sponsoring the contest.
In that instance, Monster is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives or how it is used.<br>
<br>

<br>
There are two ways of doing this:<ol>
<li>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters.

 </li>
<li>You can allow your resume to be searchable by employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals who pay for access to our resume database and your resume.
When you opt to make your resume searchable, you still have the choice to make your personal details confidential where all of your contact information and even your current place of employment can remain hidden.
We use our best efforts to restrict access to our database only to those who have paid for access.
these parties may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that parties other than those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain access to this database.
However Monster is not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties.
