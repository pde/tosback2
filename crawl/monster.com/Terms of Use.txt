<p>The Monster Sites act as, among other things, venues for (i) employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to post resumes and Profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities.
Monster does not screen or censor the listings, including Profiles offered.
Monster is not involved in, and does not control, the actual transaction between employers and candidates.
As a result, Monster is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and Monster makes no representations about any jobs, resumes or User Content on the Monster Sites.
While Monster reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, resumes or other material from the Monster Sites from time to time, Monster does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.</p>
<p>Monster Networking provides a venue for individuals to network for professional and personal purposes and Monster does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on the Monster Sites.
Monster is not involved in the actual communications between Users.
As a result, Monster has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the Monster Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on the Monster Sites.</p>

By its very nature other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.

<p>Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, Monster cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be.
Because we do not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on any Monster Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release Monster (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>The Monster Sites and the Monster Content may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors.
Monster makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any Monster Site or the Monster Content.
The use of all Monster Sites and the Monster Content is at Your own risk.
Changes are periodically made to Monster Sites and may be made at any time.
Monster cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use of any Monster Site.
No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a User from Monster or through or from any Monster Site shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein.</p>
<p>If You are a California resident, You waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>
<p>Monster encourages You to keep a back-up copy of any of Your User Content.
To the extent permitted by law, in no event shall Monster be liable for the deletion, loss, or unauthorized modification of any User Content.</p>
