<br>4.1.2 Information Shared via Third Party Features<br>
<p>Scribd may offer additional features that allow you to share your information with a Third Party (like Waze).
If you tell us to do so, Scribd will share limited amounts of information with the Third Party in order to enable the feature you choose.
We will tell you what information the Third Party may receive when you initially instruct us to share it.
Please be aware that any information you provide to a Third Party will be subject to that Third Party’s privacy policy.</p>
<br>
<p>Scribd will share your information for as long as you use the Third Party feature.
You can disable this at any time in your Scribd settings under Settings.</p>

<br>
<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity.  In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<br>4.1.5 Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions<br>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).  Should such an event occur, Scribd will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>4.2 Data Transfers<br>

Although Scribd makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Scribd is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary.  If Scribd determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries.
To protect your privacy, Scribd will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>

<br>7.0 Security<br>
<p>The security of all Personal Information provided to Scribd is important to us, and Scribd takes reasonable steps designed to protect your Personal Information.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
