<p>We will use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g.
Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you.
You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g.
to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).</p>
<p>It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection.
When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your name, photo, network and contact information.

You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.</p>
<p>Visitors have choices about how we use their data.</p>Stay Informed<p>Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect.
Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones.

</ul>
<p>We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled “ads” or “sponsored.” If you take an action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser.

(ii) with your separate permission (e.g., lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g.
profile).
However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our site or apps, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may through the use of mechanisms such as cookies determine it is you.
Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies.
In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.</p>2.5 Marketing<p>We promote our Services to you and others.</p>

We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas.
In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy.

<p>We use your data (including your communications) if we think it’s necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy and/or attempts to harm our Members or Visitors.</p>3.
How We Share Information3.1 Our Services<p>Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g.
likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others.</p>Profile<p>Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services.
Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines).
As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.</p>Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages<p>Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings).
Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).</li>
<li>In a group, posts are visible to others in the group.
Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings.</li>
<li>Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.</li>
<li>When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.</li>
<li>We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.</li>
<li>Subject to your settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile.</li>
<li>When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g.
as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information.
We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.</p>Enterprise Accounts<p>Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager.
Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.</p>
<p>Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services.
For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity.
We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).</p>3.2 Communication Archival<p>Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.</p>
<p>Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services.
We enable archiving of messages by those Members outside of our Services.
For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.</p>3.3 Others’ Services<p>You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or start conversations with your connections on such platforms.
Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, other services may look-up your profile.
When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them.
The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts.
For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service.
You may revoke the link with such accounts.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user a “mini” LinkedIn profile of the person they are meeting or messaging, <dfn>social media aggregators</dfn>For example, company page administrators may manage their brand's online presence by aggregating users' comments and other social actions across social networks and see their basic profiles in that context., talent and lead managers).
“Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.</p>3.4 Related Services<p>We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn-affiliated entities.</p>
<p>We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services.
We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others.
For example, SlideShare will recommend better content to you based on your LinkedIn profile or the articles you read on the LinkedIn Services, and we can personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning video history, because we are able to identify you across different Services using cookies or similar technologies.</p>3.5 Service Providers<p>We may use others to help us with our Services.</p>
<p>We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development).
They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>3.6 Legal Disclosures<p>We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.</p>
<p>It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies.
(2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats).
or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others.
We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency.
We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report.</p>3.7 Change in Control or Sale<p>We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events.
Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</p>4.
