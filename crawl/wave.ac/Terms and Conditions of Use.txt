User Guidelines<p>To make wave.ac an accessible and safe service, we have certain expectations pertaining to the use of our service.
These expectations are outlined categorically for your consideration:</p>7.1.
Handling of Account, Content, and Data<p>To make wave.ac an accessible and safe service, we have certain expectations for our users.
Some are more common sense than others, but all are equally important.</p>
<p>The first of these expectations is to keep your account and data safe.
You mustn’t provide your password to any other person or individual, or use any other person’s username or password for that matter.
We will not be held responsible for actions made on your account, even if you allege that they were done by another individual.
For this matter, your account and sign in IS an extension of you, and you will bare the consequences for any action committed on that account—including if any charges or claims are brought to us against you (see: 5.1 Liability for Content).</p>
<p>The second of these core expectations is that you keep your material appropriate and free from malicious material.
We will not tolerate offensive, abusive, pornographic, threatening, or obscene User Content.
This includes comments, audio files, usernames, profile photos, banners, and any aspect of the site which includes the option to add or modify User Content.
In the same regard, we will not allow you to upload or share any malicious content like malware, Trojan horses, viruses, or other files which could hurt the integrity of the service or damage other users.
Furthermore, content which is intended to promote or commit an illegal act of any kind, or intended to damage or bully another individual or group of people, is not acceptable.
These damages extend in regards to intellectual property and copyrights (see: 7.4 Intellectual Property).</p>
<p>Finally, we expect that your engagements on the site do not conflict with our Agreements.
You mustn’t sell user accounts, playlists, or accept compensation to influence the name of an account, playlist, or any content.</p>7.2.
Spam or Automated Activities<p>wave.ac considers the use of automated activity and botting plays, follows, messages, likes, or other activities and forms of User Content on our site to be a terminable offense.
This is an unacceptable practice and have no tolerance for it.
Should we find that your account, or multiple accounts you own, are engaging in automated, spam, or deceptive activity, we reserve the right to completely delete your account--and any associated accounts, as permissible by law.
We will not refund any balances or associated finances with involved accounts.</p>7.3.
COPPA<p>Because of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we require all of our users to be at least 13 years old.
If you are between the age of 13 and 17, these Terms and our applicable Agreements must be agreed to by your parents or guardian in order for you to make use of the service.
Do observe that if you are between the age of 13 and 17 and sign up for our service, we will take this to mean that you have received the necessary and proper permissions from your parent or guardian.</p>7.4.
Intellectual Property<p>wave.ac considers the intellectual property of creators to be of utmost importance.
For this reason, we expect that all users take intellectual property—and specifically copyright—seriously.
We expect that all creators have the right or necessary permissions to upload, share, and distribute their content on wave.ac.
This expectation of permissions or rights to upload or share content extends upon audio posts, comments, images, trademarks, and all aspects of User Content.
Infringing on the intellectual property rights (or copyrights) of creators—whether they’re users of our platform or not—is not just wrong, but illegal.</p>
<p>Since we hold the intellectual property of other creators in high esteem, we expect them to do the same in regards to the intellectual property of wave.ac.
You mustn’t infringe on the intellectual property rights (or copyrights) of wave.ac or any of its users.
remove copyright, trademark, or notices of intellectual property on our Service.
or make use of our Branding to disguise or mislead individuals on the ownership or source of content.
Furthermore, we expect that you will not circumvent any technology which protects wave.ac’s Content or Service, or circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works based on the wave.ac Service, our Content, or any part thereof unless permitted by applicable laws.
Finally, we expect that you respect our rights by not selling, renting, or sublicensing any part of our Service or Content.</p>
<p>We take Intellectual Property extremely seriously, and we expect that you will too.
If you engage in behaviors which violate our expectations for intellectual property, we might delete your account or disable your ability to upload and interact with content—permanently, and without warning.
You acknowledge and agree that posting any User Content may result in termination or suspension of your account.
You also agree that we may reclaim your username for any reason.
For this reason, we hope you are cognizant and considerate of what you post.</p>7.4.1.
Reporting Copyright Infringement<p>Per our policy of taking Intellectual Property seriously, it should be no surprise that we are fully compliant with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
As noted, wave.ac is a hosting service and our users are solely liable for the material they post to our site.
That said, if you allege that your copyright or intellectual property rights have been violated by any User Content, you can file a DMCA takedown request here.</p>7.4.2.
Three Strike System<p>Users who are acquainted with the strike system on other content sites might be familiar with the idea of “three strike” systems.
wave.ac utilizes a three strike system for DMCA takedown requests, but we execute the strikes differently than other sites.</p>
<p>On wave.ac, should we receive a DMCA takedown that alleges you have infringed on a user’s content, we will inform you of the takedown and pull your content.
We will give you, the user, a 48 hour period in which you can respond and dispute the takedown.
If you choose during that time to dispute the DMCA takedown, we will restore the content and you will not receive a strike.
If you choose during that time not to dispute the DMCA takedown, or have accepted that you did infringe on someone else’s contract, you will receive a strike.</p>
<p>As the title assumes, you can only receive three strikes.
A strike expires 6 months after the filing.
If you reach your third strike, your account might be disabled or closed.</p>
<p>If you create additional accounts on wave.ac and continue getting strikes, you will be categorized as a “Repeat Infringer” and might have your email or IP banned rather than individual accounts.
While we don’t assume this will happen for most users, because most users will never receive a DMCA takedown, we do understand that repeat infringers are out there.
For that reason, we’re making it abundantly clear that we have policy in place to prevent consistent infringers from having a platform to continue infringing.</p>8.
Brand, Label, and Company Accounts<p>We understand that some users of wave.ac will make accounts on behalf of their Brand, Label, or Company (these accounts are collectively referred to as “Brand Accounts”).
This is fine, and acceptable, but should you choose to make a Brand Account, the terms “you” and “your”, as used throughout our Agreements, apply to both you, other users of the account, and the Brand, as applicable.</p>
<p>Opening a Brand Account means that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses necessary to be compliant and binding with the terms in these Agreements.</p>8.1.
Communication with Users<p>Brands should only follow Brands or individuals they have independently endorsed, and users who first follow the Brand.
Brands may only send messages to users who first send them messages, except in cases relating to our Industry Community--where a user has indicated interest in being contacted by Brands.
Furthermore, Brands should not imply an endorsement or relationship between other Brands, any artists, or any other party unless the Brand has obtained those rights to imply said endorsement independently.</p>9.
Customer Support<p>Should you require support with your account, payments, or any other aspect of our Service, you can submit a ticket to wave.ac for Support.
We will try our best to respond to all inquiries and tickets in a reasonable manner, but we cannot guarantee that inquiries will be responded to in any particular time frame and/or those answers will be satisfactory to the inquirer.</p>10.
Term and Termination<p>These Agreements will apply to you until terminated by either you or wave.ac.
However, you acknowledge that the license granted to us by you in relation to User Content is irrevocable and will continue after expiry or termination of any of these Agreements for any reason.</p>
<p>wave.ac may choose to suspend the Agreements, or your access to the Service, at any time.
If we suspend access to the Service, you agree that wave.ac shall have no liability or responsibility to you.
Furthermore, we will not refund any amounts or balances already paid to us, as allowed by permissible law.
This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.</p>
<p>You may choose to terminate your Agreements at any time by contacting us and closing your account.
However, even after termination of the Agreements, Section 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14 must remain in effect and shall, even if you choose to terminate the Agreements..</p>11.

WITH THIS ACKNOWLEDGED, YOUR USE OF THE WAVE.AC SERVICE AND ECOSYSTEM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” ON OUR WEBSITE, APPS, AND ALL APPLICABLE MEDIUMS.
IF ANY BUGS, DOWNTIME, TECHNICAL, OR SECURITY ISSUES ARE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, WE WILL TRY TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO RESOLVE ALL DEFECTS RELATING TO OUR SERVICE AND ITS APPLICABLE PARTS.
HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PROMISE THEIR TOTAL RESOLUTION.
IN ADDITION, WE WILL NOT REPRESENT OR GUARANTEE THAT ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITE, APPS, AND/OR ANY OTHER PART(S) OF OUR SERVICE WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, OR FUNCTIONAL.
AS AN EXTENSION OF THIS, WE CANNOT REPRESENT, PROMISE, OR GUARANTEE THAT ANY ASPECT OF OUR SERVICE WILL BE PERSISTENTLY EFFECTIVE IN ANY AND ALL CASES.</p>
<p>WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL FOREGOING WARRANTIES AND OTHER WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE AGREEMENTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF FOREGOING WARRANTIES INCLUDES ANY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED LIMITATIONS DEALING WITH OUR COMPANY OR SERVICE’S MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR USAGE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF OUR SITE.
FURTHERMORE, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION THAT SHOULD ARISE THROUGH USE OF WAVE.AC’S SERVICE OR ECOSYSTEM IS TO UNINSTALL OUR SOFTWARE AND TO STOP USE OF OUR SERVICE.</p>
<p>IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE LAWS LIMIT OR PROHIBIT THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AS AFOREMENTIONED, OUR DISCLAIMERS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW OF SUCH JURISDICTION APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>12.
Indemnity<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold wave.ac harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) that should arise from: (1) your breach of this Agreement.
(2) any User Content.
(3) any activity or actions you engage in on the Service.
and (4) your violation of law or rights using our platform or any of its third parties.</p>13.
Choice of Law<p>We understand that lots of users from around the world use our service.
However, in applying our Agreement, we cannot make this process simple if it means binding our Agreement to a different jurisdiction’s law based on the user’s geographical location.
Therefore, you agree that this Agreement is subject solely to and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws applicable in the State of Virginia, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
Furthermore, you and wave.ac agree to the jurisdiction of the City of Norfolk, Virginia to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy which arises from the Agreements.</p>14.
Dispute Resolution<p>In resolving any and all disputes, we ask users to engage us directly about any controversy, allegation, or claim which arises out of or relates to the Site, the Service, User Content, these terms, or any of the Agreements (collectively, a “Dispute”).
We also ask users to engage us about any controversy, allegation, or claim which arises out of wave.ac’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an “Excluded Dispute”).
We ask the user to contact us, involving a detailed description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, and your desired resolution.
Once we receive this, we will attempt to respond to you, based on the contact information which we have available to us.
Should we attempt to make contact with you and find that our contact information is out of date, or that our attempts to make contact go unanswered, we will no longer engage in resolving this Dispute, and waive any liability from the Dispute.</p>
<p>Your claim should be sent to us at info@wave.ac with “[ATTN: LEGAL DEPT]” in the heading of the email.
Alternatively, you can call and leave a message at (202) 681-1314, but you must provide all information aforementioned--including your full name, username (if applicable), and a form of contact other than your phone number.</p>14.1.
Dispute Arbitration<p>If we cannot adequately resolve a Dispute, you and wave.ac agree that your dispute, claim, or controversy which arises will be determined by a mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.
You and wave.ac further agree that the arbitrator may have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objection with respect to the validity of this Arbitration Agreement.
Arbitration is not like a typical lawsuit and THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION.
There may be limitations on discovery in the arbitration process.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement, and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including reasonable attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief--declaratory, injunctive, or otherwise—benefiting anyone but the parties involved in the arbitration.</p>
<p>Independent this form of arbitration, you agree that nothing in this agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s rights to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.
small claims court.
or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending on a final ruling from the arbitrator.
Furthermore, you and wave.ac reserve the right to bring issues to the attention of local, federal, or state agencies.</p>14.2.
Arbitration Rules<p>Either wave.ac or you may start proceedings.
Any arbitration between you and wave.ac will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitrartion Agreement.
You and wave.ac acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the enforcement of this provision.
Information on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, and access to AAA Rules, can be found online at adr.org.
Alternatively, you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>14.3.
Class Action Waiver<p>YOU AND WAVE.AC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Unless agreed upon by you and wave.ac, no arbitrator may consolidate the claims of multiple individuals or preside over a representative or class proceeding.
All injunctive awards may only be awarded to an individual party.</p>14.4 Injunctive Relief Waiver &amp.
Force Majeure<p>IF YOU CLAIM YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF WAVE.AC, THE SERVICE, ECOSYSTEM, OR ANY OF ITS APPLICABLE TOOLS OR RESOURCES, THEN YOUR CLAIM WILL DISQUALIFY YOU FROM SEEKING OR OBTAINING ANY COURT OR ARBITRATIVE ACTION WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY SITE, APPLICATION, MEDIUM, CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, UTILIZED, OR CONTROLLED BY WAVE.AC LLC.
FURTHERMORE, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO YOU FOR ANYTHING WE MAY OTHERWISE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, IF IT IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.
In other words, don’t blame us for things that have nothing to do with wave.ac, and even if you believe you’ve suffered material loss in connection with the use of wave.ac, you will not hold us responsible.</p>
