</ul> Project Working Mom Do mom skills apply to college?<p>Parents headed back to school may fear they won’t have what it takes to be successful students.
But likely,many of the skills you use every day as a parent could help you navigate your college program – like multitasking,juggling multiple obligations and scheduling conflicts,staying organized,and ignoring distractions in order to focus on the task at hand.
Likely,parenthood has taught you a thing or two about responsibility,and that could be an advantage many younger college freshmen don’t have.
Hopefully,you’ve also learned to ask for help when you need it.
Seeking assistance from professors and making use of college resources is an important part of being a student,and that just might be second nature for parents used to speaking up on behalf of their children.</p>
<p>Finally,working parents may have a lot at stake when they pursue a college degree.
They may be likely willing to work harder than they thought possible to achieve a better life for not just themselves,but their kids as well.
If that sounds like you,consider some of the resources that may be available to help working parents purse a college education.
You might be surprised at what you’re capable of!</p>

<p>Apply Now</p> What is Project Working Mom?<p>Project Working Mom aims to support and inspire the educational goals of working mothers across America.
Project Working Mom helps people find scholarships for working moms and scholarships for dads going back to school.
This project has made it possible for busy working moms to find financial resources to assist in their goals of returning to school.
Additionally,the project has helped moms identify which degree may be right for them in going back to school and how to apply for educational scholarships,financial aid,and grants.</p>
<p>Project Working Mom has successfully elevated the issue of adult students’ needs to the level of national discourse.
Thanks to Project Working Mom’s many inroads,we’re confident that community leaders and organizations will continue to address the barriers – time,money and confidence – that separate working parents from the higher education opportunities they need.</p>Scholarships for Working Moms<p>To date,245 moms and dads received full-tuition scholarships for online degrees in their various fields.
The awards granted through Project Working Mom are worth a combined total of 9 million dollars.
And many of the recipients are already using their education to excel professionally.</p>
<p>If you’re among the millions of working moms or dads trying to support a family,you’ve probably given some thought to building a brighter future for yourself and your kids.
If you’ve ever wondered how college could empower you to pursue new career goals,you might have heard of Project Working Mom.
This program was created to help hardworking moms and dads pursue an education despite the many curveballs life can throw! Project Working Mom helped parents identify degree options that interested them,as well as possible financial resources to help make college a reality.
Most importantly,Project Working Mom awarded 9 million dollars’ worth of full-tuition scholarships for online degrees to those who qualified,helping 245 moms and dads to pursue their college dreams.</p>Project Working Mom aims to help parents overcome the hurdles of higher education<p>In 2014,there were about 12 million single-parent families in the US,and more than 80% were headed by single mothers[i].
That means continued education for moms that work is particularly important! But many working moms and dads share similar roadblocks when it comes to going back to school.
Some busy parents can’t find the time to attend classes in between a full-time job and taking care of the kids,housework,and other responsibilities.
For moms and dads in this tough position,earning a college degree can seem impossible.
Some may find that an online degree program offers a bit more flexibility and allows busy parents to complete coursework from anywhere with an internet connection – including at home after the kids are in bed! The option of online learning may be worth thinking about if a hectic schedule is getting in the way of your college goals.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle many single parents face is money.
If you’re supporting kids and trying to make ends meet,it may be tough to imagine yourself affording college tuition.
On the other hand,college may be a necessary step if you want to pursue a career that helps you pay the bills.
Financial resources might be available to help those who qualify to make college a possibility.
Consider looking into grants and scholarships for working moms,as well as federal and private financial aid and student loans that may be available to qualified individuals.
You may also be able to use personal budgeting strategies in order to pay for college as you go.</p>
<p>While time and money are major reasons parents put off college,there’s a big,often-unspoken reason why moms and dads don’t go back to school:lack of confidence.
Not believing in yourself can make college seem scary.
You may worry that you won’t be able to handle your classes,or that you don’t have the strength to be both a student and a mom.
Fortunately,many colleges have resources to help students like yourself – whether you need tutoring,academic advising,or career counseling.
And while juggling student responsibilities along with parenting can be a challenge,many moms and dads jump at the chance to set a great example for their children.</p>Working parents who pursue their dreams<p>If you are a working parent planning to attend college,you’re not alone.
In 2012,17% of children from single-parent households had a parent who had earned a bachelor’s degree or higher.
For two-parent households,that number rose to 47%! [ii] Hopefully,more diverse educational opportunities for working parents will mean that even more moms and dads reach their goal of earning a college degree.</p>
<p>Sometime a little inspiration can help you picture yourself achieving your career dreams.

Collection of Usage Information helps us to improve the Services and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to, among other things: (1) estimate our audience size and usage patterns.

<p>We and certain third parties, such as but not limited to advertising service providers, may use certain technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services.</p>
<p>The automatic collection technologies we and our service providers may use for this automatic information collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies (or browser cookies).
A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser or related software and stored on your computer's hard drive when you visit a website.
Generally, cookies can track what you look at and where you travel on websites and what transactions you make.
They can also store Personal Information about you, including your username and password.
A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your browsing session with the particular website.
A "persistent cookie" stores information on your hard drive so when you end your browsing session and return to the same website later, the cookie information is still available.
The Services may use both types of cookies.</li>
<li>Flash Cookies.
Certain features of the Services may use locally stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on the Services.</li>
<li>Web Beacons.
Pages of the Services and any emails we send to you may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened our emails and for other related website analytics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
<li>Local Storage (LSs).  We use LSs such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>For more information about managing your privacy settings regarding automatic collection of Usage Information, see the Your Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information section.</p>
<p>
<strong>Supplementation of Information</strong>
</p>
<p>If applicable to the Services you are using, in order to provide accurate school matching services to you, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.</p>
<p>

<strong>Customer Testimonials</strong>
</p>
<p>We may post customer testimonials Site, which may contain personally identifiable information like a video along with their first and last name.
We do obtain the customer's consent via email or via other means prior to posting the testimonial to post their name and video along with their testimonial.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads</strong>
</p>
<p>With the exception of certain of our webpages, services or features that may collect sensitive Personal Information such as financial information, we may permit third-party advertising companies or ad networks to display third-party advertisements on our websites and/or automatically collect Usage Information from our websites for purposes of determining your preferences and delivering interest-based advertising and content to you on the Services or other online properties, including those operated by third parties.
Those ads may include ads for our products or services or for other companies' products or services.</p>
<p>These third-party advertisers may combine the Usage Information with Personal Information you directly submit to them or that they receive from other sources, or the Usage Information they collect may include information that could allow someone to specifically contact you online without necessarily knowing your identity.
We do not have access to or control over the automatic collection technologies that these third-party advertisers may use, and the information practices of these third-party advertisers are subject to these parties' respective privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.
Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as this Site.
We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.
If you visit a third party website that is linked to this Site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.</p>

These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Services, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.
