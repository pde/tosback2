<p> This Section 26 is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and NBCUniversal agree that we intend that this Section 26 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
This Section 26 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
For non-U.S.
residents, if binding arbitration is adjudged by a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of Section 27 shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and us.
</p>
<p> We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.
Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Site or other online services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with NBCUniversal, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to NBCUniversal or that NBCUniversal may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, "NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.
By using or interacting with the Site or other online service, or engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
</p>
<p> We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.
If those efforts fail, by using our Site or other online service, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBCUniversal, and any claim that NBCUniversal may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules").
The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.
If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances).
If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, NBCUniversal agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 26, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.
Furthermore, this Section 26 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
You further agree that: </p>
<p> (a) <strong>Single Arbitrator.</strong> The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and NBCUniversal (the "Arbitrator");</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.</strong> The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or these arbitration provisions in Section 26 hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Location of Arbitration.</strong> The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business).
or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and NBCUniversal.
or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.<br>
</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Governing Law</strong>
<strong>.
</strong> The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles.
(ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable.
(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p>
<p>(e) <strong>No Class Relief</strong>.
The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBCUniversal's individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>
<p>(f) <strong>Written Award</strong>.<strong>
</strong> The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award").
Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;<br>
</p>
<p>(g) <strong>Arbitration Costs.</strong> In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NBCUniversal will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p>
<p>(h) <strong>Reasonable Attorney's Fees</strong>
<strong>.
</strong> In the event you recover an Award greater than NBCUniversal's last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award NBCUniversal's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the Arbitration, but NBCUniversal shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees.
and </p>
<p> (i)<strong>Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause</strong>.
With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBCUniversal shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
</p>
<p>(j)<strong>Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice</strong>.
NBCUniversal may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after NBCUniversal has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from NBCUniversal Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.<br>
</p>
<p>(k)<strong>Small Claims Matters are Excluded.
No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against NBCUniversal in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit.
provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.
<br>

<p> We do our best to describe every product or service offered on this online service as accurately as possible.
However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the online services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.
In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, NBCUniversal shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion.

Additional Terms may apply.

<p> NBCUniversal is the seller of certain goods and services on the online services.
All items purchased from the online services are made pursuant to a shipment contract.
This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier.
</p>
<p> The Service may offer certain services (including without limitation, CNBC Plus) for which we charge a fee that is billed in regular increments (e.g.
monthly or yearly) in order for registered users to access the service ("Subscription Services").
</p>
<p> Free Trials </p>
<p> From time to time, we may offer our Subscription Services (including without limitation, CNBC Plus) through a free trial.
Free trials are only available to first time subscribers of the Subscription Service and cannot be combined with any other offer.
Only one free trial may be redeemed per person.
You must have Internet access, valid email address and a valid credit card ("Payment Method") to redeem a free trial offer.
Upon registering for your free trial, your Payment Method will be authorized for the length of subscription indicated during the registration process.
In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may reflect the authorization.
however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.
</p>
<p> At the end of any free trial period, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the indicated subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plus any applicable tax unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial.
You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that your paying subscription has begun.
YOU MUST CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL OFFER TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.
CLICK THE "MEMBER CENTER" LINK AT THE HOME PAGE OF THE SERVICE FORCANCELLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a regular basis for your subscription plan until you cancel.
You may cancel your subscription at anytime.
We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans.
Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly, or year or yearly refers to your billing cycle (See "Billing" below).
</p>
<p> Subscription fees are subject to change.
In the event of a change in any subscription fee, a notice regarding the subscription fee change will be posted at the Member Center or you will be sent an email prior to the effective date of the fee change.
It is the sole responsibility of the subscribers to check this page from time to time for any such notices.
</p>
<p> Credit Card Billing </p>
<p> By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you are expressly agreeing that we are permitted to bill you a periodic (e.g., monthly or yearly) subscription fee, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Subscription Service.
As used in these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate a charge against your Payment Method.
YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDE.
The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each periodic renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership.
We will automatically bill your Payment Method each period on the calendar day corresponding to the day after your free trial has ended.
In the event a monthly membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we will bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month.
For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28th.
If you received a free trial, your Payment Method will be authorized for the approximate period of service indicated during registration for the free trial.
however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.
All fees, taxes and charges are nonrefundable.
There will be no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless required by applicable law.
We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by posting a notice at the Member Center or by e-mail.
If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by clicking on the "Member Center" button, available at the top of the home page of the Service.
If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Subscription Service constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
If a charge to your credit card is denied for any reason, We shall have the right to terminate or suspend your subscription and your access to the Subscription Service.
</p>
<p> Automatic Renewals </p>
<p> Your subscription to a Subscription Service will be automatically renewed on a periodic (e.g., monthly or yearly) basis.
We will bill the applicable subscription fee plus any applicable tax to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).
Your subscription will automatically renew for successive periodic subscriptions, without prior notice to you, unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews each period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method.
</p>
<p> Cancellation </p>
<p> You may cancel your subscription to a Subscription Service at anytime, and cancellation will be effective at the end of the applicable period during which you notify CNBC of your cancellation.
WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-PERIOD SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR UNUSED SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
To cancel, click the word "Unsubscribe" on the "Member Center" page and follow the instructions.
</p>
<p> We reserves the right to discontinue any Subscription Service at any time, and to cancel your subscription in connection with the discontinuation of the Subscription Service.
