<u>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</u>
</p>
<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect information about your activities on the Gartner websites and apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Cookies and other local storage technologies</u>.
Cookies and local storage objects are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party transfer to or read from your device to recognize the device, provide services, keep records, and conduct analytics and marketing.

These means include various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage). </li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.  Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage and Flash storage.  However, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies or local storage, certain websites (including our own Websites) may not function properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Other technologies</u>.
We use other standard automated technologies, such as web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) or similar technologies to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our websites and/or apps.

</ul>
<p>In some cases, we facilitate the collection of information by advertising services administered by third parties.
The ad services track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they use this information to show you ads tailored to your individual interests or characteristics and/or based on prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we know, infer or have collected from you. </p>
<ul>

<li>Recognize you and your devices;</li>
<li>Inform, optimize, and serve ads.
