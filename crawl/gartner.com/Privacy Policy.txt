<u>Communication with Colleagues</u>
</p>
<p>You may use the send-to-colleague functionality on some of our sites or apps to send your colleagues information from Gartner or its subsidiaries.
In order to fulfil this request, we will ask you for your and your colleagues' names and email addresses.
We do not retain this data after the email is sent.
Please be aware that your name and e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your colleague.</p>
<p>
<u>My Favorites</u>
</p>
<p>The My Favorites feature of the member websites allows clients to save content available to the member’s Favorites list, add labels, tags, and notes to saved content, and share content and notes with, and receive content and notes from, other clients.
We may review information about your use of My Favorites, including the content you save, folders you create, any tags, labels, or notes you add to your saved content or folders you have created, and any content that you share, and use such information to recommend content, tools, or other Gartner services we think may be of interest to you.
Information about your use of My Favorites will only be accessible to Gartner and will not be visible to or otherwise shared with other Gartner clients unless you choose to share it.</p>
<p>
<u>Restricted Areas</u>
</p>
<p>If you access the Restricted Areas of any of our sites (via browser or a Gartner app), we may collect information about your access to and use of research materials, decision-support tools, and other online and offline resources we offer.</p> 2.
WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To Gartner group companies in order to process the data for the above mentioned purposes;</li>
<li> When we have your consent or authorization to do so, e.g., when you have allowed an event sponsor to scan your attendee badge;</li>
<li>To third parties who work on our behalf to service or maintain business contact databases and other IT systems, such as suppliers of the IT systems which we use to process personal information, or who provide other technical services, such as printing;</li>
<li>To third parties providing services to us who have a need to access your information, such as our professional advisors (e.g.
auditors and lawyers) or venues for our events;</li>
<li>To comply with applicable laws, protect rights, safety and property, and respond to lawful requests from public authorities (such as disclosing data in appropriate situations for national security or law enforcement purposes);</li>
<li>Subject to applicable law, in the event that Gartner is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets (including in bankruptcy), or in the event of another corporate change, in connection with such a transaction, or for pre-transaction review in relation to such transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal information may be shared if we anonymize and/or aggregate it, as in these circumstances the information will cease to be personal information.</p>
<p>
<u>Utilization Information</u>
</p>
<p>We may share information with our organizational clients about how their employees use the sites and the resources available to them through the sites (e.g.
how employees used certain features of the sites, utilization trends, which features were most popular with the member’s employees).</p> 3.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS <p>Gartner is a global company and, as such, we may transfer personal information to other Gartner group companies or suppliers outside your home jurisdiction.
Gartner will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>Gartner may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Notice on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.</p>
<p>The countries to which we transfer data outside of the EEA may include any of the countries in which Gartner does business.
A list of Gartner office locations can be found here.</p>
<p>All Gartner entities have signed an Intragroup Agreement containing the European Union (“EU”) Commission Approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area.
All Gartner entities have the same technical, physical, and administrative security controls and are required to comply with our data protection policies and procedures, applicable laws, and the terms of our client and member contracts governing the collection and use of information.</p> 4.
RETENTION PERIODS <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations mandate that we retain your personal information.  We may also retain personal information for the period during which a claim may be made in relation to our dealings with you.  </p>
<p>In general terms, this will mean that your personal data will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:</p>
<ul>
<li>the period required by tax and company laws and regulations.
and</li>
<li>as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims.
This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws. </li>
</ul> 5.
CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION <p>We believe it is important to give you choices about the use of your information.
We will use your information as described in this Policy (or any other event- or service-specific Privacy Policy).
If we want to use your information for a purpose not described in this Policy, we will first get your consent to do so.</p>
<p>
<u>Marketing Communications</u>
</p>
<p>We will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications.
You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address here .
If you gave us your email address to receive marketing communications, you can opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions included at the bottom of our emails.
Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any opt-out request.
We will <u>not</u> sell or share your information or information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>
<u>Gartner Everywhere</u>
</p>
<p>Gartner Everywhere is an extension for Google Chrome that allows clients to customize their Gartner experience by providing them with Gartner research applicable to the websites they are browsing in real-time via an easy to access pop-up in their browser.
You can easily disable the extension and its collection of URLs by doing the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the extension Gartner Everywhere button on the top of the browser window.</li>
<li>Click the green toggle button to switch off.</li>
<li>Select the duration that you would like to switch off the extension for.</li>
<li>The extension will be automatically activated after the selected time period.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u>Events</u>
</p>
<p>When you attend one of our events, you will be issued an events badge with an RFID chip, which has a unique identifier that can be scanned from various distances.
If you select an RFID-enabled badge, we may use it to track your location around our event sites so we can better understand your areas of interest.
If you do not want us to track your location, you may obtain a non-RFID enabled badge by asking Events staff at the registration desk.</p>
<p>You may choose to share your contact details with our event sponsors by allowing them to scan your event badge.
Our sponsors’ use of any information you choose to share with them in this way is governed by each sponsor’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<u>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</u>
</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
We do not recognize or respond to browser-related DNT signals, as the industry is currently working toward a common approach to responding to DNT.

DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS <p>You have certain rights, in certain circumstances, in relation to your personal information.
A summary of each right and how an individual can take steps to exercise it is set out below.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details specified above for the Data Protection Officer.
Such requests should include appropriate identity verification information (such as your name, address, email address or other information reasonably required).</p>
<p>Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we shall provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.
This may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example where requests are complex or numerous.</p>
<p>The information will be provided free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.
In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request.
We will advise you of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.</p>
<p>We may ask for additional information to verify your identity before carrying out a request.</p>
<p>Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform you without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How you can exercise the right</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to access and/or correct your personal information</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, as well as to be provided with a copy of the information (in most circumstances).
You also have the right to correct any information we may hold about you that is inaccurate.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to restrict use of your personal information</strong>
<br>
</p> You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal data where one of the following applies:<ul>
<li>The processing is unlawful but you want us to restrict use of the data instead of deleting it;</li>
<li>Where you contest the accuracy of your personal data, the restriction will apply until we have verified the accuracy or corrected your personal data;</li>
<li>We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still require us to keep it in connection with a legal claim;</li>
<li>You have exercised your right to object to the processing.
The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Right to request deletion of your personal information</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in certain circumstances.
Please note that if you want us to refrain from sending you marketing communications, the best way to ensure that is to allow us to retain your information with a “do not contact” tag so we know not to contact you in the future.</p>
<p>There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to object to processing of your personal information</strong>
