 Print Terms of Service About This Terms of Service
<p> The AOL Terms of Service (TOS) consists of these terms, the AOL Privacy Policy, the Community Guidelines, and any supplemental terms provided to you for any of the products, services, software, websites, and other goods and services offered, owned, or operated by AOL Inc.
(collectively “Services”).
It is a contract in electronic form between you (“you,” “your,” and “yourself”) and AOL Inc.
and its parents, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, and family of brands (“AOL,” “we,” “us,” and “our”).</p>
<p> By using the Services or registering with us, you are agreeing to the TOS and may use our Services as long as you comply with the TOS.</p> Registering a Username and Keeping Your Account Active
<p> You will need a username to use some Services.
A username is a unique identifier selected or supplied by you or provided by us and is used to identify you on our Services.</p>
<p> To register a username and create an account, you must be a United States resident and at least 13 years of age unless the Service expressly indicates otherwise.
You must give us true and accurate information about yourself and keep that information up to date.</p>
<p> You may be able to use an e-mail address or other online identifier provided to you by someone other than us as a username.
You are responsible for maintaining security and control over any e-mail address or online identifier provided to us as a username.
If you fail to maintain security or control over such an e-mail address or other online identifier, you are responsible for any consequences and may lose access to your personal information and any data stored on our Services.
Also, we are not responsible for the release or loss of any information that is identified with that address or identifier.</p>
<p> Your username and account may be terminated if you do not sign on a Service with your username at least once every 90 days.
If you are registered for fee-based or term-specific Services, we will not terminate your username or account unless they are subject to being terminated for some other reason.
In addition, an individual Service may require you to sign in and use the Service periodically to remain active on that Service.
If you fail to remain active on a specific Service, we may deactivate your access and use of that Service.</p>
<p> After we terminate or deactivate your account for inactivity, we have no obligation to retain, store, or provide you with any data, information, e-mail, or other content that you uploaded, stored, transferred, sent, mailed, received, forwarded, posted or otherwise provide to us (collectively “posted” or “post”) on the Services and may allow another user to register and use the username.

<p> We may offer fee-based Services.
Our provision of those fee-based Services will be governed by the terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and any terms in this TOS not inconsistent with those terms.</p>
<p> If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information.
All billing information, including payment method, must be kept up to date.</p>
<p> We will bill you for all fee-based Services through the payment method that is associated with any of your fee-based Services.
You agree to pay us for all charges incurred under your account, including all applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges.
You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if your designated payment method fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us.
Further, you authorize and direct us to retain information about the payment method(s) associated with your account.
If we do not receive payment from your designated payment method or any other payment method on file, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.</p>
<p> We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis.
We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.</p>
<p> Every time you use a fee-based Service, you reaffirm that (a) we are authorized to charge your designated payment method.
(b) we may submit charges incurred under your account for payment.
and (c) you will be responsible for such charges, even if your account is canceled by you or terminated by us.</p>
<p> Surcharges apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account, or telephone bill.</p>
<p> You agree that we may charge you and you will pay to use certain “toll free” telephone numbers (“Long Distance Access Numbers,” e.g., telephone numbers that begin with 800, 866, 877, 888, and other area codes that the telephone carriers may make available in the future) (“surcharge”) to access the Internet using one of our Services.
Telephone carriers may or may not charge for using these Long Distance Access Numbers.
Information on the amount of this surcharge and on available dial-up phone numbers is located at http://access.web.aol.com.
You can incur long-distance or toll charges or surcharges for using a Long Distance Access Number even during a free trial.</p>
<p> Any trial promotion for a fee-based Service (such as free trial time for a paid Internet access service) must be used within the specified time of the trial.
You must cancel your account before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged a subscription fee.
However, even during any free trial or other promotion, you will still be responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your account and any sub- or linked-accounts.
We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials, promotions, and other offers.</p>
<p> You can get information about billing or determine the status of your bill and the amounts of any surcharges for the Internet connectivity Service at http://help.aol.com.
You can also contact a customer service representative at 1-800-827-6364.</p>
<p> All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service.</p>
<p> We, in our sole discretion, may change or discontinue any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service.</p>
<p> We may change our fees and billing methods at any time.
We will provide you with notice of any change in your pricing at least thirty (30) days in advance.
If you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect.
Your continued use after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.
We will not refund any charges if you choose to cancel your account for this reason.</p>
<p> After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment.
We reserve the right to assess an additional 1.5 percent late charge (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than 30 days past due and to use any lawful means to collect any unpaid charges.
You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.</p>
<p> You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes, fees, surcharges, and purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account (including your children, family, friends, or any other person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your username, password, or other authentication credentials or information.</p>
<p> You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement.
If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.</p>
<p> If you are using our fee-based dial-up Internet connectivity Service, you are responsible for any telephone charges you may incur to access the Internet.
The use of a dial-up Internet connectivity number is the same as making a telephone call to that number and may result in additional charges on your telephone bill depending on your location and calling plan.
The locations and area codes listed in connection with these numbers are not necessarily indicative of whether a call will be local or toll free for you.
You should select dial-up Internet connectivity numbers carefully.
Please call your local phone company to ensure that the dial-up number(s) you select are in the local calling area.
This is especially important if there have been changes in area code designations, in your telephone service providers, or in your calling plan.</p>
<p> You may cancel or we may terminate a fee-based Service at any time.
You can cancel a fee-based Internet connectivity Service by calling, sending a fax, or mailing a letter to our Customer Service Department.
Cancellation will take effect within 3 business days of receipt of your request.
Complete information on our cancellation procedures for our fee-based Internet connectivity Service is available at http://cancel.aol.com/.
We will send you written confirmation of the cancellation of a fee-based Internet connectivity Service.
If you cancel near the end of your billing period and are inadvertently charged for the next period’s fee, call us to have the charges reversed.
If you subscribe to a fee-based Service other than Internet connectivity Service, you should consult the specific cancellation policies and procedures for those Services.
If your fee-based Service is canceled or terminated, any data you have stored on such Services may not be retrievable later.</p>
<p> In the event that your fee-based Service is terminated or canceled, no online time or other credits will be credited to you or can be converted to cash or other form of reimbursement.</p> Software License
<p> We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to install our software on any computer or device from which you wish to access our Services and to use the software to connect to and use our Services.

IN THOSE STATES, AOL’S LIABILITY AND WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p> General Legal Terms
<p> This TOS along with any supplemental terms for some Services constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and AOL and replaces any prior agreements between you and AOL.</p>
<p> We may modify this TOS from time to time.
If you do not agree to the changes, stop using our Services (and remember to cancel any fee-based services) before the changes take effect.
Your use of a Service after the effective date of any changes means that you agree to the changes.</p>
