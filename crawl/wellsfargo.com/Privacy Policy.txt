<em> This policy is effective as of November 30, 2006.</em>
<br>
<br>In the information age, Wells Fargo's commitment to protect your information and your privacy extends to your online banking.
While our privacy policies are the same whether you are online or not, we have extra measures in place to protect your privacy when you bank online with Wells Fargo.
1.
Are you a visitor?<br>
<br>
Wells Fargo provides various demos of its financial planning tools designed to help you make financial decisions and choose the products and services that are right for you.
For example, our Retirement Calculator or Mortgage Calculator allows you to create various "what if" scenarios to determine your financial needs.<br>
<br>If you do not bank online with Wells Fargo, we do not collect, capture, or retain personally identifiable information when you are just browsing and testing these scenarios.
By offering you this level of privacy during our demos, we believe you will be more likely to try the "what if" scenarios.
This means you may be more likely to find the products and services that fulfill your financial needs and goals.Back to Top 2.
Are you a registered user?<br>When you initiate an online application for one of our products or services, or register for an online service, our website will request information, such as your email address or your account number.
This information allows you to perform certain tasks (for example, correspond with us or review your accounts) and it allows us to provide the information you requested.
In these cases, we collect only the information necessary to interact with you.
We also gather data to track website usage, such as number of hits, pages visited, and the length of user sessions in order to evaluate the usefulness of our sites.Back to Top 3.
About cookies<br>
<br>Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server to the browser on your PC.
Cookies help websites to keep track of your preferences and to recognize return visitors.
So, when you return to a website you've visited before, your browser gives this data back to the server.
Contrary to reports about cookies, cookies do not contain viruses.We do not embed your Social Security number, account number(s) or password in our cookies.<br>
<br>Wells Fargo uses cookies to make your online experience with Wells Fargo and certain linked Web sites richer and more personalized based on the products and services you have with us.
Also, without revealing your identity, cookies help us confirm your identity and help us keep your transactions with us secure when you do your banking online.<br>
<br>We also use cookies for various purposes such as maintaining continuity during an online session, gathering data about the use of our site or monitoring our online promotions.
this information helps us inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.
These promotions may be offered to you via online ads, email, U.S.
mail or telephone, subject to the privacy preferences you have on file with Wells Fargo.
<br>
<br>We recommend that you complete your online transactions and sign off before surfing to other sites or turning off your PC.
We also suggest that you do not surf to other sites during your online banking session.<br>
<br>
<strong>You cannot bank online without cookies</strong>
<br>

About online marketing<br>
<br>When browsing the internet, you may see a banner ad for a Wells Fargo product or service such as an auto loan or a credit card.
These ads may appear on Yahoo, America Online, or other non-Wells Fargo websites.
We use third party ad serving companies to serve our ad banners to sites on which we've paid to advertise.
If you click on one of our ads, you go to the Wells Fargo site offering that particular product or service.<br>
<br>Sometimes, these ads may contain small graphics with "tags" in them.
These tags tell us how many people respond to our ads.
They do not identify you personally.
Instead, these tags are used only to measure the effectiveness of our ads placed on non-Wells Fargo sites.
The companies that distribute our ads are prohibited by contract from using information other than for the agreed upon purpose — to help us market our products and services and to measure response rates.<br>
<br>Wells Fargo also uses read-receipt notifications in our email communications.Back to Top 5.
We work to ensure privacy and security during your online sessions<br>
<br>The information you provide to us online is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
SSL is the leading security protocol for data transfer on the internet.
This technology scrambles your account information as it moves between your PC's browser and Wells Fargo's computer systems.
When information is scrambled, or encrypted in this way, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone other than Wells Fargo to read it.
This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your information when you bank with us online.Back to Top 6.
Protecting children's privacy online<br>
<br>From our websites, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from their parents.
We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our websites may link.<br>

Links to non-Wells Fargo sites<br>
<br>We are not responsible for the information collection practices of the non-Wells Fargo links you click to from our web pages.
We cannot guarantee how these third parties use cookies or whether they place on your computer cookies that may identify you personally.
We urge you to review the privacy policies of each of the linked websites you visit — before you provide them with any personally identifiable information.Back to Top 8.
Policy changes<br>
<br>If it is necessary to make changes to our online privacy policies, we will update the Wells Fargo Online Privacy Policy with the changes and new effective date.Back to Top       <p> About Wells Fargo | Careers | Privacy, Security &amp.
