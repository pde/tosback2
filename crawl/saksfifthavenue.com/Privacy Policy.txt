Collecting this information, and linking it with your personal information, helps us to tailor our website and enhance your online shopping experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, promotions, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.
      <strong>Personalized Third Party Advertisements</strong>: We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site.

Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you.
These advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising and offers you see on our site more closely reflect your interests and needs.

<br>  <strong>Q: </strong> What about security? A: Protecting the security of your information is very important to us.
When you transmit sensitive personal information (such as credit card information) from your computer to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
For our mobile website, we protect your payment card information using encryption technology when you place an order.
Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online.
However, we strive to protect your information and privacy.
