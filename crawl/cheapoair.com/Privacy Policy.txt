<b>THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</b> We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses tracking technology to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.<br>
<br> We use an outside shipping company to ship paper tickets, and a credit card processing company to bill you for travel products.
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
<br>
<b>SECURITY</b> The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
[To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html]<br>
<p>All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (AES with 128 and 256 bit secret key) While secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download.
Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time.<br>
<br> If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers.
As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.<br>
<br> We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.
Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.<br>
<br> If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [cservice@CheapOair.com]</p>
<br>
<b>GOVERNMENT AND LEGAL </b> We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.<br>
<br> We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
All amended terms automatically take effect as of the date this Privacy Policy is updated and published on the Site.
Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.
<strong>If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a prominent notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.</strong>
