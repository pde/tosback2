Financing through Affirm (also a “Payment Provider”) for qualified purchasers is also available.
Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated Payment Provider service, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities.

Billing disputes should be notified to the following email address: support@eero.com</p>

<li>Intended user of eero services<p>The Company Properties are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of eero Devices and/or products.
While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time.
Access to the Company Properties is subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond eero’s control, including service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers, among others.
You acknowledge these limitations and agree that, to the fullest extent possible by law, eero is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of access to the Company Properties.</p>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you may not use or permit any third party to use the Company Properties or the eero Devices, or any part thereof, in connection with any High Risk Activity.
To the fullest extent possible by law, you assume all risk of such uses, and if you or any third party you permit, use of the Company Properties or the eero Devices, or any part thereof, in connection with High Risk Activities, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the eero Entities (as defined below) harmless from all claims, expenses, and liability arising as a result of such use.
This provision does not require you to indemnify any eero Entity for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promises, misrepresentations, or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Company Properties or the eero Devices.
You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, the Agreement, or your access to the Company Properties.</p>

Actual energy savings and monetary benefits vary with factors beyond eero’s control or knowledge.
From time to time, as a part of the Services, eero may provide you with emails containing information that is unique to you and your energy usage and suggests an opportunity to save money on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Devices or Services.
We do this to provide you with insights based on our analyses and information about you and your use of the Devices.

<p>
<strong>Scope of Arbitration Agreement</strong> (“Arbitration Agreement”).You agree that all claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Agreement or the use of any product or service provided by eero, including eero Devices, or to any other aspect of your relationship with eero, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
and (2) you or eero may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English.

<p>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH EERO, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF UNDER SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS.
INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST EERO IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to eero inc., 660 3rd street, 4th floor, San Francisco, CA 94107 United States.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, eero will pay them for you.
In addition, eero will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Likewise, eero will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitration determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and eero.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and eero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
