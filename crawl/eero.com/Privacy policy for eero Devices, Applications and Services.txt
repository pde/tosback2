This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data (defined below) collected via the eero Devices, eero Application and the online services that we provide to users of eero Devices and eero Application(s) (“Services”, and together with the eero Devices and the Application, the “Products”)).</p>

</li>
<li>A note about children<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) regulates the collection of data about children under the age of 13 who are accessing a website or other Internet application.
Although the eero Plus portion of the Products are designed to support families with children of all ages, the administration, configuration, and management of the eero Devices and Services (e.g.
via the Application) is intended for use by adults over the age of 18.
We do not require any information regarding minor children in order to manage eero Devices or provide the Services.
We offer the opportunity to create profiles for each user of the Services, including minors.
To the extent that a user submits Personal Information about minor children, such information is encrypted in transit.
In the event that a child under the age of 13 chooses to use the Products, eero believes that its privacy policy and procedures comply with the requirements of COPPA.
If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at support@eero.com.</p>

In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>

<p>Your Service Provider.
Certain eero consumers purchase or rent their eero Devices from third party service providers such as ISPs, telecommunications companies, home security system companies, or professional audio-visual or network system integrators (“Service Providers”).
If you purchase or rent your eero Device from such a Service Provider, we may share your Device Data and Personal Data with the relevant Service Provider in order to enable the Service Provider to provide you with customer network support and service enhancements or improvements for the eero Device(s) and the services that they provide to you.
If you no longer receive services from your Service Provider but have properly retained your eero Device(s) and intend to continue using your eero Device(s), please contact us at support@eero.com to inform us so that we can disable the sharing of your Device Data with your former Service Provider.
In addition, Service Provider may share Personal Data about you with eero to enable eero to provide you with the Services and service enhancements or improvements for the eero Device(s), and, if applicable, to allow Service Provider and eero to track and reconcile the accounting of any applicable subscription fees for the eero Plus service.

</li>
<li>Custom Audiences.<p>We may use marketing tools such as Facebook's Custom Audience Lookalike Audience program that enables us to display personalized ads to consumers with characteristics similar to those of our existing eero customers.
To determine relevant characteristics of our existing customer base, we may process your email address and/or phone number through a “hashing” application that converts this information to a string of alphanumeric data that is then sent to Facebook to enable Facebook to identify other Facebook users with similar profile characteristics.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of future participation in our Facebook Custom Audience and Lookalike Audience program by sending an email, from the email address you are opting out of, to the email address provided in our contact information above.
For your opt-out to be effective, you must: (i) place the following text in the subject line of the email - "Opting Out of Facebook Website Custom Audience Ads", and (ii) in the body of the email, include your name and email address.
We will remove your name and email address from all of our future Facebook Custom Audience and Lookalike Audience datasets.
