Nevertheless, as part of the Unlimited, My Way Student Promotion, a parent or legal guardian may provide a Sprint device to a child under the age of 13.
In such cases, Sprint takes steps to minimize the data it collects from Sprint applications on the device and provides parents resources to control the information children can share with other parties.
In some instances, a parent may be able to review or request deletion of the personal information collected from a child's device, or take steps to prevent further collection of such information.
If you have any questions about Sprint's policies for student phones or about how to control the information collected on them from users under 13, or if you wish to correct or delete any personal information provided to Sprint on a student phone used by a child under 13, you can contact us using the contact information below.
You may also control the content your child may access by logging into sprint.com/manage, and reviewing the My Preferences tab.</p>
<p>Sprint allows children under 13 to participate in the Pokémon GO Mobile Trainer Rewards program with their parent or guardian’s consent.
