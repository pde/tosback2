</ul> Residential Services Agreement <p>
<strong>Effective April 12, 2018</strong>
</p>
<p>TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE TO SERVICE(S):</p>
<p>You ("You" or "Customer") understand and agree that Sections 1 through 26 of this Residential Service Agreement ("Agreement") apply to Suddenlink Communications' ("Suddenlink") provision of each and every service ("Service(s)") ordered by Customer or provided by Suddenlink as part of a Service, which may include cable television service ("Video Service"), high speed data service ("High Speed Internet Service"), voice service ("Phone Service") and any equipment rented from or otherwise supplied by or on behalf of Suddenlink to you ("Equipment").
For purposes of clarity, "Services" as defined herein excludes any services or equipment provided by Suddenlink Security, which are covered by separate agreement.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Agreement.</u>
</strong> Customer agrees to be bound to this Agreement by: (i) executing a copy of the service order presented to Customer at the time of installation ("Service Order"), (ii) ordering a Service, or (iii) using one or more Services at Customer's location.
Suddenlink may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time by posting the amended Agreement on the Company website at www.suddenlink.com, or by giving Customer notice in accordance with Section 22 of this Agreement.
Customer's continued use of the Services following such notice shall be deemed as Customer's acceptance to any revision in this Agreement.
If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer must immediately notify Suddenlink of Customer's intent to terminate Service and, unless Suddenlink specifies otherwise in writing, return all Equipment.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Residential Use.</u>
</strong> The Services provided are solely for Customer's personal, residential use and Customer shall not use Services for any commercial purpose.
Suddenlink shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion, what constitutes a "commercial" purpose.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Access to Customer Premises.</u>
</strong> Customer grants Suddenlink and its employees, representatives and/or agents the right to enter Customer's premises and access Equipment, the wiring within Customer's premises and Customer's computer(s) to install, connect, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, disconnect, remove or alter the Equipment, check for signal leakage, or install or deliver Suddenlink provided software ("Software").
Customer shall cooperate in providing such access upon request of Suddenlink.
If Customer is not the owner of the premises, Customer warrants that Customer has obtained the legal authority of the owner to authorize Suddenlink personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for the purposes described herein.</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Payment.</u>
</strong> The charges for one month of Services, including any deposits and installation and Equipment charges, are due upon installation of the Services.
Thereafter, Customer agrees to pay monthly recurring Service charges and Equipment charges (if any) in advance, including all applicable fees (such as restoration or experience fees), taxes, regulatory fees, franchise fees, surcharges (including a broadcast station surcharge) and other government assessments no later than the date indicated on Customer's bill.
Charges for non-recurring Services or Equipment charges will be reflected on Customer's subsequent bill at the then current applicable rates.
If Customer elects to pay by automatic recurring credit card, debit card or automatic clearing house payments, Customer authorizes Suddenlink to charge such accounts.
Failure to receive a bill does not release Customer from Customer's obligation to pay.
Failure to pay the total balance when due shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for termination of Service, removal of Equipment from Customer's premises and/or imposition of an administrative fee ("Administrative Fee") in accordance with applicable law.
Any Administrative Fee imposed on Customer is intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of costs of managing past due accounts.
Suddenlink does not extend credit to Suddenlink's Customers and the Administrative Fee is not interest, a credit service charge or a finance charge</p>
<p>
<strong>Monthly Subscriptions:</strong> Your monthly subscription begins on your start of service date and renews on a monthly basis thereafter until cancelled by you.
If your subscription renews on a day not contained in a given month, we will bill you, and your service period begins, as of the last day of such month.
The subscription fee for Service(s) will be billed at the beginning of your service month and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription.
PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS</p>
<p>You may cancel your subscription for a service period up to the last day of the service period prior to the service period that you wish to cancel, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period.
Any request for cancellation after the commencement of a service period will be effective at the end of the then-current service period.
Access to the Services will, if possible, continue to be provided at the location ordered or, if you move, to your new location if in a Suddenlink-served area (subject to any installation charges).</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Additional Fees.</u>
</strong> In addition to Customer's monthly recurring charges and any Administrative Fee, additional fees may be imposed, including fees for returned checks, Payment Assistance Fees for paying by phone, receiving a paper bill, charge card chargeback, early termination, reconnection and service calls.
Additional charges may also be imposed if collection activities are required to recover past due balances, including attorney fees.
A list of applicable fees is available from your local Suddenlink's office ("Schedule of Fees").
Suddenlink reserves the right to amend or change the Schedule of Fees from time to time.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Early Termination Fees.</u>
</strong> If you cancel, terminate or downgrade the Service before the completion of any promotional term to which You agreed ("Initial Term"), you agree to pay Suddenlink an early cancellation fee of up to two hundred ($200.00) plus all outstanding charges for all Services used and Equipment purchased for which you have not paid us prior to termination.
You agree that early cancellation fees or any other fees may automatically be charged to your account and your credit or debit card provided to Suddenlink Communications and you agree to pay such fees.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Security Deposits.</u>
</strong> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink may (a) verify Customer's credit standing with credit reporting agencies.
(b) furnish information about you (including your social security number), your account(s) and your payment history to those credit reporting agencies.
and (c) require a deposit or activation fee based on Customer's credit standing or past payment history with Suddenlink.
A deposit and/or activation fee does not relieve the Customer of the responsibility for the prompt payment of bills on presentation.
Security deposits paid by Customer for Equipment or Services may be used, to the extent permitted by law, to offset any unpaid balance or charges after termination of Service.
Customer shall remain liable for any outstanding balances after the security deposit has been applied.
Further terms and conditions of the security deposit may be contained in the deposit receipt given to Customer at the time the security deposit is collected.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Disputed Charges.</u>
</strong> Customer must notify Suddenlink in writing of billing errors disputes or requests for credit within thirty (30) days after Customer receives the bill for which correction of an error or credit is sought.
The date of the dispute shall be the date Suddenlink receives sufficient documentation to enable Suddenlink to investigate the dispute.
The date of the resolution is the date Suddenlink completes its investigation and notifies the Customer of the disposition of the dispute.</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Adjustments or Refunds.</u>
</strong> Any adjustment or refund shall be an amount equal to the pro-rata part of the monthly charges applicable to the interrupted Service and associated Equipment charges for the period of time during which the Service is interrupted.
The adjustment or refund will be accomplished by a credit on a subsequent bill for Service.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the liability of Suddenlink, its officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, vendors, carrier partners, content providers and other persons or entities involved in providing the Services or Equipment (collectively, the "Suddenlink Parties") for damages shall in no event, by reason of any delays, interruptions, omissions, errors, failures or defects in installation or service, exceed an amount equal to the Customer's Service charges and associated Equipment fees for a regular billing period ("Maximum Credit").
No credit allowance will be made for:<ol>
<li>interruptions of Service due to the negligence of or noncompliance with the provisions of the Agreement by Customer or any person authorized by customer to use the Service;</li>
<li>interruptions of Service due to the negligence of any person other than Suddenlink including, but not limited to, the other common carriers connected to the Suddenlink's facilities;</li>
<li>interruptions of Service due to the failure or malfunction of Customer owned equipment or third party equipment;</li>

<li>interruptions during any period when the interruption is due to implementation of a Customer order for a change in Service arrangements;</li>
<li>interruptions of Service due to circumstances or causes beyond the control of Suddenlink.</li>
<li>
<u>Limitation of Refund.</u> Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the event any amounts owed by Suddenlink to Customer are not claimed by Customer within one year of the date on which the amount became payable to Customer, Customer shall forfeit all rights to the refund and all such amounts shall become the property of Suddenlink.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<u>Equipment and Software.</u>

A Demand for Arbitration form can be found at from our website at www.suddenlink.com/demandforarbitration.
All arbitration shall be initiated and conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the AAA.
The AAA shall appoint the arbitrator.
The party initiating arbitration shall give notice to the other party by mailing a copy of the request for arbitration to the other party at the addresses on the Service Order.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Suddenlink or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Suddenlink is entitled.</li>
<li>
<u>Filing Fees.</u> Except as otherwise provided for herein, Suddenlink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the requirements herein.
If, however, (i) the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)) or (ii) if the arbitrator's award is less than the amount of Suddenlink's last written settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected, then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Suddenlink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</li>
<li>
<u>Waiver of Class Action.</u> All parties to the arbitration must be individually named and there shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or otherwise tried on a class action or consolidated basis or through a representative.
The arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
<li>
<u>Forum.</u> Arbitration of claims will be conducted in such forum and pursuant to such laws and rules related to commercial arbitration that are in effect on the date of the notice to arbitrate.</li>
<li>
<u>Venue.</u> Unless Suddenlink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your service address.</li>
<li>
<u>Award.</u> An arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this Agreement provides or award punitive damages or any other damages aside from the prevailing party's actual damages, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages required by statute and may order injunctive or applicable declaratory relief.</li>
<li>
<u>Increase of Award or Attorney's Fees.</u> If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the amount of Suddenlink's last written settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected, then Suddenlink will pay you the amount of the award or $5,000, whichever is greater.
