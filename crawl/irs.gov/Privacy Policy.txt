<u>Privacy and Civil Liberty Impact Assessments (PCLIA)<br>
</u>A PCLIA is a decision-making tool used to identify and mitigate privacy risks at the beginning of and throughout the development life cycle of a program or system.
PCLIAs help the public understand what PII the agency is collecting, why it is being collected, and how it will be used, shared, accessed, secured and stored.
The PCLIA uses the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) to assess and mitigate any impact on an individual’s privacy.
Generally, a PCLIA is required before a program or system containing PII becomes operational.</p>
<p>Generally, A PCLIA should accomplish these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure conformance with applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements for privacy.</li>
<li>Determine the risks and effects.</li>
<li>Evaluate protections and alternative processes to mitigate potential privacy risks.</li>
<li>Provide assurance to the public about the protection of privacy and constitutional rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approved PCLIAs are published on the U.S.
Department of the Treasury's Privacy Impact Assessment Webpage unless they are classified.</p>
<p>
<u>System of Records Notice (SORN)<br>
</u>A System of Records is a group of records under the control of any federal agency from which information is retrieved by a unique personal identifier assigned to an individual.
A SORN is a formal notice to the public published in the Federal Register that identifies the purpose for which PII is collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by the department or agency.</p>
<p>A SORN is required when a government agency has a system of records as defined above.
In some instances, the agency may have an existing SORN that covers a collection of systems or programs.</p>
<p>All SORNs are approved by the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer prior to publication and are sent to OMB and Congress for comment.  After, they are published in the Federal Register for thirty days to give the public notice and time to comment.
A program or system may not become operational until the SORN has been published for thirty days.</p>
<p>All IRS SORNs published in the Federal Register can be found on the U.S.
Department of the Treasury System of Records Notices Webpage.</p>
<p>
<u>Computer Matching Agreements<br>
</u>A computer matching program is required by the Privacy Act for any computerized comparison of two or more automated systems of records, or a system of records with non-federal records, for the purpose of establishing or verifying eligibility or compliance as it relates to cash or in-kind assistance or payments under federal benefit programs.</p>
<p>Notices for approved computer matching programs are published in the Federal Register and can be found on the U.S.
Department of the Treasury Computer Matching Programs Webpage.</p>
