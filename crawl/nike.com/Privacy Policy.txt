</ul>
<p>We use additional personal data in order to enable particular features within our Sites and Apps or services.  For example, we request access to your phone’s geolocation data in order to log your run route, your contacts to allow you to interact with your friends, your calendar to schedule a training plan or your social network credentials in order to post content from an App to a social network.  This personal data includes your:</p>

<strong>Tools to Manage What We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p>When using our Apps, we also inform you about our collection and use through standard permissions in app stores, mobile operating systems, and in the App experience.
We also prompt you for your consent where necessary.</p>
<p>In many cases, your web browser or mobile device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to control when your device collects or shares particular categories of information.  For example, your mobile device or web browser may offer tools to allow you to manage cookie usage or location sharing.  We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and use the tools available on your devices.   </p>
<p>At this time, we do not respond to “do not track” signals sent by web browsers.</p>
<p>
<strong>WHY and HOW We Use Your Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We use the personal data we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
<p>
<strong>To Provide the Features of the Sites, Apps, and Services You Request </strong>
</p>
<p>When you use our Sites and Apps, we will use your data to provide the product or service you have selected.  For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion.
If you reach out to our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question.</p>
<p>If you use our Apps to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this data and store it so that you can review it in the App.  Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity as well as data collected by your device during the course of your activity such as location data and movement data.  We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the App. </p>
<p>In many cases, to use particular features within our Sites, Apps, and services you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.  For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Apps, you may need to connect a heart rate monitoring device to the experience.
to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>To modify your (email or SMS) subscriptions or to opt-out of receiving Nike communication, please modify your preferences in the "view or change my profile" section of our Sites.  You can also contact us to exercise your rights related to your personal data via the contact details in the “Question and Feedback” section below or by sending an email to privacy@nike.com.</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the email address provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, unless you have opted-out.
In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information about Nike’s products, services, events and promotions.</p>
<p>We may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or services - such as your use of Nike’s Sites and Apps, your visits to or purchases made in Nike stores, your participation in Nike events and contests (possibly through other Nike affiliates) - to personalize communications and advertisements regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you.  For registered users, this may include data collected from your interactions with our Sites and our Apps that are associated with your account across devices.</p>
<p>Where legally required, we will also seek your consent for sending marketing communications.</p>
<p>
<strong>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</strong> </p>
<p>We may use the data you provide to us to operate our business.  For example, when you make a purchase, we may use that information for accounting, auditing and other internal functions.  As another example, we may use data about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Sites and Apps.<strong> </strong>

<strong>To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety</strong> </p>
