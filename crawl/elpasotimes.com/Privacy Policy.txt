<p> CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p> This policy describes the privacy practices of MediaNews Group, Inc.
and MediaNews Group Interactive, Inc., as well as MediaNews Group affiliates (“MediaNews”) relating to information collected from children.
This privacy policy does not apply to third party web sites, or to companies and persons that are not controlled by, affiliated with or managed by MediaNews.
For most MediaNews Web sites, MediaNews does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age.
In the event that MediaNews collects information from children under 13 years of age, this Children’s Privacy Policy shall apply.
</p>
<p> INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN </p>
<p> MediaNews does not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity.
We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any web site and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information.
MediaNews limits its collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g.
first name, screen names, age, gender, city, state, zip code and country of residence).
This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g.
completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information.
From time to time, however, we may request personally identifiable information (e.g.
child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes, email newsletters and offers, provide subscriptions, participate in chat rooms and message boards, or offer other online activities.
MediaNews does not and cannot condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.
Information is collected actively, such as through registration forms, and passively, such as through cookies.
</p>
<p> USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN </p>
<p> MediaNews occasionally offers contest and sweepstakes, which may be entered online.
When a child under thirteen 13 enters a contest or sweepstakes, or participates in another activity that requires the use of personal information, we will ask for a parent's email address so that we can notify the parent of the child's participation, obtain the parent’s consent and give the parent the option to have the child's information deleted.
All of the child’s personal information collected by MediaNews is securely maintained and used only for the specified purpose such as conducting the contest or sweepstakes and awarding prizes.
MediaNews does not keep any of the child’s personal information after the particular event is completed.
Sometimes, MediaNews uses agents or contractors to provide services that support the internal operations of the site, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes or sending prizes to winners.
In these cases, MediaNews requires the agent or contractor to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information and limit use to the specific services they are performing on our behalf.
</p>
<p> MediaNews may disclose information maintained as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
MediaNews may also disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.
Personal information is not disclosed to third parties except those who provide support for the internal operations of the site.
Parents can consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.
</p>
<p> PARENTAL ACCESS </p>
<p> MediaNews Group and MediaNews Group affiliates are the operators collecting information at this web site.
Please send an email or letter to our Privacy Coordinator at the email or mailing address provided below if you would like to do any of the following: </p>
<p> Access personally identifiable information that MediaNews has collected from your child, <br> Correct factual errors in such information, <br> Request to have this information deleted, or <br> Request that we no longer collect or maintain such information about your child.
</p>
<p> Please include your email address and telephone number where we can reach you.
MediaNews takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
</p>
<p> MediaNews may change this privacy policy from time to time.
The revised policy will be posted on the MediaNews Web site.
Please check this page periodically for changes.
