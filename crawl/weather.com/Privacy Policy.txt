How We Use and Share Your Information</p> One of the most valuable assets of our business is you.
Except as described below The Weather Channel does not rent, sell or share personally identifiable information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies.
<p>A.
The Weather Channel and its Affiliates</p> We use information collected on the Services, and disclose information to third parties, including your physical geographic location, to help fulfill your requests or in connection with the operation of the Services, for example to service your account, conduct a transaction or provide a service that you have requested, display information and advertisements that we believe match your interests and profile, facilitate updates to the Services, provide support, notify you if you've won a contest or sweepstakes, improve the working of the Services, and compile statistics about our users and your use of the Services.
We and such third parties may on occasion combine information about you with information obtained from other parties to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you.
<p>
At various points, we may provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive special offers from The Weather Channel and its affiliates.
If you choose to opt in, The Weather Channel and its affiliates will use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from The Weather Channel and its affiliates, including WSI Corporation, The Weather Underground LLC, and Weather Central, LP.
These products may include, for example, schedules for special programs on The Weather Channel cable network or offers to purchase a calendar from The Weather Channel.
</p>
<p>B.
Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</p> At times we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotions, products or services from third party sponsors.
With your permission, The Weather Channel will periodically send to you, via e-mail, offers and promotions from our third party sponsors which we select based upon your interests or user profile.
In this case we do not share your information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them.
You will always have the opportunity, to opt-out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each email.
In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services.
In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.
When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.
We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties.
You should review the privacy policies of these parties before supplying personally identifiable information to them.
<p>C.
Third-Party Processors</p> When your information is collected on the Services, it may be collected directly by or shared with selected third parties in connection with the operation of the Services or the provision of services to you ("Third Party Processors").
These Third Party Processors may include, for example, companies that operate our online store, that process credit card information or handle shipping for The Weather Channel, that deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service, that organize, administer, process, or provide advertising services, and/or that analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers as well as correcting and/or updating users' data based on information we provide them.
We also provide your information to third party mapping service providers to provide you map content for the Services.
Third party processors are authorized to use your information that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for The Weather Channel.
We require that the third party processors securely store the personally identifiable information we provide to them and maintain it so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes, and all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the personally identifiable information confidential.
<p>D.
Other Web Sites, Other Services, and Links</p> Like many Web sites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, many of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by various other entities.
In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer.
In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting.
In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities.
These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.
The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.
<p>
Some of our Services allow users to interface with other sites or services, including Facebook, Twitter, and SessionM's mPOINTS.
You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off those sites and services.
By proceeding with these interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services' Terms of Use.
Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services.
Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
Some of our Services use third party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone and tablet devices), and some of our Services are provided by third party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services.
The Weather Channel does not control these third party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information.
For example, these third party elements may gather information from our Services, including our applications, in a manner that overrides your settings and preferences in our Services.
