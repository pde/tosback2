Cookies are small text files that a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of a website, allow the site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.
Cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site.
If you do not want information collected from you through our use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature.
however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features available on the Site.</p>
<p>
<u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>
</p>
<p>We collect personally identifiable information about you when you specifically and knowingly provide such information voluntarily on the Site, including, but not limited to, during the following interactions: (1) when you register on the Site and when you later log-on with your user name and password.
(2) when you sign-up to subscribe to a service, a newsletter, or ask to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services.
(3) when you place an order for products or services.
(4) when you participate in a promotional offer.
(5) when you provide feedback in an online survey.
(6) when you submit other content and suggestions.</p>
<p>In each of the instances above, we typically ask for some or all of the following information: your full name, e-mail address, phone number, physical mailing address, the type of business you are in, product preference information, any applicable identification number or password that we may require, as well as other similar information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers.
On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain other information, materials and services.</p>
<p>The personally identifiable information you provide to us when using the Site may be used to provide products and services to you, to enhance your experience at the Site, and, if applicable, to enhance your experience as a subscriber to The Hill's products and services.</p>
<p>We may from time to time use your personally identifiable information to notify you of special offers and products and services from The Hill and/or from third parties that we think may be of interest to you.
It is possible that we may rent, sell or otherwise transfer to third parties personally identifiable information about you.
