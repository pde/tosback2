We strive to protect your online privacy, while providing an enjoyable website experience that provides information, products, and services that are relevant and useful to you.
The purpose of this Hyundai Privacy Policy for the U.S.
(“Policy” or “Privacy Policy”) is to notify and inform you of our website personal information practices.
This Privacy Policy applies to Hyundai and its affiliate companies.
We urge you to read the complete Privacy Policy as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use and contact us if you have any questions.</p>
<p>This Policy will describe the kinds of personally identifiable information we may gather when you visit our websites: HyundaiUSA.com and certain other Hyundai micro-sites (e.g., hyundainuvis.com or hmaservice.com).
Additionally, this Policy addresses how we may collect, handle and use that information, what choices you have to manage the personal information we collect about you, the circumstances under which we may disclose it to third parties, and the security of such information.<br>
</p> CHOICE :<br>Freedom of Choice <p>You may choose to share your personally identifiable information with us.
We use your information to notify you about our products and services and, where applicable, request your opinion.
However, your participation in using our websites and/or providing feedback is completely voluntary.
Should you not wish to consent, you can inform us in writing or via email at any time so that we can suppress or remove your personal data electronically.</p> Unsubscribe or Opt-out <p>Hyundai offers you the opportunity to opt-out from receiving promotional email or mail from Hyundai about our products and services.</p>
<ul>
<li>For email, users may opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism within the email.
The unsubscribe mechanism allows website users to manage their subscription preferences to email alerts and special offers.
Notwithstanding the above, this mechanism does not allow a user to opt-out of receiving transactional email, such as registration confirmation, vehicle updates and responses to direct requests.</li>
<li>For calls or direct mail, website users may opt out at consumeraffairs@hmausa.com or by calling (800) 633-5151.</li>
<li>If the information you have provided will be available to third parties, you will also be given the opportunity to opt-out from this practice at consumeraffairs@hmausa.com or by calling (800) 633-5151.</li>
<li>You also may write to us directly if you wish to: (a) update or delete your contact information.
(b) ask that we not share your personal information with third parties.
(c) opt out or request that we cease sending you promotional or other information via mail or email.

Box 20950, Fountain Valley, California 92728-0850.
In those instances, we will retain your information in a “do not promote” file in our database, and you will receive no further communications from us as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>At the time information is collected from you, other choices you have about how the information may be used will be explained.</p>
<p>If you have opted out of receiving future emails from us, we will implement your opt-out request within 10 business days of receiving the opt-out request.
If you have opted out of receiving future promotional materials by regular mail, we will implement your opt-out request within a commercially reasonable time.</p> COLLECTION :<br>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information <p>You may visit Hyundai's various websites to read vehicle product information or utilize our online tools without telling us who you are, and without revealing any personal information except for that information which may be obtained from cookies or other automatic information collection tools.
You may also choose to utilize our site to obtain services such as brochure and information requests, to order vehicle parts, and to receive site announcements and special offers at the time of the request or in the future.
To the extent that you utilize these online tools, Hyundai will collect and store the personal information provided by you, which is necessary to provide the requested services, or to improve the services that we provide to you in the future.</p>
<p>Hyundai may also invite you to participate in promotional activities, such as surveys, sweepstakes, contests, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs").
These Programs are oftentimes co-marketed with an unaffiliated Hyundai business partner.
If you participate in a Program, we may use information you provide.
For example, we may send you email messages to invite you to join a contest Program.
Your personal information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company.
If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this Privacy Policy will not apply to that company's use of your information.
Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the personal information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program.
If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern.
Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us (or our business partners) with any personal information.</p>
<p>Hyundai may also obtain information about you and your vehicle in a number of other ways (e.g., our website, business reply cards, sweepstakes entries, test-drive incentive applications, surveys, vehicle sales records, and other public sources).

<ul>
<li>Contact information (name, address, city, state and zip code, email address, and telephone number)</li>

<li>Demographic information (age range, marital status, household composition, etc.)</li>
<li>Non-credit-related marketing information (when you plan to purchase or lease, the vehicle in which you are interested, etc.)</li>
<li>Relationships you have with Hyundai affiliates and business partners such as XM Satellite Radio, Roadside Assistance Programs, etc.</li>
<li>Business reply cards and sweepstakes entries you complete at an event or in response to a marketing mailing we send may also ask you to answer some of these same questions so we can tailor what we send to you for your specific interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition, Hyundai dealers (which are all independently owned and operated) and other sources that provide lists of potential vehicle purchasers or current owners may provide to us the information they have regarding you or your vehicle.
We use this information to serve your needs through better customer service and to advise you of our products and services.</p>
<p>No Hyundai websites are intended for use by children under 13 years old as they are not of driving age.</p> USE :<br>How We Use Information About You <p>The information you share with us may be used by Hyundai, our affiliates, our subsidiary companies, our licensees, and our independent dealers.

</p> ONWARD TRANSFER :<br>Information Sharing With Third Parties <p>Hyundai may share website user or vehicle owner personal information with third parties including our affiliates, authorized dealers, licensees, suppliers and marketing partners, contracted to provide services on our behalf (e.g., brochure fulfillment) or so they could use it to offer you other valuable products and services.
In addition, user or vehicle owner data may be used by our suppliers to provide services for Hyundai, and by our business partners to conduct joint marketing programs with Hyundai.
We will not share your personal information with third parties other than these without your permission.

<p>Participating Vendors.
Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors.
On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we may also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank.

Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through Hyundai’s websites or any other service available online).</p>
<p>Changes in Corporate Structure.
In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred.
In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>
</p> SECURITY :<br>Website Security <p>You can visit Hyundai’s websites to read about our vehicles or use our online tools without providing any personally identifiable information (other than, in some cases, your zip code).

We use this information to generate aggregate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits (reported as aggregate information).
Website usage information that is shared with third parties is primarily pixel tags and GIF’s.</p>
<p>Hyundai takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' information online, both while the information is being transmitted and after it is received by us.
