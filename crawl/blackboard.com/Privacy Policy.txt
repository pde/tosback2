Support for SSL Encryption
<p>Any institution may choose to run its Blackboard Learn solution under SSL.
SSL is a browser technology that encrypts the data transmitted between your computer and the Blackboard server.
SSL websites have an address that begins with https:// instead of http:// (note the additional s).
Blackboard strongly encourages all schools to run under SSL to ensure data privacy of transmitted data and to secure the transmission of login and password information.</p>

<p>Blackboard complies with the U.S.&amp;—EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.—Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S.
