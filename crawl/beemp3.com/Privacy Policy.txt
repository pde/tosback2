</p>
<p>Beemp3s.org is a search engine which searches for mp3 files all over the Internet.
Since it is not feasible to verify legality of content placement in each specific case, we do our best to ensure that our crawler searches the officially approved websites in the first place, and does not search the websites that are officially known as providers of illegal content.
We manually include links to the sources officially approved by the major right holders into the index (e.g.
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) approved list published at https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=legal-music-services).
Moreover, websites which are officially found to contain illegal materials are manually excluded from the index.
In particular, we review regular reports of USTR (Office of the US Trade Representative) in order to eliminate from the index URLs of web pages that are reportedly engaged in piracy.
</p>
<p>Save for the manual intervention described above our search index is formed automatically, so for claims in respect of the URLs automatically added to our index, an effective system for processing such claims is in place.
Links addressing users to infringing content are removed shortly in accordance with the procedure described in DMCA section of the Website.
We include names of compositions or URLs reported in the claims into our blacklist to prevent search of such compositions or URLs on the Website and subsequent appearance thereof in our index.
Furthermore, we use hash filtering with the purpose to increase effectiveness of preliminary control.
Links which lead to mp3 files having the same hash sum as the copyrighted mp3 previously deleted from the index are not included into the index </p>
