Dispute Resolution – Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver <ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Agreement.</b> You and kbb agree that any claims or disputes (“claims”) that arise out of or relate in any way to these terms of service, kbb.com, or the services (including but not limited to billing disputes) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration instead of litigation in court..
In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury.
Instead, Claims are decided by an arbitrator whose authority is created by and governed by this arbitration agreement.
Review of arbitration awards in the courts is very limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Class Action Waiver:</b> you and kbb agree that all claims between us will be resolved in an individual arbitration.
We both agree that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.
In addition, neither you nor KBB may participate in a class or representative action in court as a class member if the claims asserted in the arbitration would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if asserted directly by you or KBB.
To be clear, you and KBB both waive any right to participate in any class action involving disputes between us.</p>
<p>This class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and may not be severed.
If for any reason this class action waiver is found unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement will not apply.
However, the Jury Trial Waiver set forth in Section 12 of these TOS will remain in full force and effect.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b> Arbitrator Authority:</b>: The arbitrator’s authority is governed by this arbitration agreement.
You and KBB agree that the arbitrator may award the same relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award – consistent with and limited by these TOS (including the limitations of liability set forth in Section 14), but the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief that extends beyond you and your dealings with KBB.
An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party if a court would be authorized to do so under the applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures:</b> You and KBB agree that your agreement affects interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
The AAA’s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If the Claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
If the claim is for more than $75,000, then the Commercial Rules will apply.
If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and this arbitration agreement, then this arbitration agreement shall control.
For claims less than $75,000, KBB will pay all filing fees and costs associated with commencing an arbitration, but you will be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees (if you chose to use an attorney in arbitration) unless you prevail in the arbitration and the arbitrator finds that you are entitled to recover your fees under the law.
The arbitration will be held in a mutually agreeable and convenient location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Survival:</b> This arbitration agreement survives the termination of these TOS between you and KBB.</p>
</li>
</ol>12.
JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
You and KBB expressly and knowingly <b>WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</b> This means that if for any reason the arbitration agreement contained in Section 11 is not enforced or is found inapplicable, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.
13.

</p>
<p>
<b>"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which is known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</b>
