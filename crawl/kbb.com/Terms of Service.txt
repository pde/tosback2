Kelley Blue Book Instant Cash Offer Program Terms and Conditions <ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Program Overview.</b> With the Kelley Blue Book Instant Cash Offer Program ("Instant Cash Offer Program") you can complete a questionnaire online or at a dealership and get a specific offer to buy your car for cash today ("Instant Cash Offer" or "Offer").
You can redeem your Instant Cash Offer for cash, or put the value of your Offer toward the purchase of another vehicle, subject to these Instant Cash Offer Program Terms and Conditions, the KBB.com Terms of Service including but not limited to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, and other terms and conditions provided through the Instant Cash Offer Program.
Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader do not redeem Instant Cash Offers or purchase vehicles.
rather, the Instant Cash Offer is redeemable at dealers who have paid Kelley Blue Book or an affiliate to participate in the Instant Cash Offer Program ("Participating Dealers").
The Instant Cash Offer is valid at any Participating Dealer for three (3) days (not counting Sundays) after it was issued.
It is important to note that the Instant Cash Offer is based on specific information about your vehicle, which may result in variations from the information collected in connection with a Kelley Blue Book Value.
The Offer may be less than the Kelley Blue Book Trade-In Value and may be lower than the Trade-In Range for a similar vehicle.</p>
<p>Your Vehicle must pass a mandatory vehicle inspection by a Participating Dealer.
If the inspection report differs from your description or online assessment of your vehicle's condition, the Participating Dealer may adjust the Offer amount, which may mean decreasing the Offer amount.
Participating dealers are not owned or operated by, nor are they affiliated with or acting on behalf of, either Kelley Blue Book or Autotrader.
Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader, and their affiliates expressly disclaim any liability resulting from an adjustment of the Offer or refusal to accept the vehicle by Participating Dealer(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Program Requirements.</b> In addition to the other KBB.com Terms of Service and other terms to redeem an Instant Cash Offer that you have received through the Instant Cash Offer Program: (1) your vehicle must be located in a market in which the Instant Cash Offer Program is offered.
(2) you must be the registered owner of the vehicle in question.
(3) you must possess a valid driver's license or other form of valid government-issued photo ID.
(4) you must not be an automobile dealer or an employee or agent of an automobile dealer.
(5) the personal contact information and the information about your vehicle that you provide in response to our online questionnaire must be accurate, complete, and truthful.
and (6) within three (3) days of the issuance of your Instant Cash Offer (not counting Sundays), you must deliver your vehicle, with a valid registration and either clear and unencumbered title in your name, or complete documentation regarding any lease obligations or liens on your vehicle (including, for example, contact information for your lender or leasing company, relevant account information, and the current loan payoff amount or lease early termination fee for your vehicle) to a Participating Dealer.
The Participating Dealer will inspect your vehicle to confirm its condition and verify the accuracy of the other information about your vehicle that you submitted online.
Based on the results of this verification inspection (more information below) reported by the Participating Dealer, the dollar amount of your Instant Cash Offer may be adjusted up or down prior to redemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Restrictions.</b> The Instant Cash Offer Program is not available in all areas and not all vehicles are eligible for Offers.
The Instant Cash Offer Program may not be used to sell or to trade in certain categories of vehicles at Kelley Blue Book's discretion, including, without limitation: current model year (or newer) vehicles.
commercial vehicles.
vehicles subject to recall or investigation by a government agency.
vehicles with a police, fire, livery or taxi history.
reconstructed or salvage vehicles.
vehicles without a valid Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
vehicles not originally built for the United States market or that were imported illegally or outside of official manufacturer channels (i.e., "gray market" vehicles).
vehicles older than 17 model years.
vehicles with altered drivelines or bodies or illegal or non-functioning emissions equipment.
vehicles registered at an auto auction or offered for sale on a wholesale website within 45 days.
and vehicles that we would value at less than $1,000.
You may use the Instant Cash Offer Program to sell or trade in a maximum of three vehicles in any six-month period.
Vehicles with an Offer value greater than $75,000 may not be accepted by every Participating Dealer and may require an additional inspection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Some Offers Require Review.</b> Although the majority of Instant Cash Offers generated by the Instant Cash Offer Program will be delivered within moments of submitting a valid request, some requests require manual review.
This manual review process usually will be completed within minutes of submitting a request but occasionally may take until the next business day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>The Information You Provide in Connection with Your Offer.</b> You acknowledge that if you provide us with any false, incomplete or inaccurate information, including, without limitation, vehicle information or personal contact information, your Instant Cash Offer may be immediately invalidated.
By requesting an Offer, you agree that we, our service providers, and Participating Dealers may contact you, by any method that you supplied for your contact information, about vehicles or other products and services that may be of interest to you.
By supplying a mobile number, you consent to receive calls or texts at that number, whether manually or automatically dialed, from us and from Participating Dealers.
You do not have to provide us with a mobile number as a condition of obtaining an Instant Cash Offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Participating Dealers</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Participating Dealers pay a monthly subscription to participate in and receive leads through the Instant Cash Offer Program.
Offers provided through the Instant Cash Offer Program are calculated and generated by a proprietary appraisal tool intended to generate a price reflecting a liquid cash offer to be honored by a Participating Dealer irrespective of whether you are purchasing another vehicle from that Participating Dealer.
Instant Cash Offer Program guarantees to Participating Dealers that your vehicle will be worth at least the amount of the Offer.
Participating Dealers are not owned or operated by, nor are they acting on behalf of, Kelley Blue Book, and, except as described herein, are not otherwise affiliated with Kelley Blue Book.
If you redeem your Instant Cash Offer at a Participating Dealer, you will have the option of either using your Instant Cash Offer to trade in your vehicle or to sell your car for a check.
If your Instant Cash Offer does not identify a Participating Dealer near you, please call our customer service department at 1-866-559-5268 or send us an email to request this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although Participating Dealers are not obligated to purchase your vehicle or accept your vehicle for trade for any price other than the amount of your Instant Cash Offer, you are welcome to try to negotiate a more favorable price or trade-in amount for your vehicle and, of course, you are always free to sell or trade-in your vehicle outside of the Instant Cash Offer Program.
Though we think the Offer allows for a convenient and easy way to sell your vehicle, it may not be the highest sale price or trade-in amount that you could receive for your vehicle outside of the Instant Cash Offer Program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Verification Inspections</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Participating Dealers will conduct a mandatory vehicle inspection free of charge to verify the accuracy of the vehicle description and condition information that you provided to us online.
This verification inspection may include, for example, paint thickness measurements, a road test, a mechanical inspection, and a review of vehicle history reports and disclosure statements regarding flood, salvage, or odometer discrepancies (including rollbacks), and the like.
The Participating Dealer will submit the results of the verification inspection to the Instant Cash Offer Program using the same online tool that you used to request your Instant Cash Offer, and we may raise or lower the dollar amount of your Instant Cash Offer prior to redemption based on the information revealed by the inspection.
All decisions of the Participating Dealer regarding the condition of your vehicle will be final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the conclusion of your vehicle verification inspection, you can redeem your Instant Cash Offer, subject to any applicable adjustments after the inspection, by delivering your vehicle on the spot or by returning your vehicle to your Participating Dealer's location by the end of the next business day in the same condition and with no more than 50 additional miles on the odometer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Redeeming Your Instant Cash Offer</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Selling Your Vehicle to a Participating Dealer.</b> If you decide to redeem your Instant Cash Offer by selling your vehicle, the Participating Dealer will issue you a check following the release of all applicable liens and lease obligations and the Participating Dealer's receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title, subject to Section 5.H.3.
All checks will be made payable to the vehicle owner(s) named on the vehicle title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Redeeming Your Offer Towards the Purchase of Another Vehicle.</b> If you elect to apply your Instant Cash Offer to the purchase of another vehicle, your Participating Dealer will issue you a credit toward the price of any vehicle available in its inventory in exchange for your vehicle.
The Offer credit will be given after the release of all applicable liens and lease obligations and the receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title (see Section 5.H.3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Equity in Your Vehicle.</b> If there are outstanding lien or lease obligations on your vehicle, the following will apply:</p>
<p>a) <b>Negative Equity.</b> If you have negative equity in your vehicle (i.e., your outstanding loan balance or lease payment obligation exceeds the amount of your Instant Cash Offer), you will be responsible for paying the difference between the Instant Cash Offer and the amount needed to clear the title to your vehicle by certified check or other form of payment acceptable to the Participating Dealer before your transaction can be completed.</p>
<p>b) <b>Positive Equity.</b> If you have positive equity in your vehicle, the Participating Dealer will issue you a check or a trade-in credit, as applicable, for the difference between the amount needed to clear the title (including any related fees) to your vehicle and the Instant Cash Offer.
Your Participating Dealer will assist you with the processing of the paperwork and payments necessary to settle your loan or lease obligations and to obtain a clear title to your vehicle.
This process typically takes 10 to 14 business days following delivery of a vehicle to a Participating Dealer, but it could take longer in some circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Release.</b> BY REDEEMING AN OFFER, YOU AGREE NOT TO SUE KELLEY BLUE BOOK, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "RELEASED PARTIES") FOR, AND AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RELEASED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY VEHICLE SALE OR INSTANT CASH OFFER TRANSACTION THAT YOU ENTER INTO WITH A DEALER IN CONNECTION WITH THE INSTANT CASH OFFER PROGRAM.
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ARISE OUT OF SUCH A TRANSACTION, YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO YOUR PARTICIPATING DEALER FOR YOUR REMEDY AND NOT TO THE RELEASED PARTIES.</p>

Dispute Resolution – Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver <ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Agreement:</b> YOU AND KELLEY BLUE BOOK AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ("Claims") THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, KBB.COM, OR THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BILLING DISPUTES) SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury.
Instead, Claims are decided by an arbitrator whose authority is created by and governed by this arbitration agreement.
Review of arbitration awards in the courts is very limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Class Action Waiver:</b> YOU AND KELLEY BLUE BOOK AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
WE BOTH AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE NO CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS IN ARBITRATION.
In addition, neither you nor Kelley Blue Book may participate in a class or representative action in court as a class member if the Claims asserted in the litigation would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if asserted directly by you or Kelley Blue Book.
To be clear, you and Kelley Blue Book both waive any right to participate in any class action involving disputes between us.</p>
<p>This class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and may not be severed.
If for any reason this class action waiver is found unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement will not apply.
However, the Jury Trial Waiver set forth in Section 14 of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitrator Authority:</b> The arbitrator's authority is governed by this arbitration agreement.
You and Kelley Blue Book agree that the arbitrator may award the same relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award – consistent with and limited by these Terms (including the limitations of liability set forth in Section 16), but the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief that extends beyond you and your dealings with Kelley Blue Book.
An arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party if a court would be authorized to do so under the applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Arbitration Procedures:</b> You and Kelley Blue Book agree that your agreement affects interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by JAMS Endispute under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS").
These Rules are available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1.800.352.5267.
If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this arbitration agreement, then this arbitration agreement shall control.
Kelley Blue Book will pay all filing fees and costs associated with commencing an arbitration, but you will be responsible for paying your own attorneys' fees (if you chose to use an attorney in arbitration) unless you prevail in the arbitration and the arbitrator finds that you are entitled to recover your fees under the law.
Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Kelley Blue Book agrees not to seek an award of attorneys' fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.
If you bring an arbitration against Kelley Blue Book, the arbitration hearing will be held in your hometown area, unless we both agree on a different location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Survival:</b> This arbitration agreement survives the termination of these Terms between you and Kelley Blue Book.</p>
</li>
</ol>14.
JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
<p>You and Kelley Blue Book expressly and knowingly <b>WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY</b>.
This means that if for any reason the arbitration agreement contained in Section 13 is not enforced or is found inapplicable, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.</p> 15.
