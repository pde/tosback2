<blockquote>
<p>(i) "Disputes" are any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to the Websites, Website Content or these Terms of Use - this includes claims you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives, and claims Scripps Networks may bring against you.
provided, however, that any issues relating to Scripps Networks' intellectual property rights, including any such rights Scripps Networks claims that may be in dispute, shall only be subject to arbitration if Scripps Networks’ General Counsel agrees in writing to have such subject to arbitration.
</p>
<p>(ii) If either of us wants to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the Dispute and the proposed resolution.  We will send notice to you based on the contact information you have provided us and notice to us must be sent to: Scripps Networks, LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 1180 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036.  We agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute.  If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then either of us may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration.</p>
<p>(iii) The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision.  We each agree the FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>(iv) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules as supplemented by AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.  In the event AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within forty-five (45) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration", then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
("JAMS") or any other mutually agreeable arbitration administration service.  You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or www.adr.org.
and from JAMS at (949) 224-1810 or http://www.jamsadr.com.  If applicable law requires Scripps Networks to pay a greater portion of the arbitration fees then provided under the applicable arbitration service’s rules in order for the arbitration provision to be enforceable, Scripps Networks shall have the discretion to elect to pay such fees and proceed to arbitration.   Discovery shall be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and will provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  The award shall be enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>
<p>(v) The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or a retired judge.  If an in-person hearing is required, the arbitration hearing will be conducted in the metropolitan statistical area in which you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted for arbitration.  The federal or state law that applies to these Terms of Use will also apply during the arbitration.</p>
<p>(vi) We each agree not to pursue arbitration on a classwide basis.
We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and us (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual’s claim).  If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn’t apply and the Dispute must be brought in court.
The provisions of this Section will not apply to any legal action taken by Scripps Networks to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Websites, any Website Content, your User Content and/or Scripps Networks' intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>(vii) Except where prohibited or limited by applicable law, the prevailing party(ies) in the arbitration will be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees, which are incurred in connection with the arbitration.  </p>

<p>(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court.</p>
