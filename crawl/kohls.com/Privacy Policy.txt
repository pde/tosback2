Back to Top SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCT SOURCING OUR PHILOSOPHY OUR POLICY OVERSIGHT OF OUR POLICY CORRECTIVE ACTION AND REMEDIATION EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE STATISTICS OUR PHILOSOPHY Kohl's Department Stores is committed to high standards of behavior on issues of social responsibility.
Through our Terms of Engagement ("our Policy"), we hold all of our Vendor Partners to these same high standards.
Our Policy is designed to protect the interests of workers engaged in the manufacture of merchandise procured for Kohl's and we select Vendor Partners who we believe share our commitment to the fair and ethical treatment of employees.
Our compliance philosophy focuses on remediation and continuous improvement.
OUR POLICY Our Policy focuses on compliance with local labor laws, working conditions and spells out Kohl's expectations to our Vendor Partners regarding wages, prohibition of using child or forced labor which includes, without limitation, prison and slave labor or human trafficking for those purposes, respecting the rights of workers to free association, health and safety issues and more.
Our Policy is posted at www.
connection.
kohls.
com ("new vendors" tab).
We contract with numerous Vendor Partners who in turn contract with hundreds of manufacturing facilities worldwide to procure merchandise sold in our stores.
It is critically important to us that each Vendor Partner's manufacturing facility treats its workers fairly and in compliance with our Policy.
We continually monitor social compliance and challenge our Vendor Partners to protect the health, safety and human rights of workers.
Back to Top OVERSIGHT OF OUR POLICY Kohl's organizational structure supports the uniform and objective application of the compliance program to all Vendor Partners.
Corporate Governance personnel are responsible for day-to-day duties and administration of the compliance program and are independent of the Product Development and Merchandising departments who are responsible for development, sourcing and merchandising.
As a result, day-to-day decisions regarding the social compliance status of potential factories, and those factories that are being used to produce merchandise for Kohl's, are made by employees not involved in actual purchase negotiation.
We expect our Vendor partners to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with our Policy in their manufacturing facilities that produce merchandise for us, whether the facility is operated by them or by one of their subcontractors.
We require our Vendor Partners who produce private label and exclusive merchandise for us to identify all manufacturing facilities, domestic and foreign, that they plan to use to produce such merchandise and to provide us with written certification that each facility will operate in compliance with our Policy.
Subcontractors that a Vendor Partner desires to use in the manufacturing process require our approval.
We recognize that publication of a statement of principles is insufficient to achieve compliance with these principles and that aggressive enforcement of our Policy is required.
To achieve this goal, we actively monitor factories in which our merchandise is produced.
We reserve the right to review all Vendor Partner facilities, including the use of unannounced on site inspections of manufacturing facilities.
Factory monitoring visits are performed by professional, independent third party monitors and is ongoing.
Once deemed compliant with our Policy, factories are monitored periodically, based on established risk level.

If noncompliance with Kohl's Policy is identified, we take appropriate action, which, depending on the severity of the deviation, ranges from working with our Vendor Partner to ensure adequate steps are taken to address deficiencies, to canceling affected orders, to terminating our relationship with our Vendor Partner.
Follow-up evaluations are completed to verify subsequent adherence to our Policy.
When possible, we attempt to bring noncompliant facilities into compliance rather than terminate our business relationship.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING We provide training to Vendor Partners on our Policy and our expectation of compliance.
We regularly communicate with our Vendor Partners on compliance issues.
In addition, we conduct numerous individual training sessions for Vendor Partners to promote understanding and compliance with our requirements.
The following topics are reviewed during training sessions: expectations for suppliers, policy definitions, best practices, site verification methods, reporting of facility assessments, remediation methods and compliance improvement.
We also conduct internal training sessions for product development and buying office employees on the requirements of our Policy on a quarterly basis.
We provide relevant Kohl's employees, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.
Vendor Partner Certification of Compliance Kohl's requires direct suppliers to certify compliance with all laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they do business.
Sustainable Apparel Coalition Member Kohl's is a Founding Circle member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition which is a group of leading apparel and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, non-government organizations (NGO's), academic experts and the U.
S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
The coalition is working on a collaborative approach to reduce the social and environmental impacts of apparel and footwear products sourced and sold worldwide.
Better Work Program Participant Kohl's participates in the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) and Better Work Vietnam (BWV) programs, which are International Labour Organization programs focused on strengthening labor standards in export garment industries in specified countries.
Our reliance upon BFC and BWV factory monitoring results helps reduce 'audit fatigue' and factory monitoring costs which provides factory management with more time to focus on corrective action and sustainable, continuous improvement.
Policy Regarding Cotton From Uzbekistan Consistent with our commitment to social responsibility, Kohl's does not knowingly carry products that use cotton originating from any country that condones the use of child labor and/or forced labor.
Kohl's does not source any Private or Exclusive Brand products from Uzbekistan and, to the best of our knowledge; cotton from Uzbekistan is not used in goods produced for Kohl's in other countries.
Until we are convinced that forced child labor is not being used to produce cotton in Uzbekistan, Kohl's specifically prohibits the use of Uzbekistan cotton in the manufacture of merchandise intended for sale in our stores.
Clean Diamonds Trade Act We require our suppliers of diamonds and jewelry to ensure that the merchandise they sell to Kohl's meets the requirements of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act and the Kimberly Process Certification and that this merchandise does not contain conflict diamonds.
