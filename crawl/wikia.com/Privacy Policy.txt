<b>ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO EEA RESIDENTS</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is our justification for handling your personal data?</b>
</p>
<p>Under European data protection laws, we have to ensure that we process your personal information fairly and lawfully.
This means that we must have a "legal basis" for each of our processing activities where they relate to the personal data of an individual within the EEA.
These bases include:

</li>
<li>
<b>Performance of a contract</b> – we may process your data if we are entering into a contract with you, or taking preparatory steps to do so.
</li>

</p>
<p>

</ol>

You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the "Complaints, Questions and Comments" section below.
</p>
<p>We process your personal information collected through the use of Non-Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of our legitimate interests.
