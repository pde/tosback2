<p>If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time.
We will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and marketing, for example).</p>

Friends and Other Zynga Players
<p>Zynga’s games and Services support and often encourage you to interact with other players.

Third-Party Advertising Including Behavioral Advertising and Analytics <p>We’ll share some of your information with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your interests and to enable us to offer some of our Services for free.</p>
<p>We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games, game features, and other Services for free.
These advertisements may include, without limitation, banner ads on game boards or Services themselves, as full-screen ads between moves or games, or through an “offer wall” in which third-party advertisers offer to provide virtual currency or other in-game items to players in exchange for watching an advertisement or for completing a task, such as signing up for an account with one of the advertisers, completing a survey, or finishing a particular game level.
Offer walls are hosted by third-party offer wall providers, and the offers are made by third-party advertisers, not by Zynga.</p>
<p>We do not actively share personal information that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.</p>
<p>To enable advertisers, ad networks, and offer wall providers to serve you with more relevant ads, they may collect, or we may collect and share with them, the following types of information when you use our Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement).
</li>
<li>certain technical information (like IP address, non-persistent device identifier such as IDFA, and de-identified persistent device identifier such as a hashed Android ID).
</li>
<li>a unique identifier, such as your social network ID or Zynga player ID.
and/or
</li>
<li>other contextual data about your game play (like your level and session length).
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to serving you with relevant ads, the information collected may be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>measure how effective ads are.
</li>
<li>offer you targeted advertising (both on and off our Services) in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising).
and/or
</li>
<li>undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.</p>
<p>Please note, after clicking on a third-party advertisement or offer, you may no longer be on a site or app controlled by Zynga or the social network through which you are playing Zynga’s games.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties, please see How to Access, Update, and Manage Your Personal Information.
For more information on controlling the use of cookies and similar technologies, please see our Cookie Notice.
Please note that the practices of third-party companies delivering advertisements on our Services are subject to those companies’ own privacy policies.</p>
Safety, Security, and Compliance with Law <p>We’ll share your information if necessary for safety, security, or compliance with law.</p>
<p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between you and Zynga may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:</p>
<ul>
<li>to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply.
</li>
<li>when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for national security, law enforcement, or legal process purposes (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena).
</li>
<li>when we believe in our sole discretion that our Services are being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions.
</li>
<li>when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person, or the public generally.
and/or
</li>
<li>to protect the rights or property of Zynga or applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service.
</li>
</ul>Third-Party Service Providers <p>We’ll share your information with the third-party service providers and business partners that we work with to bring you our Services.</p>
<p>We will share your information with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, analytics, analysis, hosting services, customer service, marketing, and advertising optimization.
We will also share your information with our third-party business partners who assist us in delivering and optimizing our Services, such as our platform partners (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.).
Where we share your information with third-party service providers and business partners, we ensure that we have appropriate agreements in place to protect your information (as required by applicable data protection laws).</p>
Sale or Merger <p>We’ll share your information with the interested party if we undergo or evaluate undergoing a sale or merger.</p>
<p>In the event that Zynga undergoes or evaluates undergoing a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition.
We will make reasonable efforts to let you and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition before transferring your personal information.</p>
Other Third Parties <p>We may share some of your information with other third parties if we have your consent to do so.</p>
<p>In addition to the sharing described above, we may share your information with other third parties or allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy if we have your consent to do so.</p>

<p>Once Zynga receives your information from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by Zynga in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
You may access and update that information as described above.</p>
Opting Out of Promotional Communications from Zynga <p>You can unsubscribe from promotional emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or visiting our Email Settings page.
You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device’s settings page.
You can opt out of SMS text communications by texting STOP.</p>
<p>If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from Zynga, click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any promotional email from Zynga or visit our Email Settings page.
Your unsubscribe request or e-mail preferences change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer than ten business days.
During that processing period, you may receive additional promotional emails from us.</p>
<p>If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn off push notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.
Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “settings” page.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving SMS text messages by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS text messaging program or by Contacting Us.
When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS text messages, we may send a text message confirming receipt.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the Services you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>
Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising <p>You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile web advertising from third parties, you may visit the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising.
and
</li>
<li>Your Online Choices website for EU-based advertising.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”).
You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by Zynga.
Zynga does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
</p>
<p>Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in Zynga’s Services after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>Our websites and games may contain advertisements from “Third-Party Services,” meaning companies other than Zynga, that may link to their own websites, online services, or mobile applications.

Our Policies Concerning Children <p>We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Countries) (collectively, “Children”).
Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children.</p>
<p>Though our Services do not target Children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain Services.
For users who identify themselves as Children in our age-gate on such Services, if we allow Children to use the Services, we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose “personal information” (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)), except as permitted by COPPA, or obtain legally valid parental consent.</p>
<p>If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.</p>

International Operations and Transfers Out of European Countries <p>When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.
When we transfer, store, and use personal information collected in the European Countries outside of the European Countries, we comply with our legal obligations and ensure that your personal information is subject to suitable safeguards or transferred to “approved” territories.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.</p>
<p>As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our “Affiliated Entities,” which are any other corporate entities under common ownership with Zynga Inc., or to our business partners and service providers from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.
For example, Zynga Inc.
provides certain services to its Affiliated Entities.</p>
<p>We store personal information about players and visitors to our sites on servers located in the United States, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries.
Personal information collected in the European Countries may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Countries.
The data we hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of the European Countries who work for us, one of our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business partners or service providers.
This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details, or (ii) the provision of support services.
When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here.
Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>
<p>The Zynga entities and subsidiaries listed in our Privacy Shield certification record, accessible here are certified under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield, effective as of the date our certification posted here.
We adhere to the relevant Privacy Shield Principles for all personal information received from participating European countries in reliance on the Privacy Shield framework.

PLEASE CONTACT ZYNGA FIRST.</p>

<p>You may exercise any rights you have to correct, amend, or delete information about you as described in Your Rights and How to Access, Update, and Manage Your Personal Information.</p>
<p>When Zynga receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, Zynga has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield, and (ii) Zynga is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
</p>
<p>With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Zynga is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

How Long We Keep Your Information <p>We’ll keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, maintain our legitimate business operations, and/or exercise, defend or establish our rights.</p>
<p>How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.</p>
<p>We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an active account with us.
We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account.

Security of Your Information <p>We work hard to protect your information but you also have a role to play.</p>
<p>We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline and to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.</p>
<p>If you have an account registered directly with Zynga, your profile information is protected by the password you use to access your Zynga account.
It is important that you protect and maintain your Zynga account’s security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account.
If you forget the password to your Zynga account, the Services allow you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password.
If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your Zynga game accounts without your permission.
So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure as well.
We urge you to log out of your Zynga account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.</p>
<p>When you sign into your Zynga account or enter payment information, we and our third-party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.</p>
<p>While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.
We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service.
Any transmission is at your own risk.
If you have questions about the security of our websites, please Contact Us.</p>

Changes to Our Privacy Policy <p>We’ll let you know about any material changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game or on www.zynga.com, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law).
We may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or player forums.
You should periodically check www.zynga.com and this Privacy Policy for updates.</p>
