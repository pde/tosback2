 Oath Community Guidelines <p>Oath is part of the Verizon family of companies and consists of over 50 digital and mobile brands globally, including Yahoo and AOL.
Oath communities include people from a wide variety of experiences, backgrounds, and mindsets and we offer a wide range of products, services and online areas (including email, instant messaging platforms, forums and chat rooms).
These guidelines apply to your use of all of Oath's products and services and will help you and the rest of the Oath community have an enjoyable experience.
Please also look for and follow any additional standards that may apply to specific services. </p>
<p>If you don't feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined below, maybe participating in the Oath community isn't for you.
We've crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Oath community has an enjoyable experience.</p>
<strong>In short</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Be a good citizen.</strong> Interact, connect, and treat others with respect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stay on topic.</strong> Keep your content relevant and moderate it correctly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Know the rules.</strong> Your activity on Oath is subject to these Community Guidelines and the Oath Terms of Service.
If you don't follow these rules, we may take action on your account, which could include warnings, suspension, and/or account termination. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Things to do</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Be respectful.</strong> We're a diverse global community of many types of people, with different beliefs, opinions, sensitivities, and comfort levels.
Please be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members,  consider your audience when posting publicly, and moderate your content where appropriate. </li>
<li>
<strong>Be a good citizen.</strong> You can help shape your online community.
Contribute thoughtful content, report abusive content if you see it, and encourage rich, fulfilling engagement and interactions with others. </li>
<li>
<strong>Moderate your content.</strong> Ensure that what you post or upload is appropriate for the context and community where you're participating and the service you are using.
If you're unsure whether content is appropriate or consistent with the Community Guidelines or the Oath Terms of Service, please err on the side of caution. </li>
<li>
<strong>Share.</strong> Encourage broad discussions and contribute original content and thoughts to your community.
Chances are someone could benefit from your knowledge, opinions, or personal experiences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use your tools.</strong> We offer many tools to help users personalize Oath services, including tools to limit exposure to unwanted content and to report abusive content to Oath's attention.
Know what tools are available in the products you use, and use them to tailor your experience. </li>
<li>
<strong>Protect your data.</strong> Oath encourages you to properly backup your information. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Things <em>not</em> to do</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Don't use hate speech.</strong> Hate speech directly attacks a person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.
As noted above, we're a diverse global community of many types of people, with different beliefs, opinions, sensitivities, and comfort levels.
Please be respectful and keep hateful and incendiary comments off of Oath.
Read these tips for confronting hate speech from the Anti-Defamation League.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't bully or harass members of the community.</strong> Oath communities aren't a place to harass, bully, shame, impersonate, or intimidate others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't forget the children and teens.</strong> Remember that children and teenagers are a part of the community, too.
If you would hesitate to show what you're about to post to a child, your parent, or a stranger on the street, you probably shouldn't post it on Oath.
Think before you post and moderate accordingly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't be obscene.</strong> Sexually explicit and vulgar language and images are not welcome.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't behave maliciously.</strong> Members of Oath communities are not above the law, and they must conduct themselves consistent with our Community Guidelines and the Oath Terms of Service, including the section on Member Conduct.
Don't attempt to defraud, impersonate, threaten, harass or harm another user.
Don't invade another user's privacy or spam another user or the community.
Don't try to trick people into sharing their personal information, steal anything (like copyrighted or trademarked material), or break into places you shouldn't be.
Don't upload viruses or malicious code or post links to sites that contain such things or that interfere with the operation of Oath.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things <em>Oath will do</em>
</strong>
<ul>
<li>Act to promote community, collaboration, and discussion.</li>
<li>Refrain from asking you for your password and full credit card number via email, so that you can be sure that such messages, even if they look like they come from us, are fraudulent.</li>
<li>Remove content and/or deactivate accounts that violate these Community Guidelines or our Oath Terms of Service.
We care greatly about our users and their ability to have safe, rich online experiences.
We cannot be present for every interaction and upload, and we rely on our community of users to report abusive and potentially harmful content to our attention.
When we become aware of a potential violation, if we determine that content violates our policies or applicable law, we will take appropriate action.
We may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic, educational, or documentary considerations, or when there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action.
But there are a few clear lines-we have a zero tolerance policy toward: <ul>
<li>sharing adult or sexualized content of another person without that person's consent (Non-Consensual Pornography).
If you experience this, learn how to report it to our attention;</li>
<li>content that exploits or abuses children, including all child sexual abuse imagery (including  cartoon images) and all content that presents children in a sexual manner.
and</li>
<li>content that promotes or supports violent criminal behavior, organized criminal activity, or acts of terrorism, including content supporting or celebrating terrorist organizations, their leaders, or associated violent activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
