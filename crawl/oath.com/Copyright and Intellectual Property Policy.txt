 Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy <p>Oath respects intellectual property laws and has adopted the following policy toward intellectual property infringement on its Services.</p>
<p>
<u>
<strong>Reporting Instances of Intellectual Property Violations</strong>
</u>
</p>
<p>NOTE: This policy addresses copyright and trademark concerns relating to content accessible on or through Oath’s Services, other than Bing search results.
For copyright or trademark concerns about search results powered by Bing (including, but not limited to, Sponsored Listings and Ads results), please click on the relevant sections under Resources to contact Microsoft directly.</p>
<p>Oath responds to effective and complete notices of intellectual property violations that provide specific information for us to identify and locate the allegedly infringing materials.
In appropriate instances, we will remove allegedly infringing materials.
Upon review, we may decline to remove allegedly infringing materials – for example, if we determine they are not infringing, if we lack adequate information to determine that they are infringing, if we are unable to find the accused materials, or if the materials are protected by the fair use doctrine, among other reasons.</p>
<p>Please note, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), section 512(f), any person that knowingly materially misrepresents that activity is infringing may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney’s fees.
If someone has posted your original work (for example, a photo you took, or an article you wrote) without your permission, you may want to seek legal guidance to find out if your intellectual property rights have been infringed.
Oath is unable to provide you with legal advice regarding copyright, trademark or other intellectual property matters.</p>
