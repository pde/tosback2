 Communication Products <p>This policy describes our current privacy practices for the Verizon Media Communications brands, websites, features, products, apps, software and other services (“Communications Services”).
All information collected, provided to Verizon Media or stored in your Verizon Media Account will be treated, used and protected in accordance with the Verizon Media Privacy Policy.
This information may change as Verizon Media revises these Communications Services by adding or removing features or using different service providers.
Some Communications Service features are only available if you are a registered user.</p>
<p>This page describes specific privacy practices with respect to Yahoo Address Book, Yahoo Calendar, Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Messenger or other instant messaging services and Yahoo Notepad.</p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use Practices - General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Verizon Media’s systems may analyze and store all communications content, including email content from incoming and outgoing mail, as well as incoming and outgoing messages to messaging apps.</li>
<li>We also may analyze and store all other content and other information you provide when you use our Communications Services.
This can include information within or about the content you provide, such as photos, attachments and other communications.</li>
<li>Our systems may analyze all communications content (such as Mail, Groups, Calendar, Address and Messenger content including instant messages and SMS messages) for the purposes outlined in our main Privacy Policy page.
If you provide Verizon Media access to your Gmail data, please click here for more information on how we treat your Gmail data.</li>
<li>This analysis may occur on all communications content as it is sent, received, and when it is stored, including content from services synced with your account.
For example, in certain use cases, we run automated algorithms on commercial communications to create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to identify the elements of an airline receipt).
These templates do not include the recipient’s personal data.
Verizon Media employees may review the templates to improve our services and our personalization of your experience.
We may also manually review certain communications to improve our masking template capabilities, develop tools to assist the automated scanning process, improve segmentation and other automated functions and create generic templates of such documents (e.g., using common language to identify the elements of an airline receipt).
Our anti-spam team may review messages flagged as “spam” or “not spam” to improve our anti-spam defenses.</li>
<li>Our Communications Service may include interactive features from third-parties as well.
We do not share information that personally identifies you (such as information like your first and last name or email address) with the third-parties without your consent.</li>
<li>This information may also be used for interest-based advertising.
To learn more, you can visit Verizon Media’s control tool for interest-based advertising.</li>
<li>Please read the FAQ to learn more about our Communications Services.</li>

<strong>Communication Features</strong>

</ul>
<strong>Sharing and Disclosure to Third-Parties</strong>
