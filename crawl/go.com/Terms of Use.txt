<u>SUBMISSIONS</u>
</b>
<p>
</p>
In these terms of use, we use the word "<b>Submissions</b>" to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, "<b>Distribute</b>") on or through a WDIG Site.
<p>
</p>
There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions.
"<b>Solicited Submissions</b>" means those Submissions (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity on a WDIG Site for our review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or compensation (collectively, "<b>Consideration</b>") (such as prizes or other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions).
and (b) that you Distribute on or through any WDIG Site for which you do not seek Consideration (such as in our Guest Services and in Public Forums (as defined below in Section 6, entitled "PUBLIC FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION")).
"<b>Unsolicited Submissions</b>" are any and all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph.
<p>
</p>
<b>DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS.
NO IMPLIED CONTRACT.</b>
<p>
</p>
Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through any WDIG Sites.
We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
We therefore ask that you not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission.
In any event, you agree that any Submissions you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated Consideration)..
<p>
</p>
Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions.
Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission.
