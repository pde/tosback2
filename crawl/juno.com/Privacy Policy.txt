If you choose to obtain products or services from such third parties, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other website from whom you request products or services.

For example, cookies keep track of your preferences, what Sites or other websites you visit, any personalization you may have done, any passwords you have elected to be remembered, and they may also measure whether you've seen or interacted with an advertisement on our Sites or other sites.
Cookies (or similar technological methods) also allow us, our Affiliates and our third party partners to serve you with advertisements including targeted advertisements when you are on or off the Sites.
Cookies may be set on your browser when you visit our Sites, or when you open emails from us.

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movement of users.
Web beacons help us and our third party partners better manage content delivery by informing us when you are on our Sites and what content is effective.
We also use web beacons in our emails to let us know which emails you have opened.

<b>III.
Targeted Advertising, Email &amp.
Opt-Outs</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
<b>A.
Targeted Advertising Opt-Outs:</b>
<br> We may display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites based on information we obtain from you, about you, and/or from third parties.
<br>
<br> We work with advertisers, agencies, and other companies that connect advertisers to the Internet (collectively, "<b>Advertisers</b>") in order to display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites.
These advertisements are targeted based on information that we or third parties may have collected about you such as demographic information (gender, age, general geographic location, etc.) as well as behavioral information.
Behavioral information is information about your preferences that is collected or inferred based on, among other things, online data such as the URLs or websites you visit and searches you perform, and offline data such as your purchases and subscriptions.
<br>
<br>
We and our Advertisers may use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content.
for example, web beacons may enable us or our Advertisers to recognize your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.
In addition, a unique third party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.
<br>
<br>
You may opt out of targeted advertising from many Advertisers by exercising your choice here.
Please note that although you may opt out of targeted advertising, you may continue to see advertisements.
these advertisements may not, however, be as relevant to you as targeted advertisements.
<br>
<br>
If you choose to opt out of receiving targeted advertising, please note that the opt-out tools accessed here are specific to the browser and computer, mobile device or other similar device you are using at the time you opt out.
Your opt-out choice cannot be honored if you access our Sites using a different browser on this computer, mobile device or other similar device, or if you access our Sites from a different device.
Also, since the opt-out tools involve placing a special cookie on your browser, your opt-out choice cannot be honored if all cookies on your device(s) are deleted.
As a result, you should repeat this opt-out process with each browser and device you use to access the Sites and Services and whenever cookies are deleted from your device(s).
Juno has no control over any opt-out tool offered by others and cannot guarantee the performance of such tools.
<br>
<br>
Instead of using the cookie-based opt-out tools described above, you may also choose to not allow cookies to be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device by modifying your web browser settings.
Each browser is different, so make sure to check each browser's user guide to learn how to change your cookie preferences for each browser.
If you choose to reject cookies, however, you may not be able to automatically access products and services offered by us that require a user "login" or "sign in." In addition, any cookie-based opt-out tools may not be implemented on your device.
<br>
<br>
Please see Section I.D.
of this Policy for more information on technological methods of data collection such as cookies and web beacons.
<br>
<br>
<b>B.
Email Opt-Outs:</b>
<br> You may receive email advertisements and promotions from us, our Affiliates and our Advertisers regarding products or services we believe you may be interested in, new features or products we are introducing, or other promotions.
If you decide that you wish to cease receiving such email, you may do so at any time by following the opt-out instructions in the email.
<br>
<br>
Since it is necessary for us to contact you regarding certain matters, you may not opt out of receiving messages related to material company announcements or policy changes, or administrative matters relating to your account, like billing, collections, customer service or similar matters.
<br>
<br>
If you subscribe to a free or discounted version of a Service, you acknowledge that as a condition of receiving such free or discounted Service, you are required to receive information and advertising solicitations from third party Advertisers.
You may opt out of receiving such communications from the Advertiser by following the instructions provided by the Advertiser.
These solicitations are a condition of receiving the free or discounted Service and you agree that if you opt out of receiving these solicitations you are required to terminate the relevant Service.
</blockquote>
<b>IV.
How We Keep Your Information Secure</b>
<br>
<br>
We use secure socket layer ("<b>SSL</b>") technology to protection your information.
SSL encrypts your order information as additional protection against the decoding of that information by anyone other than us.
However, despite all reasonable security precautions and processes, such as password protection, encryption technology, and use of firewall technology, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect all information we collect and process, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Sites, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we will take commercially reasonable precautions to protect its security on our systems.
<br>
<br>
<b>V.
Minors' Use of the Services</b>
<br>
<br>
Juno believes it is important for parents and guardians to participate in and monitor their children's use of the Internet.
Juno offers general audience Sites and Services and these Sites and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13.
If we have actual knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we require the parent or guardian to provide parental consent as required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<b>COPPA</b>").
Juno will not use or disclose PII from children under 13 except as may be permitted under COPPA.
