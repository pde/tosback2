Personal information
<p>In general, you can visit Lenovo on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself.
There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.</p>
<p>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations.
For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription.
You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Lenovo that you wish to be considered for.
We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you.
if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.
(See “Choice” below).
If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Using and Sharing Personal Information<p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Lenovo may use your personal information and with whom we may share it.
Depending on the type of Lenovo Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply.
For example, if you order a product from a Lenovo Web site, your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your Transaction Request and Marketing Use.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Fulfilling your transaction request
<p>If you request something from a Lenovo Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request.
To help us do this, we may share information with others including other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo's Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment.
These types of service providers are prohibited from using this information to market to you directly.
In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys and contests on our site.
If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to administer the contest or survey.
We will use your contact information to communicate with you regarding Lenovo products if you give permission.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.
That company is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Marketing Use<p>The information you provide to Lenovo on certain Lenovo Web sites may also be used by Lenovo and selected third parties for marketing purposes.
Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Communications from the Site
<p>Special Offers and Updates: You may choose to have us send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions.
You can sign up for these email updates in various areas on our sites.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.
Please see the "Choice" section below.</p>
<p>Newsletters: If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.
Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.
Please see the "Choice" section.</p>
<p>Service-related Announcements: We may send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>
<p>Customer Service: Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.
We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p>Email A Page: If you choose to use our referral service to email a page about our site to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.
Lenovo does not retain this information going-forward, except as authorized by the recipient.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Choice
<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.
For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form or in "My Account" on your preferences page.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by using our short Privacy Submission Form.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Live Chat<p>In some contexts, you may elect to chat with us to obtain assistance.
If our live chat is offline we will collect your name and email address so that we may reply to your request.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews<p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.
We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at Privacy Submission Form.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Lenovo Human Resources Web Sites (including Recruitment)<p>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on a Lenovo Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae.
We may use this information throughout Lenovo and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.
Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Information for Business Partners<p>If you represent a Lenovo Business Partner, you may visit a Lenovo Web site intended specifically for Lenovo Business Partners.
We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and Lenovo Business Partners generally.
For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of Lenovo Business Partner programs.
It may also include sharing certain information with other Business Partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Lenovo customers or prospects.
In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Lenovo Supplier Administration<p>If you represent a Lenovo supplier, you may visit a Lenovo Web site intended specifically for use by Lenovo suppliers.
We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you.
For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of Lenovo, Lenovo's Business Partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions, postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment.
It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent and/or other Lenovo suppliers generally.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Lenovo Discussion Forums, Blogs, and Chat Rooms<p>If you participate in a Lenovo discussion forum, blog, or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Lenovo, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room.
Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Lenovo.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at Privacy Submission Form.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Other Lenovo Web Site Notices<p>In some cases, specific Lenovo Web sites may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Our Worldwide Practices<p>Lenovo is a global organization with legal entities, business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders.
In conducting our business with you, whether it is sales, warranty service, marketing communications or other requested services, we may transfer your information to any country in which we do business and may provide it to entities acting on our behalf.
Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, wherever it may be stored and used, in compliance with all applicable laws and with this privacy policy.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Information Security and Quality
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID,) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Data Retention<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at Privacy Submission Form.
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Supplementing Information<p>From time to time we may supplement information you give us via a Lenovo Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses.
This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Use of Suppliers<p>In some cases Lenovo uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf.
It is Lenovo's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Lenovo's policies and these third parties may not use your information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Mergers and Acquisitions<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Lenovo decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.
It is Lenovo's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
<p>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service.
For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Lenovo Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable.
This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Lenovo or others on Lenovo's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</p>
<p>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data.
This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns.
This information is not reviewed at an individual level.
If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.</p>
<p>Lenovo may collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies".
A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you.
Some Lenovo pages use cookies, sent by Lenovo or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site.
We have no access or control of third party tracking technologies.
You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.
If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.</p>
<p>Some Lenovo Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service.
These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Lenovo's Web sites.
When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers.
These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.
If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.</p>
<p>If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.
For more information, please see "How to work with Cookies".</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Flash LSOs
<p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

Please be aware that it is Lenovo's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Online Advertising<p>Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads.
These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers.
After it is collected the information is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual.
If, however, you would prefer that these companies not collect such information, please visit www.networkadvertising.org and follow the "opt-out" instructions.</p>
 <b>Back to top</b> Personalized URL Link
<p>On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors.
If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Lenovo and information you have provided to us.
While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests.
An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.</p>
<p>If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let Lenovo collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with Lenovo.
If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.</p>  <b>Back to top</b> Disclosures Required By Law<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
