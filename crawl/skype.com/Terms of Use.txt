<strong>Key Points</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document.
There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:</p>
<p>
<strong>NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: </strong>The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone.
In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype’s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services.
You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE: </strong>In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Software.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS:</strong> If Skype allocates you an Online Number or Skype To Go Number, you do not own number or have a right to retain that number forever.
Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time.
You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Online Number or Skype To Go Number to anyone else.
You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing an Online Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn.
Please see also paragraph 19.1.</p>
<p>
<strong>SKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS:</strong> If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>5.4 Suspension, technical improvement and maintenance:</strong> From time to time, Skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the Software, Products or Skype Websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the Software, Products or Skype Websites.
This may require Skype to temporarily suspend or limit your use of some or all of the Software, Products or Skype Websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed.
To the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, Skype will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the Skype Website in advance.
You will not be entitled to claim damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of any Software, Product or Skype Website.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.5 No Access to Emergency Services:</strong> Neither the Products nor the Software are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (‘Emergency Services’) .
There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Products.
You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skype is not required to offer access to Emergency Services under any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law.
(ii) it is your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Products, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (iii) the Software and the Products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service.

<p>
<strong>5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only and Not Applicable to the Qik Software)</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.6.1</strong> In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect.
Click here for the listing of countries (‘Enabled Countries’) and software versions and other platforms (‘Enabled Versions’) that enable limited Skype emergency calling.
Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms.
You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype’s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort.
In particular, please also note that:</p>
<p>(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services.
Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection.
</p>
<p>(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.
</p>
<p>(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you.
If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software.
Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.</p>
<p>(iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using Skype’s APIs, any of Skype’s software development kits or otherwise).</p>
<p>
<strong>5.6.2</strong> In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)).
It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes.
Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world.
Where limited emergency calling is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance.
If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software.
If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.7 Content of Communications:</strong> Skype is not the source of, does not verify or endorse and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made using the Software.
By using the Software, you agree that any content that you submit may be transmitted to the recipient of your communication.
The content of communications is entirely the responsibility of the person from whom such content originated.
You therefore may be exposed to content that is offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, indecent or otherwise objectionable.
The content of communications may be protected by intellectual property rights, which are owned by third parties.
You are responsible for the content you choose to communicate and access using the Software.
In particular, you are responsible for ensuring that you do not submit material that is (i) copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner (ii) a falsehood or misrepresentation (iii) offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, defamatory, libellous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, or is otherwise objectionable.
(iv) an advertisement or solicitation of business.
or (v) impersonating another person.
Skype reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to review content for the purpose of enforcing these Terms.
Skype may in its sole discretion block, prevent delivery of or otherwise remove the content of communications as part of its effort to protect the Software, Products or its customers, or otherwise enforce these Terms.
Further, Skype may in its sole discretion remove such content and/or terminate these Terms and your User Account if you use any content that is in breach of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.8 Notice and Take-Down</strong> If Skype receives any notification that any material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the Skype Website or through the Software (excluding your private communications) (“<strong>User Submission</strong>”) is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third party, or if Skype wishes to remove your User Submission for any reason whatsoever, Skype reserves the right to automatically remove such User Submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may be decided from time to time by Skype in its sole discretion.

<strong>5.13 Linking</strong> You may link to the Skype Website from another website owned by you, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it.

</p>
<p>
<strong>8.3 Promotional Offers:</strong> From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period.
Skype reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Skype determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.4 Tax:</strong> 15% Luxembourg VAT generally applies if you are located in the EU and if you don’t have a VAT registration number.
Skype reserves the right to apply VAT at the appropriate rate as per VAT rules applicable at the time of purchase.
8% Swiss VAT applies if you are located in Switzerland.
Other local taxes may apply in certain countries.
If you are located in the EU and if you have a VAT registration number, you are liable to self-assess VAT in your country at the appropriate rate as per the reverse charge rules applicable in your country.
When you purchase a voucher or pre-paid card, depending on the country, 15% Luxembourg VAT, local VAT or other taxes may apply and may be deducted from the value of the voucher or prepaid card upon redemption.
Your Skype Credit balance is displayed exclusive of any such taxes.
The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended.

The Skype Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Skype Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher).
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.2 Inactive Skype Credit.</strong> If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Skype Credit that has been allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator) Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status.
You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate.
Reactivated Skype Credit is not refundable.
If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase.
You are not permitted to use any Skype Credit on or after the date of its expiry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.3 Other payment methods.</strong> Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products.
Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you.
Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.4 Recurring Payments.</strong> Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.
</p>
<p>

<p>(a) The Auto-Recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Skype Credit, unless you untick the appropriate box.
Your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account.
For example, if you purchase 10 Euros of Skype Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be 10 Euros of Skype Credit.
In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time.
If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box.
</p>
<p>(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription.</p>
<p>(c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account.</p>

<p>Subject to this FUP, Skype’s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers).
Unlimited calls to mobiles may also be included where stated at the time of purchase.

<p>Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination.
Skype may at its option, terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this FUP or Skype’s Terms of Use.
Where reasonable, Skype will provide you with notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription and, if appropriate, Skype may offer you an alternative subscription.
</p>
<p>(b) Skype reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any time.
If Skype changes the Products included in your subscription, Skype will notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date.
If you do not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take effect.
</p>
