It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Business Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data.
Neither Skype nor its officers, employees or Affiliates may be held liable whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability for any claim, damage, or loss arising from or relating to any failure by You, Your Administrators and/or Business Users to comply with this paragraph 3.5.3.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.6 Administrator(s)</strong>

You shall procure that all Administrators read, agree to and comply with this Agreement, the Business TOS and any other applicable Additional Terms, and You shall be responsible for any breach of the Terms by such Administrator(s).
If you are an Administrator creating or managing a Skype Manager but not entering into this Agreement on behalf of a legally incorporated entity or you are not authorized to represent or act on behalf of such entity, then you shall be in breach of this Agreement and shall be personally liable for such breach and any other breach of this Agreement, and for any acts and omissions of any Business Users or Administrators on your Skype Manager.
