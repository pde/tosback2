Any Online Numbers and Skype Credit that You have allocated to that Business Account may be taken back to the Skype Manager and reallocated before the Business Account is deleted.
You may take the Online Numbers back by manually removing them from the Business Account.

It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Business Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data.
