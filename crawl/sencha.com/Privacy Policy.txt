This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to identify defects, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
IP addresses may be tied to personally identifiable information to identify your location or similar characteristics.
We use a third-party tracking service that may use cookies, log files, or other technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies on this site.
We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
We may use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site.
Some of our business partners (e.g., our analytics provider) may use cookies on our site.
We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any such firm.</p> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) <p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
Although the administrators and moderators of Sencha Forums will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off, it is impossible for us to review all messages.
All messages express the views of the author, and neither the owners of Sencha Forums, nor vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

You will be notified via prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p> Changes in this Privacy Statement <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
