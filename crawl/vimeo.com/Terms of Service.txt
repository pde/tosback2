<p>
<strong>Overview:</strong> Arbitration provides a private dispute resolution process that is usually more streamlined and less formal than litigation.
In an arbitration, your rights will be determined by a neutral third party called an arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.
Both you and Vimeo are entitled to fundamentally fair proceedings at every stage of the arbitration, including the hearing.
The arbitrator will decide all issues relating to the dispute, including the question of arbitrability, and can grant any relief that a court could grant.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</p>
<p>
<strong>Definitions:</strong> A “<strong>Covered Privacy Claim</strong>” means any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to (a) Vimeo’s collection, use, storage, analysis, or transfer of your Personal Information.
(b) an alleged breach of our Privacy Policy.
(c) an alleged data breach or unauthorized disclosure of data or content.
or (d) an allegation that Vimeo failed to comply with any privacy or data security right or obligation.
“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information about you, including your registration information (e.g., email address), payment information, location information, device information, biometric identifiers or information, IP address, and your activities (including viewing and search history), but does not include content that you upload (except to the extent the content contains personal information about you).</p>
<p>
<strong>Small Claims Court Exception:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, each party has the right to bring an individual Covered Privacy Claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 1 of JAMS’ Minimum Consumer Standards.
If one party files an arbitration that could be litigated in such a small claims court, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court.
If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.
If requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall administratively close the arbitration so long as the proceedings are at an early stage and no hearing has occurred.</p> 12.
General Provisions <p>
<strong>Reservation of Rights, Severability:</strong> Vimeo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.
Vimeo’s rights and remedies are cumulative.
No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right.
