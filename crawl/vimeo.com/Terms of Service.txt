Subscriptions and Purchases <p>
<strong>SUBSCRIPTIONS:</strong> In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer paid subscriptions.
Please see our subscription pages for current features and pricing.
Features and prices are subject to change.
Storage limits are calculated based upon source files.
We reserve the right to charge for excessive use of bandwidth where plays occur on third-party sites and applications outside the native Vimeo player or apps.
Anyone who wishes to obtain storage capacity beyond what is offered with a particular subscription, or additional bandwidth for applications not using the Vimeo player may request a custom account by contacting us here: join.vimeo.com/custom.
Additional terms and conditions (to be shown prior to purchase) apply to custom accounts.
All fees may be subject to taxes.</p>
<p>
<strong>CANCELATION AND REFUNDS:</strong> Users who purchase annual subscriptions have thirty (30) days after their purchase to cancel and receive a full refund.
Users who purchase monthly subscriptions have five (5) days after purchase to cancel and receive a full refund.
In the case of Live subscription products, refunds are not available if the user has exceeded the storage or bandwidth threshold set forth in the refund policy presented at the time of purchase.
After the cancelation period ends, all purchases are final and all fees paid are non-refundable, even if your account is later terminated by Vimeo.
If your account is terminated due to your breach of this Agreement during the relevant cancelation period, you will not be refunded.
If you have questions, please contact us.</p>
<p>
<strong>RENEWALS:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, you may choose to renew your subscription at the end of the subscription period.
By default, all subscriptions are set to automatically renew for the same period of time as the original subscription.
You may decline to renew at any time prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription.
Vimeo reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for any reason.
Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription periods.</p>
<p>
<strong>END OF SUBSCRIPTION:</strong> When a paid subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a Basic (free) account and Vimeo may disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits.
If you're using Vimeo for commercial purposes, you will need to maintain a Vimeo PRO or higher plan to continue hosting your videos.
Your account and its content may be deleted if your subscription is not renewed.</p>
