<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of all products, services and websites offered by AT&amp;T and our AT&amp;T affiliates, such as DIRECTV, unless they have a different privacy policy.
Because some apps, including some AT&amp;T and DTV branded apps, require additional information, or use information in different ways, they may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and conditions.
These apps may also offer you additional choices for managing your personal information.</p>
