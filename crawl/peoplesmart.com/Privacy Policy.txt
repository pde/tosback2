This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>

Cookies enhance your experience at the Site, and are in many instances necessary for the provision of Member Services.

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

<p>When you download and use the PeopleSmart Background Check App, we also may collect your mobile device’s unique identification number.
We will not collect any precise geolocation information from you or your mobile device unless you expressly consent to such collection.</p>

<p>All communications with us or our authorized agents may be monitored or recorded.</p> Notice for California Residents <p> In addition to the above, the following, intended solely for California residents, concerns our handling of certain personally identifiable and/or personal information as required by the California Online Privacy Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act (collectively, "CCPA").
If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights where some of your "Public" and "Personal" information is concerned.
If applicable, you may have the right to request that we disclose to you categories and specific pieces of Public information we may have obtained from public data sources and Personal information we may have collected directly from you, if any, and delete such, where required.
Please note that we never sell Personal information obtained from you under any circumstances.
</p> Categories of personal information we obtain, collect and/or disclose for business purposes: <p> Various methods for submitting requests are referenced above, as well as the specific types of Public information we obtain from publicly available data sources and/or Personal information we collect directly from our users.
Per CCPA, in response to verified requests for disclosure, we will provide those "categories" of information we obtain or collect.
The categories we have obtained or directly collected are: identifiers (such as name, address, email address).
general geolocation information (e.g., your city and state).
and/or other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
We may disclose these categories of information about you or your use of the Site for business purposes (as defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law.
</p> How categories of Personal information could be used: <p> We and our service providers may use the categories of Personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various aforedescribed business purposes and/or as required by law.
Please see the relevant sections above for more information.
</p> Sale of Public information: <p> CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information.
We do not sell Personal information obtained from our site's visitors or subscribers, such as a name or email address provided when subscribing to our Site (unless such information happens to also be publicly available "Public" information that was NOT obtained from such visitors or subscribers but was instead obtained from publicly available data sources independent of anything visitors or subscribers may have provided us).
As permitted by law and CCPA regulatory guidance, we may need to share certain limited information about your activity, for example through cookies (see above), with third parties in certain instances--you can control these cookies through browser settings--but this limited sharing would not constitute a sale of Personal information.
</p> Non-discrimination for exercising your rights: <p> In addition to including information as to how you can exercise your rights under CCPA, please note that we will never discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA or any other rights.
We will not deny you any access or service, charge you a different price, whether via a discount or other benefit, or impose fees or penalties, provide a different level of service, or the like (though CCPA permits such practices in some scenarios).
CCPA permits companies to offer certain incentives that might result in different prices, rates or quality levels, but any CCPA-permitted financial incentive should reasonably relate to your information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects and participation in any such financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
We do not engage in any such practices.
</p> Authorized Agents: <p> You may authorize another person to submit a request on your behalf.
Please note that before completing any requests, and in addition to our identification verification process, we are required to verify that your agent has been properly authorized to request information on your behalf and this may take additional time to fulfill your request.
</p>
<p> Upon receipt of a verifiable request, CCPA provides some California residents with such additional rights as follows: </p> Right to Know.
You may have the right to know and see the categories of data we have obtained, collected or shared about you over the past 12 months (or if we have not done so), including: <ul>
<li> the categories of Personal information we collected about you, or disclosed about you for a business purpose.
</li>
<li> the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.
</li>
<li> the business or commercial purpose for collecting, obtaining or selling your personal information.
</li>
<li> the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information.
and </li>
<li> the specific items of Personal information we have collected or Public information we have obtained about you.
</li>
</ul>
<p> To begin your Right-to-Know request, please email us at ccpa@beenverified.com or contact us via the phone number or postal address listed above.
We will respond within 10 days of receipt with instructions for continuing your Right-to-know request, including any additional information needed concerning yourself so that we may search for applicable Personal information collected or Public information obtained that pertains to You.
The information you provide must sufficiently match the information in our database to permit us to verify your request.
An authorized agent may also make a request on your behalf.
</p>
<p> We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five days of receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
</p> Right to Delete.
You may have the right to request that we delete information we have obtained regarding, or collected directly from, you (and ask our service providers to do the same).
However, we cannot delete Personal information that we are under a legal obligation to maintain and there are a number of other exceptions that include, but are not limited to, when the information is necessary for us or a third party to do any of the following: <ul>
<li> complete and process your transaction.
</li>
<li> provide you with a product or service.
</li>
<li> perform a contract between us and you.
</li>
<li> protect your security and prosecute those responsible for breaching it.
</li>
<li> fix our system in the case of a bug.
</li>
<li> protect your or other users’ free speech rights.
</li>
<li> comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 et seq.).
</li>
<li> engage in public/peer-reviewed research in the public interest, adhering to all applicable ethics and privacy laws.
</li>
<li> comply with a legal obligation.
or </li>
<li> make other internal and lawful uses of information compatible with the context in which you provided it.
</li>
</ul>
<p> To begin your Right-to-Delete request, please email us at ccpa@beenverified.com or contact us via the phone number or postal address listed above.
</p> Right to ask us not to sell (also known as the right to opt-out).
<p> As explained above, we do not sell Personal information obtained from our site's visitors or subscribers, such as a name or email address provided when subscribing to our Site (unless such information happens to also be publicly available "Public" information that was NOT obtained from such visitors or subscribers but was instead obtained from publicly available data sources independent of anything visitors or subscribers may have provided us).
As for the Public information obtained from publicly available data sources, for many years now, we have accommodated requests to opt-out/not to sell/share such information, which can be done in various locations on the Site.
For your convenience, you may also email us at ccpa@beenverified.com or contact us via the phone number or postal address listed above to request that we not sell and opt-out your Public information.
While we will not sell such Public information that has been opted-out, we reserve the right to disclose Public information to third parties, without notice to you, if required to do so by law, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (i) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety.
(ii) comply with legal process served on us.
or (iii) protect and defend our rights or property.
We also reserve the right to transfer Public information to any successor-in-interest to our business.
</p> In summary: <p> At no cost, you may request information each year regarding any disclosure of your Public or Personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.
To request access to or deletion of your information, or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the methods set forth above.
