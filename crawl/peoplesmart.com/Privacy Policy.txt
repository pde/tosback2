This privacy policy is for visitors and registered users ("you") of PeopleSmart.com (the "website" or "service"), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc.
(“Inflection”, "we" or "our"): </p>
<p> This policy discusses what information the site collects, how we use it, and the limited circumstances in which we may share it.
