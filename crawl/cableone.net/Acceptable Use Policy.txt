</p>
<p>
<strong>How Does Cable One address inappropriate content and transmissions?</strong>
</p>
<p> There may be content on the Internet or otherwise available through the Services which may be offensive to some individuals, or which may not be in compliance with all federal, state and local laws, regulations and other rules.
For example, it is possible to obtain access to content which is harassing, threatening, intimidating, pornographic or offensive, particularly to children.
Cable One does not assume any responsibility for the content contained on the Internet or otherwise available through the Services.
You must assume the risk of accessing content through the Service and Cable One shall not have any liability for any claims, losses, actions, damages, suits or proceedings arising out of or otherwise relating to access to such content.

Cable One does not have any obligation to monitor transmissions made on the Services.
However, Cable One does have the right to monitor such transmissions from time to time and to disclose the same in accordance with your subscriber agreement.
By using the Services to reproduce, publish, display, transmit and distribute content, a user is warranting that the content complies with this Policy and authorizing Cable One to reproduce, publish, display, transmit and distribute such content as necessary for Cable One to deliver the content in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What requirements apply to Electronic Mail?</strong>
</p>
<p> The Services may not be used to or distribute e-mail or other forms of communications in violation of the "Prohibited Uses and Activities" described above.

Moreover, unsolicited email may not direct the recipient to any web site or other resource which uses the Services.
You may not create a username or email address that, in the sole judgment of Cable One, is pornographic, patently offensive or misleading.
You may not reference the Cable One network (e.g., by including "Organization: Cable One " in the header or by listing an IP address that belongs to the Cable One network) in any unsolicited email even if that email is not sent through the Cable One network.
In the event that Cable One believes in its sole discretion that any subscriber name, account name, or e-mail address (collectively, an "identifier") on the Service may be used for, or is being used for, any misleading, fraudulent, or other improper or illegal purpose, Cable One (i) reserves the right to block access to and prevent the use of any of these identifiers, and (ii) may at any time require any customer to change his or her identifier.
Cable One may at any time reserve any identifiers on the Service for Cable One's own purposes.

</p> III.
NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND LIMITATIONS ON BANDWIDTH CONSUMPTION <p> The Cable One network is designed for typical usage by a typical residential computer user.
Computer activity resulting in excessive or sustained bandwidth consumption may burden the network and such usage may be restricted.
Bandwidth on our network is a limited, shared resource among subscribers.
Because we seek to provide the Service at a reasonable cost to the largest number of users, the use of our network is subject to usage limitations.
Users therefore must comply with the current bandwidth, data throughput, and other limitations on the Service, including the excessive use guidelines described below.
Users must ensure their activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other user's use of the Service, nor represent (in the sole but reasonable judgment of Cable One) an unusually large burden on the network itself.
In addition, users must ensure that their activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Cable One's ability to deliver the Service and monitor the Services, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One manage its Network?</strong>
</p>
<p> Cable One strives to provide customers the best experience when using our network, a shared resource among hundreds of thousands of customers.
</p>
<p> Cable One may use tools and techniques to manage its network, deliver the Service, and ensure compliance with this Policy and the Subscriber Agreement.
These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the network and its usage, and can and do change frequently.
For example, these network management activities may include (i) identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer e-mail accounts, (ii) detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, (iii) limiting speeds during periods of extended congestion, (iv) requiring an upgrade or purchase of a different Internet service and (v) using other tools or techniques that Cable One may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best broadband Internet experience to all its customers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One track usage?</strong>
</p>
<p> We collect data on customer traffic pattern usage through the use of traffic management software.
Cable One reserves the right to conduct tests to improve network security, to enhance the performance of our network, and to determine whether to make available new service offerings.
These technical tests are performed almost continuously and without notice.
</p>
<p> Users may also monitor their bandwidth usage in the MyBandwidth section of http://myaccount.cableone.net <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is Excessive Use?</strong>
</p>
<p> Excessive use means bandwidth or data usage that is significantly higher than typical usage for which our network is designed.
Excessive Users consume so much data that their usage could negatively impact the Service provided to other customers.
</p>
<p> In order to ensure an optimized Internet experience for all customers, data plans have been assigned to many Internet services plans: </p> Plan name Data limit Lite Plan 50GB Data Plan 1.5,Mbps, 5Mbps, 8Mbps, 10Mbps,12Mbps 300GB Data Plan Starter Plan 300GB Data Plan Family Plan 600GB Data Plan Streamer &amp.

<p>
<strong>Data Policy</strong>
</p>
<p> Customers who exceed the above data plan 3 or more times in a rolling 12 month period may be required to upgrade to an Internet speed/plan that contains a larger data plan more suitable for their usage.
The plan will be determined on the average of the months which customer usage exceeded their data plan and a customer must remain at the new plan for a minimum of 3 months.
Customers will be notified via email and in-browser notifications and may monitor their data plan usage online at https://myaccount.cableone.net.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How does Cable One address Excessive Use or uncharacteristic use?</strong>
</p>
<p> The Cable One residential service offering is a consumer product designed for personal use of the Internet.
Therefore, if Cable One in its sole but reasonable discretion determines that a customer has exceeded the Excessive Use threshold or is using the Service in a manner significantly uncharacteristic of a typical residential user, Cable One reserves the right to (a) adjust, suspend or terminate Service accounts at any time and without notice.
or (b) require the user to upgrade his service level or pay additional fees in accordance with Cable One's then-current, applicable rates and charges for such Service.
or (c) use any technology to be chosen by Cable One at its sole discretion to slow the user's service for purposes of conserving bandwidth and/or (d) require customers to utilize a specific modem(s) that provide efficient use of the network.
.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What activities may cause excessive bandwidth consumption and uncharacteristic use?</strong>
</p>
<p> Common activities that may cause excessive bandwidth consumption in violation of this Policy include, but are not limited to, numerous or continuous bulk transfers of files and other high capacity traffic using (i) file transfer protocol ("FTP"), (ii) peer-to-peer applications, and (iii) newsgroups, whether provided by Cable One or a third party.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What services are not available to Residential service users?</strong>
</p>
<p> The Service does not provide the type of security, upstream performance and total downstream throughput capability typically associated with commercial use.

Such actions include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Services.
Cable One will not have any liability for any such responsive actions.
The above described actions are not Cable One's exclusive remedies and Cable One may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.

</p> V.
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS <p>
<strong>Cable Modems</strong>
</p>
<p> Cable One strives to produce a high level of reliability, stability and security for our High Speed Internet Subscribers.
The cable modem is a critical network element which we constantly evaluate for compatibility and performance.
Due to technical limitations, changes to our network, discontinued support by manufacturers, regulatory obligations, or defects, certain cable modem models that previously were certified may be deemed to no longer be suitable for our network.
If you own your modem and in our sole but reasonable discretion it becomes unsuitable for any of these or other reasons, it will be your responsibility to purchase a new modem.
Cable One's support web site maintains a current list of certified modems for use on its network.
Cable One reserves the right to upgrade, via software download and without subscriber notification, all cable modems currently connected to its network.
Effective October 1, 2015, only DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 Modems and EMTAs will be compatible with our network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communication</strong>
</p>
<p> Cable One may choose to communicate with you regarding these policies using a variety of methods including email to your Cable One email address or in-browser notices.
In-browser notices are an effective way to quickly alert you to important service-impacting issues.
These notices may require you to acknowledge receipt of the message or log into your Cable One account for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limitations of Liability</strong>
</p>
<p> Cable One will make reasonable efforts to provide customer with uninterrupted and error-free service.
Nonetheless, there are numerous factors that could affect the Service.
Temporary interruptions of the Service may occur as normal events in the provision of the Service.
Cable One reserves the right to interrupt the Service usually between the hours of 1am to 5am (MST or Local) for maintenance purposes.
Also understand that Cable One has no control over the networks, facilities or services of third parties and that delays and disruptions involving them are completely beyond Cable One's control.
As to Cable One's own equipment and software, failure may occur without warning due to causes ranging from our own errors to malicious attack.
If you have requirements that substantially exceed the average consumer's bandwidth use or if continuous Internet access is the basis of your livelihood, you should purchase an alternate, backup connection.
While Cable One employs virus and spam checking software, the speed of new virus and spam creation is such that Cable One does not represent or warrant that traffic on its network will be virus or spam free.
In light of that, your use of the Service is at your own risk and the Service is provided without warranty or guarantee of any kind either expressed or implied, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
Without limiting the foregoing, Cable One, its parent company and affiliates will not be liable for any interruptions in service or failure to perform or partial performance that results in corrupted transmissions and will not be responsible for consequential damages of any sort.
In any event, Cable One's liability to you for all potential claims will not exceed the total amount of service fees paid during the preceding three months.
As to consumer customers, some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.
Nothing in this Agreement gives you any interest, title or license in the user ID, electronic mail address or IP address that is used in conjunction with the Service.
