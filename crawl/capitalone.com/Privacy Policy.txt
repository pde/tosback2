</p>
<p>
<em>Online Tracking &amp.
Advertising on our Sites or Apps<br>
<br>
</em>As you access our online services over time, cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons allow us to collect information such as browser type, pages visited, preferences, and your relationship with us.  Capital One may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on the websites or mobile apps we own.
In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information or the state in which you bank).  Currently, for online advertising purposes, our website does not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but these signals may be used for fraud prevention.  However, if you choose, you can set your website browser to inform you when cookies are sent or you may choose not to accept cookies.
Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of the services and offers that are available on our website.  For example, your device may not be recognized when you visit our website and, if you are an online banking customer, you may need to answer challenge questions each time you log on.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
<em>Mobile Devices<br>
<br>
</em>Some mobile devices come with a non-permanent advertising identifier or ID which gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device.  In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings.  You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile device.  By turning off ad tracking or location tracking on your mobile device, you may still see the same number of ads as before, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.<br>
<br>
<em>Behavioral Advertising on Third Party Sites<br>
<br>
</em>Certain Capital One partners may use unique cookies to collect Mobile/Online Activity Data on our website or mobile applications to advertise on third party websites Capital One products and services that may be of interest to you.  Our partners are subject to their own privacy policies.  If you prefer that our partners not display such advertisements to you, you may opt out by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices or by clicking on the AdChoices icon in an advertisement and following the instructions.  You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool or other tools provided by the publishing platform.  Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.  Additionally, we may partner with websites like Google and Yahoo to display ads to you based on search terms you use on those websites.  Please review the privacy policies of those websites for instructions on how to limit these ads.<br>
<br> Please note that you may still receive general online advertising from Capital One even after you adjust your ad preferences with certain web search engines or opt out of online advertising through AdChoices or the NAI tool.  Such advertising, however, will not be based on Online/Mobile Activity Data or search term information.<br>
<br>
<em>Email<br>
<br>
</em>If we send you an email advertisement, it will include instructions on how to opt out of receiving such emails in the future.  If you are a customer and you elect to opt out of receiving email advertisements, we may still send you emails about your account relationships with us.
To opt out of receiving email advertisements, you may submit your request at https://preferences.capitalone.com.
If your name was previously selected for any of our upcoming email offers, it is possible for you to receive information from Capital One up to 10 business days after your request has been submitted.<br>
<br> If you receive an email that claims to be from us but you are not sure, or if you think it is suspicious, do not click on any of the links in the e-mail.
Instead forward it to us at abuse@capitalone.com then delete it.  For more email security tips, see the Capital One Fraud and Identity Theft page www.capitalone.com/identity-protection/commitment  </p> Updating Your Information <p>Keeping your account information up-to-date is very important.  You may review, or update certain account information by logging into your account online.  If you cannot change the incorrect information online, or you prefer to request changes offline, please use the Contact Us option on our site, or call or write to us using the contact information listed on your account statements, records, or other account materials.</p> Protecting Children's Online Privacy <p>Capital One encourages protection of children’s information on the internet.  We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13 on our website without first obtaining consent from their parents or legal guardians.  For more information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) please refer to the FTC’s website at http://www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy.<br>
