Protect Yourself: Watch Out for Online Fraud
Don't get reeled in.
<p>In a technique called "phishing," thieves set up fraudulent websites that look official.
They may send emails to draw you to the site.
Often, people visit the site and give Personal Information in an unsecured environment, making Social Security numbers and credit card information available to thieves.</p>
Note the secure pages.
<p>When you submit Personal Information, there are two (2) things you should look for when you come to secure or safe pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lock symbol or icon will appear on the right side of the bottom bar on the page.</li>
<li>The letters "https" will appear first in your address bar at the very top of the page.</li>
</ol>Don't respond to phony emails.
<p>ETS will never send you an email asking for credit card or bank account numbers or any other financial information.
If you receive a suspicious message that looks like it came from ETS, do not respond.</p>
<p>ETS frequently sends email promotions and invitations to students and educators.
If you follow a link in an email and are directed to a website that is not ETS's official site, do not provide your Personal Information.</p>
Report fraud immediately.
<p>Send a copy of the suspicious message and any related details to etsinfo@ets.org.</p>
What to do if you're a victim:
<p>If you suspect that you may be a victim of phishing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check with your credit card company and bank to see if anyone else has illegally used your account(s).</li>
<li>Change your passwords on all online accounts.</li>
<li>Contact the appropriate credit bureaus or agencies to report the incident.</li>
<li>Write a letter to the credit card companies, banks and any other institutions or agencies documenting what happened.
Keep a copy for yourself.</li>
<li>Keep records of everything.</li>
</ul>
