Where might Linksys transfer my personal data?

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, various locations globally, including the United States, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and countries located in the EEA.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, for purposes of the GDPR, transfers of your personal data out of the EEA (if you are a resident of the EEA) will be bound by the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (available here) pursuant to the GDPR, which the European Commission has assessed as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, to ensure that your data is protected adequately.</p>
<p>By providing your personal data to us, you fully understand that Linksys may transfer, process and store your personal data outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different, and may disclose your personal data to overseas service providers who may not fully comply with the particular laws of your country.</p>
<p>If you are located in Australia, you consent to the collection, use, storage, and processing of your personal data outside of Australia as set out in this Privacy Notice.
You consent to the collection, use, storage and processing of your personal data in other countries, without us being responsible under the <em>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</em> for such use (or for any breach).
Where such parties are located outside of Australia, you may have rights to enforce such parties' compliance with applicable data protection laws, but you might not have recourse against those parties under the Australian <i>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</i> in relation to how those parties treat your personal data.</p>
How does Linksys aim to keep my personal data secure?
<p>Linksys maintains, and takes reasonable steps to ensure that its service providers maintain, appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal data against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, and access.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure.
If you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted personal data.
If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.</p>
<p>We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your personal data.
For example, create strong passwords by using a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, change your passwords often, and make sure you use a secure browser.
When creating a password for your home network, make sure you choose a unique password that you do not use for other Internet-based services.
If you use the Linksys app associated with the Service, make sure you use the official Linksys app from an authorized market or store, such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play.
You should also be aware that names that you give your WiFi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as "friendly names") may be detectable by Linksys and by others outside your home, so you should not use personal data as part of your friendly names.</p>
<p>If we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
How long will Linksys keep my personal data?
<p>We will only retain personal data to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this Privacy Notice, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.
We may, for example, keep your personal data for a reasonable time after you have stopped using the Service to ensure that Linksys has the records it needs in the event of a dispute or regulatory investigation and to ensure that any ongoing obligations can be complied with, such as complying with requests from regulators.
Where personal data is kept, that period will be determined based on the applicable local law.</p>
