TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LOCAL CONSUMER LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE LAWS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION IF YOU ARE A CUSTOMER IN AUSTRALIA OR NEW ZEALAND, YOU AGREE THAT LINKSYS AND ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, RETAILERS AND AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM TO ANY DEVICE, ANY LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER HARM THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE SERVICE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH HARM IS CAUSED BY LINKSYS.
LINKSYS AND ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, RETAILERS AND AFFILIATES DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY OR ERROR-FREE.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CONSUMER LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" FOR YOUR USE WITHOUT WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.
ALSO, DUE TO THE CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES FOR INTRUDING UPON AND ATTACKING NETWORKS, LINKSYS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE, SYSTEM(S) OR NETWORK(S) ON WHICH (OR THROUGH WHICH) THE SERVICE IS USED WILL BE FREE OF VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR ATTACK.
THE SERVICE MAY INCLUDE OR BE BUNDLED WITH A THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT, SOFTWARE OR SERVICE OFFERINGS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LOCAL CONSUMER LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY, LINKSYS DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT, SOFTWARE OR SERVICE OFFERINGS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
ONLY THOSE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS THAT ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND, IN SUCH INSTANCES, LINKSYS’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT INTENDED TO AND DOES NOT LIMIT OR EXCLUDE ANY RIGHT YOU HAVE AGAINST THE PERSON WHO SOLD THE PRODUCT TO YOU IF THAT PERSON HAS BREACHED THEIR SALES CONTRACT WITH YOU.</p>
<p>If you are located in Australia or New Zealand, the following three paragraphs apply to you:</p>

<strong>11.
General Exclusions and Limitations of Liability</strong>
</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions and circumstances, it is possible to exclude and/or to limit Linksys’s liability to consumers.
Only in those jurisdictions where it can lawfully do so, and to the full extent allowed by the local consumer laws in your country, Linksys:</p>
<ul>
<li>limits all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, acceptability, acceptable quality, satisfactory quality, quiet enjoyment or fitness for a particular purpose to the duration of the warranty period of the Product;</li>
<li>excludes all express or implied conditions, representations and warranties, including any implied warranty of non-infringement, OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO YOU BY LINKSYS IN WRITING OR AGREED TO BY LINKSYS IN WRITING;</li>
<li>excludes all liability for the loss of, or damage to, data caused by use of the Service.
and</li>
<li>excludes any liability it may have to you for: <p>a)	loss of revenue or profit,</p>
<p>b)	loss of the ability to use any third-party products, software or services, and </p>
<p>c)	any indirect, consequential, special, incidental or punitive loss or damages</p> which arise under any law and which relate to your use of, or inability to use, the Service or any related services.
This exclusion applies even if Linksys has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any warranty or remedy provided under the relevant limited warranty fails of its essential purpose.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Either party’s liability for claims that are related to, or arise out of, this Agreement or the Service shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of the fees paid by you to Linksys for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the last event giving rise to the liability and $250.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Section shall limit the liability of Linksys in relation to death or bodily injuries.</p>

<p>i.
Were not reasonably foreseeable by both parties;</p>
<p>ii.
Were known to you but not to us.
and/or</p>
<p>iii.
Were reasonably foreseeable by both parties but could have been prevented by you such as, for example (but without limitation), losses caused by viruses, Trojans, or other malicious programs, or loss of or damage to your data or your failure to keep access to the Service secure.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION ARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT CUSTOMERS MAY USE THE SERVICE FOR DIFFERENT HOME AND BUSINESS PURPOSES.
THEREFORE, ONLY YOU CAN IMPLEMENT BACK-UP PLANS AND SAFEGUARDS APPROPRIATE TO YOUR NEEDS IN THE EVENT AN ERROR IN THE SERVICE OR UNDERLYING SOFTWARE CAUSES PROBLEMS AND RELATED DATA LOSSES.
FOR THESE BUSINESS REASONS, YOU AGREE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, WITHOUT YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS PROVISION, THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE SUBCRIPTION SERVICES WOULD BE HIGHER.</p>

WHETHER OR NOT YOU PREVAIL IN THE DISPUTE SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FOUND TO BE FRIVOLOUS BY THE ARBITRATOR AS MEASURED BY RULE 11(b) OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED FOR YOUR COSTS OF ARBITRATION, WITHIN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE ARBITRATOR.
IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT YOU DEMANDED IN YOUR ARBITRATION CLAIM, LINKSYS WILL PAY FOR YOUR REASONABLE AND ACTUAL ATTORNEYS’ FEES YOU HAVE INCURRED TO ARBITRATE THE DISPUTE, PLUS A MINIMUM RECOVERY OF $2,500.
ANY DECISION OR AWARD BY THE ARBITRATOR RENDERED IN AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON EACH PARTY, AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
IF EITHER PARTY BRINGS A DISPUTE IN A COURT OR OTHER NON-ARBITRATION FORUM, THE ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE MAY AWARD THE OTHER PARTY ITS REASONABLE COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ATTORNEYS’ FEES) INCURRED IN ENFORCING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING STAYING OR DISMISSING SUCH DISPUTE.</p>
<p>NEITHER YOU NOR LINKSYS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION YOU MAY HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO ARBITRATE A DISPUTE ON A CLASSWIDE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS, AND THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THOSE RIGHTS AND AGREE INSTEAD TO ARBITRATE ONLY YOUR OWN DISPUTE(S) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, YOU AND LINKSYS EACH ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EITHER PARTY MAY, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ARBITRATION, BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE, SO LONG AS SUCH SMALL CLAIMS COURT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR OR ALLOW FOR JOINDER OR CONSOLIDATION OF CLAIMS.</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION (OTHER THAN THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) TO THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES.
HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED, IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER AND YOU LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE LINKSYS MARKETS OR PROMOTES THE SERVICE, LOCAL LAW MAY REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE APPLY TO SOME SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS AND THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LIMITATION PERIOD IN THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS IS HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED AND WILL NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>EXCEPT FOR INDIVIDUAL SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT IN ANY SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE JURISDICTION AND VENUE ARE PROPER, ANY ARBITRATION, LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE COMMENCED IN (1) NEW YORK, NEW YORK, (2) ATLANTA, GEORGIA, (3) CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, (4) DALLAS, TEXAS, (5) SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, OR (6) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, AND YOU AND LINKSYS EACH IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING.
HOWEVER, FOR A DISPUTE OF $2,500 OR LESS, YOU MAY CHOOSE WHETHER THE ARBITRATION IN ANY OF THE SIX REGIONAL VENUES PROCEEDS IN PERSON, BY TELEPHONE, OR BASED ONLY ON SUBMISSIONS.</p>
<p>How to Opt-Out of Mandatory Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Linksys may file a lawsuit in court rather than resolving the Dispute by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies for small claims court (there are monetary limitations for small claims court), or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
In order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, You must (i) mail written notification to Belkin International, Inc., 12045 E.
Waterfront Drive, Playa Vista, California, 90094, Attn: Chief Legal Officer, or (ii) email written notification to arbitrationoptout@belkin.com.
In either case, such written notification must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Linksys through arbitration.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or, if the dispute qualifies, in small claims court.</p>
<p>If you are located outside of the United States, the following clause applies to you:</p>
<p>This Agreement will be governed by California law, without reference to conflict of laws principles.
The state and federal courts of California shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement.
However, if you are a consumer and you live in a country where Linksys markets or promotes the Service, local consumer law may require that certain consumer protection laws of your country of residence apply to some sections of this Agreement.
Each of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded and will not apply to this Agreement.</p>
