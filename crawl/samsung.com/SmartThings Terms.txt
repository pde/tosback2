Will these Terms ever change?
<p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.
We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the Services and/or by sending you an email.</p>
<p>If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them.
unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.
If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
<p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

</ol>Does SmartThings cost anything?
<p>SmartThings reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain features of the Services.
Should you elect to subscribe to such features, you shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Services in connection with such features.
Subject to any subscription agreement or other restrictions, SmartThings reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon ten (10) days prior notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Services.
Use of the Services by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p>
Will SmartThings ever change the Services?
<p>We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.
We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.
In some cases, the changes we make to the Services may cause older hardware devices, third party services, software configurations or setups to no longer work with the Services, and you may be required to upgrade or change these devices, services, configurations or setups in order to continue using the Services.
We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical.
Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content (including any SmartApps or device or external service connections provided by SmartThings or by third parties) from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
What are the restrictions to Content in the Services?
<p>The materials displayed or performed on the Services, including, but not limited to, applications, software and/or services that are designed to operate with the Services ("SmartApps"), text, graphics, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the "Content") are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.
You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including SmartThings's) rights.</p>
<p>You understand that SmartThings owns the Services.
You won't modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
<p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content.
please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn't mean that all the restrictions above don't apply.</p>
What about information and data that I provide to the Service or that the Service collects?
<p>You may post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide Content, information, or data to or through the Services in various ways.
Any Content, information, materials or data that you provide to us in any way through the Services is referred to as your "User Submission." In addition, when you connect various hardware devices (such as sensors), third party services, or applications (such as SmartApps) with the Services, those hardware devices and applications will in most cases provide information or data to the Services, often in an automated fashion, and we refer to this information and data as "Device Data".
You own your User Submissions and Device Data, and SmartThings does not claim any ownership over your User Submissions or Device Data.
You grant us certain rights in your User Submissions and Device, as further detailed below.
Please note that the following license is subject to our Privacy Policy (to the extent they relate to User Submissions or Device Data that are also your personally-identifiable information).
You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all rights to such User Submissions and Device Data and that disclosure and use of such User Submissions and Device Data by SmartThings (including without limitation, publishing content on the Services) will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party.</p>
<p>Subject to our Privacy Policy (where applicable), for all User Submissions and Device Data, you hereby do and shall grant SmartThings a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, share, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions and Device Data in connection with the Services, and SmartThings's (and its successors' and assigns') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and services).</p>
<p>Unless explicitly acknowledged or committed to as part of a feature of the Services, SmartThings has no obligation to maintain or persist your User Submissions or Device Data for any specified period of time, to guarantee access to User Submissions or Device Data, and has no liability for User Submissions or Device Data submitted to the Services that are or become unavailable through the Services.
You hereby grant SmartThings a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback that you provide to SmartThings relating to the operation of the Services.</p>
<p>SmartThings does not endorse and has no control over any User Submission.
You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Service and all User Submissions provided by you are at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom.
Please note that if you have registered with us as a SmartThings developer pursuant to our Platform Developer Agreement, the Platform Development Agreement will govern our use of any code that you submit to us under that agreement.</p>
What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), as it relates to online service providers, like SmartThings, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone's copyright.
We respect others' intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
<p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.
We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
We can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.
You will keep all your registration information accurate and current.
You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party SmartApps, websites or services that are not owned or controlled by SmartThings.
When you access third party SmartApps or websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that SmartThings is not responsible for such risks.
We encourage you to be aware when you use any third party SmartApps or services or when you leave the Services, and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party SmartApp, website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>
<p>SmartThings has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.
In particular, when you use a SmartApp provided by a third party or connect a third party service to the Services, that third party may place additional terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) on your use of that SmartApp or any associated services, and you agree that you will comply with all such terms and conditions.
We are not responsible for (and do not endorse) any third party terms and conditions, or any third party SmartApps or services.
In addition, SmartThings will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party SmartApp, site or service.
By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party SmartApp, website or service.</p>
<p>Your interactions with third party organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services under any transaction you enter into with a third party, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.
You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
You agree that SmartThings shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between participants in relation to the Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that SmartThings is under no obligation to become involved.
In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release SmartThings, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.
If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
What if I want to stop using the Services?
<p>You're free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@smartthings.com.
please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have requested deletion of your Services account.
SmartThings is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.
SmartThings has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any User Submissions and/or Device Data associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.
We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions or Device Data you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law, these Terms, and the functionality of the Services), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of SmartThings.</p>
<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@smartthings.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can't promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>
<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.
By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
