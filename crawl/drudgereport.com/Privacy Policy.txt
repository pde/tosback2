<p>Intermarkets, Inc.
is an online advertising management services firm that offers advertisers opportunities to display their interactive ads on websites that are included within the Intermarkets Portfolio (“Website” or “Websites”).
Our services streamline the selection and delivery of interactive ads for advertisers and website publishers.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.
This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Intermarkets or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share information when you are served an advertisement on the Website.
This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences.</p>
<p>By using the Website, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Intermarkets does not own, control, manage, or employ.</p>
<p>Intermarkets uses the following ad servers and their privacy policies can be found by clicking on their names below:</p>
<p>AppNexus
DFP
LiveIntent
OpenX</p>
<p>We are committed to following the National Advertising Initiative’s Self-Regulatory Principles.</p> Information We Collect through the Site
<p>
<strong>Personally Identifiable Information:
</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, username, email address, credit card details, and other information as we may from time to time request at our discretion (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”) if you choose to share such information with us.
For example, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information when you register with or use our services, when you register with or use the Site, and at other times.
The decision to provide this information is optional.
however, if you elect not to register with or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the Site.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Intermarkets service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, special promotions, and Intermarkets newsletters, which are considered part of your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>
</p>
<p>We automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you use the Site.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes demographic information (such as age, gender, city or state) and a user’s click stream information.
Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, Web pages viewed, the date and time at which those pages were viewed and interaction with content and advertisements on those Web pages.
Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.
Intermarkets collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information and stores it in log files.
We use this information to help us understand how people use our Site.
For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your ISP, which pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site.</p>
<p>We may supplement our click stream data with Non Personally Identifiable Information (namely, behavioral and demographic data from third party Services Providers as defined below) to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of our Site and those of our Portfolio publishers.
This anonymous supplemental data may include such things as zip code, age, gender, and income range.
We use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see.
This information also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes.
We also aggregate anonymous cookie data in order to identify large audience segments that assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience.</p>
<p>While we encourage third party advertising providers to comply with applicable law and self-regulatory standards, there are far too many online advertising transactions occurring on our publishers’ websites to police every transaction.
We pass through all advertising disclosures and opt-out mechanisms of the advertising providers, but the use and collection of information by our third-party advertising Service Providers is governed by the individual privacy policies of those providers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser), Web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage), and other similar technologies to improve the quality of the Site and to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant advertising.
Our cookie does not include your name or anything personal to you.
It simply tells us that we have encountered your computer at some prior point.
Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
You can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies.
Alternatively, you are always free to opt out of the cookies.</p>
<p>Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.
If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here.</p> How We Use and Share Information Collected through the Site

For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development.
We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services, however, each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>
