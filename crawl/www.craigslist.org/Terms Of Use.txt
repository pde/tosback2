GENERAL craigslist, Inc.
("CL") provides services through its websites, programs and computer servers, including but not limited to classified advertising, forums, and email forwarding.
(All such services are referred to collectively herein as "craigslist.
") By accessing or using craigslist, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to the terms below (the "Terms of Use" or "TOU") as a legal contract between you and CL.
The TOU include and incorporate additional terms ("guidelines") applicable to particular categories or services available on craigslist as set forth to users upon access to such categories or services.
CL may post changes to the TOU at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of craigslist.
If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the TOU, now or in the future, you may reject the TOU by immediately terminating all access and use of craigslist, in which case any continuing access or use of craigslist is unauthorized.
You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on craigslist.
craigslist is intended and designed for users 18 years of age and older, and access or use by anyone younger is not authorized.
The TOU grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access craigslist and use craigslist, in whole or in part, including but not limited to CL intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with the TOU.
"CRAIGSLIST" and "CL" are trademarks of CL and are protected by United States and international laws.
The TOU do not authorize you to use "CRAIGSLIST," "CL" or any similar or related marks (including, for example and without limitation, "Craigs," "Craig," "Craig's" and "_______list") for any use pertaining to classified advertising, Internet advertising, social networks, online forums, online communication services or any similar or related use, or any other use that is likely to cause confusion on the part of, to cause mistake by or to deceive the public as to any affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, approval or endorsement by or with CL.
2.
MODERATION CL has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via craigslist by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of craigslist) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that CL, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access).
CL may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time.
CL action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive CL's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.
You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by CL or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "CL Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither CL nor any CL Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOU.
Although CL Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOU compliance on craigslist at CL's discretion, CL Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of CL will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of CL will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring.
Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any CL Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of CL or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of CL) that CL (including but not limited to any CL Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of CL, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of CL) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable.
Specifically, you agree that CL, CL Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of CL shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that CL, a CL Representative or anyone else on behalf of CL would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation.
This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by CL's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
CL also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of craigslist at any time without notice.
CL and CL Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto.

POSTING AND ACCOUNTS This section 4 applies to all uses and users of craigslist, unless CL has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement.
CL has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 4.
a.
Postings craigslist is intended and designed as a local service.
A user may post content only to the single specific geographic area offered on craigslist (see http://www.
craigslist.
org/about/sites) for which that content is most relevant.
The same or substantially similar content (for example, an ad for a particular item or service, a particular offer, a particular message or a particular comment) may not be posted to or communicated via more than one such geographic area.
Content that is equally relevant to multiple (i.
e.
, more than one) geographic areas should not be posted on craigslist.
The same or substantially similar content may not be posted in more than one craigslist category.
A user may post content only in the single craigslist category to which it is most relevant, and must not post content to inappropriate categories.
For example, content advertising classes or vocational training must be posted under the "classes" category of the "community" section and may not be posted in any "jobs" category.
Likewise, content advertising auto financing must be posted under the "financial" category of the "services" sections and not under "cars/trucks" category in the "for sale" section.
Similarly, services relating to real estate must be posted under "real estate" category of the "services" section and may not be posted to any category within the "housing" section.
A user may post the same or substantially similar content no more than once every 48 hours.
Where a craigslist category provides specific subcategories for posts by particular types of users (e.
g.
, car sales "by-owners" versus "by-dealers," and real estate for sale "by-owner" versus "by-broker"), a user may post content only in the single user sub-category most accurate for that user.
In particular, no user acting as a broker, agent or dealer may post in any "by owner" category.
Users may not circumvent any technological measure implemented by CL to restrict the manner in which content may be posted on craigslist or to regulate the manner in which content (including but not limited to email) may be transmitted to other users.
This prohibition includes, without limitation, a ban on the use of multiple email addresses (created via an email address generator or otherwise); the use of multiple IP addresses (via proxy servers, modem toggling, or otherwise); CAPTCHA circumvention, automation or outsourcing; multiple and/or fraudulent craigslist accounts, including phone-verified accounts; URL shortening, obfuscation or redirection; use of multiple phone lines or phone forwarding for verification; and content obfuscation via HTML techniques, printing text on images, inserting random text or content "spinning.
" It is expressly prohibited for any third party to post content to craigslist on behalf of another.
Users must post content only on their own behalf, and may not permit, enable, induce or encourage any third party to post content for them.
It is expressly prohibited to post content to craigslist using any automated means.
Users must post all content personally and manually through all steps of the posting process.
It is also expressly prohibited for any user to develop, offer, market, sell, distribute or provide an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part).
Any user who develops, offers, markets, sells, distributes or provides an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part) shall be responsible and liable to CL for each instance of access to craigslist (by any user or other third party) using that automated means.
Affiliate marketing is expressly prohibited on craigslist.
Users may not post content or communicate with any craigslist user for purposes of affiliate marketing or in connection with any affiliate marketing system, scheme or program in any manner or under any circumstance.
b.
Accounts A user may maintain and use no more than one account, including a telephone or phone-verified account ("PVA"), to post content.
A user specifically may not create or use additional accounts for the purpose of circumventing technological restrictions (security measures) in the posting process or otherwise for posting content in violation of the TOU.
A user may create an account, including a PVA, only on his/her own behalf.
A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to create accounts or PVAs for him/her.
The creation of accounts or PVAs for others is expressly prohibited.
A user must only use his/her own account or PVA, and may not use any account or PVA of another.
The purchase and sale of accounts, including but not limited to PVAs, is expressly prohibited.
A user must create his/her account or PVA personally and manually and may not create accounts or PVAs by any automated means.
Without limitation, this includes the obligation that the user personally and manually solves any CAPTCHA challenge in the account creation process.
Further, a user must create any PVA using his/her own valid telephone number.
The creation of a PVA using a telephone number that is not the user's own, a telephonic forwarding service or system, or a temporary/disposable telephone number or service is expressly prohibited.
The circumvention of any technological restriction or security measure in the account creation or PVA creation process is also expressly prohibited.
c.
Flagging A user shall not "flag" (or otherwise seek removal of) content on craigslist without a personal, good-faith belief that the content violates the TOU.
A user may flag content only on his/her own behalf.
A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to flag content for them.

Any access to or use of craigslist to design, develop, test, update, operate, modify, maintain, support, market, advertise, distribute or otherwise make available any program, application or service (including, without limitation, any device, technology, product, computer program, mobile device application, website, or mechanical or personal service) that enables or provides access to, use of, operation of or interoperation with craigslist (including, without limitation, to access content, post content, cross-post content, re-post content, respond or reply to content, verify content, transmit content, create accounts, verify accounts, use accounts, circumvent and/or automate technological security measures or restrictions, or flag content) is prohibited.
