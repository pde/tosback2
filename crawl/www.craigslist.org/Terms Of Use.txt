You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not.

Unless noted, fees are in US dollars.

To the extent permitted by law, fees are nonrefundable, even for posts we remove.
We may refuse purchases, which may place a hold on your account.</p>
<p>

WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to CL, its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability.

(6) IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.</p>
<p>

legal fees) arising from claims related to your CL use.

marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g.
through an affiliate network).
and (8) to pay us for breaching or inducing others to breach the "USE" section, not as a penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post, email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected, and $1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.</p>
<p>
<b>MISC.</b> Users complying with prior written licenses may access CL thereby until authorization is terminated.
Otherwise, this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us.
If a TOU term is unenforceable, other terms are unaffected.
If TOU translations conflict with the English version, English controls.
