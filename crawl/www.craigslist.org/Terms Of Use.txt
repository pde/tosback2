By accessing or otherwise interacting with our servers, services, websites, or any associated content/postings (together, "CL"), you agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU") (last updated December 29, 2017).
You acknowledge and agree CL is a private site owned and operated by craigslist, Inc.
If you are accessing or using CL on behalf of a business, that business agrees to the TOU.
If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not authorized to use CL.
We may modify the TOU at any time in our sole discretion.
You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and are bound by them if you continue to use CL.
Our privacy policy (cl.com/about/privacy.policy), prohibited list (cl.com/about/prohibited), and all other policies, site rules, and agreements referenced below or on CL, are fully incorporated into this TOU, and you agree to them as well.</p>
<p>
<b>LICENSE.</b> If you agree to the TOU and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use CL and be bound by the TOU, or (2) use CL on behalf of a business, thereby binding that business to the TOU, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use CL in compliance with the TOU.
unlicensed use is unauthorized.
You agree not to display, "frame," make derivative works, distribute, license, or sell, content from CL, excluding postings you create.
You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.</p>
<p>
<b>USE.</b> Unless licensed by us in a written agreement, you agree not to use or provide software (except general purpose web browsers and email clients) or services that interact or interoperate with CL, e.g.
for downloading, uploading, creating/accessing/using an account, posting, flagging, emailing, searching, or mobile use.
You agree not to copy/collect CL content via robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand).

You agree not to post content that is prohibited by any of CL's policies or rules referenced above ("Prohibited Content").
You agree not to abuse CL's flagging or reporting processes.
You agree not to collect CL user information or interfere with CL.
You agree we may moderate CL access/use in our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking, filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding, omitting, verifying, or terminating your access/license/account.
You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not.</p>
<p>
<b>LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.</b> You further agree that if you violate the USE section, or you encourage, support, benefit from, or induce others to do so, you will be jointly and severally liable to us for liquidated damages as follows for: (A) collecting/harvesting CL users' information, including personal or identifying information - $1 per violation.
(B) publishing/misusing personal or identifying information of a third party in connection with your use of CL without that party's express written consent - $1,000 per violation.
(C) misrepresenting your identity or affiliation to anyone in connection with your use of CL - $1,000 per violation.
(D) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content - $4 per violation.
(E) posting or attempting to post Prohibited Content in any paid section of CL - the price per post applicable to that section of CL.
(F) sending an unauthorized/unsolicited email to an email address obtained from CL - $25 per violation.

(M) bypassing or attempting to bypass our moderation efforts - $4 per violation.
You agree that these amounts are (1) a reasonable estimate of our damages (as actual damages are often difficult to calculate), (2) not a penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting on our ability to recover under any legal theory or claim, including statutory damages and other equitable relief (e.g., for spam, we can elect between the above liquidated damages or statutory damages under the anti-spam statute).
You further agree that repeated violations of the USE section will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages.</p>
