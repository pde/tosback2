We may also collect contact information about your friends and family members when you participate in one of our refer-a-friend programs.
In these instances, we may send a message to your friend or family member on your behalf.

 Information We Observe or Collect through Technology <ol>
<li> a.
 Navigational Information <p>When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, <abbr>IP</abbr> address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate.
Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you.
However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.</p>
</li>
<li> b.
 Cookies and Clear gifs <p>To better understand what you do while on this Web site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie.
A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer.
It's used to do things like see how you navigate this Web site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return.
This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.</p>
<p>We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on this Web site and in our emails.
A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message.
It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time this Web site or email in question is viewed.
Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.
and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.
These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most–for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites.
and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to this Web site.
Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address).
We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you.
to improve our business.
to transact business.
and to market our products and services on this and other Web sites and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail.
As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart.
We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences.
The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</p>
<p>For information about your options with respect to cookies, see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.</p>

To serve this advertising, these third-party companies place, use, or rely on technology, such as cookies and clear gifs, to obtain information about customer interactions with us through our Web sites and interactions with other Web sites.

And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices.
It is possible that the third party providing content through our Web site may collect or observe information through its use of technology.

</li>
<li> 3.
