<p>To Our Victoria’s Secret Family,</p>
<br>
<p>With constant breaking news regarding COVID-19, we have made the decision to temporarily close our online store through March 29.
As with our previous announcement regarding store closures, we will be paying associates who are impacted by these actions.</p>
<br>
<p>We ask for your understanding during this time relative to orders you may have placed that have not yet been fulfilled.
Our customer care team will be sending out update emails in the next few days regarding order status.
</p>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, they are available to respond to any questions, concerns or feedback you may have and can be reached at customercare.victoriassecret.com</p>
<br>
<p>The safety of our customers and employees remains our number one priority.
If you have any questions, concerns or feelings you’d like to share with us, we’re available on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<br>
<p>As we continue to reassess the situation, we’ll inform you of updates as soon as possible.</p>
<br>
<p>Our thoughts remain with you and your families during this unprecedented time.
Stay well and we look forward to opening our doors and our site again soon.</p>
<br>
<p>Victoria’s Secret</p>
