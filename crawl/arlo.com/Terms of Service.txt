DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIUDAL BASIS AND ARE THEREFORE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong>To the extent possible under your local law, both you and the Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims out of or relating to this Agreement, any Arlo Services, or your relationship to Arlo.
All disputes concerning whether a claim is subject to arbitration (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve claims.
Arbitration is less formal than a traditional court proceeding and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and consumer contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.
To the extent JAMS is not available in your state, the arbitration will be governed and administered by the American Arbitration Association Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The right to arbitration under this Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will also be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§§ 1 et seq.).
Both parties agree that the parties’ relationship involves interstate commerce.
Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p>
<strong>EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
For all purposes of this Agreement, for any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>
<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
The parties agree that they both give up the right to a jury trial, and that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit: CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER ARE OPTIONAL.</strong> You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to legal@arlo.com within thirty (30) calendar days of agreeing to these Terms.</p>
