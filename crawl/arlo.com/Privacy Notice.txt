<p>We may use personal information to let you know about our products and services that we believe will be of interest to you.
We use the personal information that we may have such as first name, surname, home address, purchase history, telephone number, email address and country of residence.
We may contact you by email, post, or telephone or through other communication channels (such as targeted online advertising).

6 1 (f) (legitimate business interest) and in some cases, Art.
6 1 (a) (your consent).</p>
<p>
<strong>How you can manage your marketing preferences</strong>

<p>
<strong>When and how we undertake profiling and analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>We use your data as part of data analysis and market research.

<br>
</li>

<p>
<strong>Security of your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>We have implemented and continuously improve our technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.</p>
<p>As the security of your personal information depends in part on the effectiveness of the security of the devices (computer/ laptop/ mobile/ tablet/ etc) you use to communicate with us and the security measures you use to protect your access (User IDs and passwords), we encourage you to take necessary measures to protect this information.</p>
<p>Arlo wire-free cameras connect to the Arlo base station camera network using WiFI Protected Setup (WPS) and WPA2-AES data encryption.
The WiFI connection is protected by a random, unique, long password that is not physically visible on the product.
This password is programmed at the factory in the base station and re-generated upon factory-reset.</p>
<p>The Arlo base station connects to the backend through the customers home router using an Ethernet cable.
Protective measures ensure that the base station is not accessible on the LAN.</p>
<p>The data is collected in a secure fashion, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used during the transportation of data.
Accounts are authenticated using a secure login mechanism.
We use one-way hashing in combination with salt for all passwords.
Finally, we do not access or share any data unless required to by law or with your permission to help resolve system problems.</p>
<p>Payments: All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secure communication methods and then securely stored into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems.
The payment gateway provider must keep the information confidential.
Arlo Europe does not store payment information, instead such information is kept with our payment providers who are PCI compliant.</p>
