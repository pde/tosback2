 Privacy Policy <p>At the British Library, <em>we</em> care about the privacy of the people who use <em>our Services,</em> and this <em>Policy</em> explains how <em>we</em> deal with <em>your personal information</em> in relation to <em>our Services.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>We</em> explain many of the terms used in this <em>Policy</em> on <em>our</em> Definitions page – defined terms are shown in italics.</p>
<p>Depending upon <em>your</em> relationship with <em>us, we</em> may also provide you with additional <em>Service</em> specific information about <em>our</em> use of your <em>personal information</em> which should be read alongside this <em>Policy.</em> Specific details relating to <em>our Services</em> can be found on the Our Services page.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>1.            What type of information does the British Library collect about you?</strong>
<p>1.1          <em>We</em> may collect certain <em>personal information</em> which (either on its own or when combined with other information <em>we</em> hold about <em>you</em>) allows <em>us</em> to identify <em>you</em> as an individual and which is about <em>you</em>.
<em>You</em> can see details of the types of <em>personal information</em>
<em>we</em> may collect on the Personal Information page.</p>
<p>1.2          <em>We</em> will normally collect <em>personal information</em> directly from <em>you</em> when <em>you</em> volunteer it to <em>us</em> or from <em>your</em> use of <em>our Services</em>.
Normally, <em>we</em> try to limit <em>our</em> use of information which allows <em>us</em> to identify you as a named individual to the details <em>we</em> need to provide the requested or agreed <em>Service</em> for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>1.3          Where possible, <em>we</em> collect and use details which do not identify you as a named individual, such as website usage information, aggregated information and statistics and other details of how <em>you</em> use <em>our</em> online content and <em>Services</em>.
Some of this information may involve the use of cookies and web beacons.
Please see the <strong>Depersonalised &amp.
Anonymous Information</strong> section below, as well as our Cookie Policy for more information.</p>
<p>1.4          However, <em>we</em> may also collect information from and/or combine <em>your personal information</em> with information from other sources.
<em>We</em> only do this where lawful to do so and where it helps the Library to provide efficient, relevant Services to <em>our</em> users.
<em>You</em> can find more details about other such sources on the Data Collection page.</p>
<p>1.5          <em>We</em> do not normally collect any <em>sensitive personal information</em> from or about <em>you</em> and do not wish to do so unless essential.
<em>You</em> can find more details about such situations on the Personal Information page.</p>
<p>1.6          <em>We</em> may store <em>your personal information</em> in electronic and/or hard copy format.</p>
<p>1.7          To understand why <em>we</em> collect and further use <em>your personal information</em> please see the <strong>Why does the British Library use your personal information</strong> section below.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>2.            How does the British Library collect your personal information?</strong>
<p>2.1          The <em>Policy</em> applies to any <em>personal information</em>
<em>we</em> collect through <em>our data collection media.</em> See the Data Collection page for more details.</p>
<p>2.2          <em>We</em> collect <em>your personal information</em> through <em>our data collection media</em> whenever <em>you</em> use any of <em>our Services</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>3.            Why does the British Library use your personal information?</strong>
<p>3.1          The <em>Library</em> may use <em>your personal information</em> for a variety of purposes, depending upon the <em>Service</em> you have requested or are using.
This will normally simply be to do what <em>you</em> have requested, such as to deal with <em>your</em> enquiry, give <em>you</em> access to the <em>Library</em>, provide a requested book to <em>you</em>, or send <em>you</em> tickets to an event.</p>
<p>3.2          Other uses of <em>personal information</em> will be to ensure that the <em>Library</em> can meet its legal, regulatory and good governance obligations (and regulator’s expectations), such as meeting audit requirements.</p>
<p>3.3          In addition, where agreed with <em>you</em>, <em>we</em> may tailor <em>our</em> communications and dealings with you to better reflect <em>your</em> needs and preferences, such as sending you newsletters with <em>your</em> preferred topics highlighted, or to inform <em>you</em> that <em>our</em> shop offers a book relevant to an event you are attending, or to make you aware that an event similar to one recently attended by you is being scheduled.</p>
<p>3.4          More details about why <em>we</em> use <em>your personal information</em> can be found on the Purposes page.</p>
<p>3.5          The Purposes page is not intended to be exhaustive and may be updated from time to time in line with the <em>Library</em>’s business needs and legal requirements.</p>
<p>3.6          <em>We</em> may also convert <em>personal information</em> into depersonalised (“pseudonymous”) data or anonymous data and use it (normally on an aggregated statistical basis) for research and analysis to improve <em>our</em> Services, processes and performance.
For more information, please see the <strong>Depersonalised and Anonymous Information</strong> section directly below.</p>
<p>3.7          In carrying out the above, the <em>Library</em> processes <em>your</em> personal data in a variety of ways, each of which may have a different legal basis.
<em>We</em> may process <em>your</em> personal data because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>You</em> have given your consent (e.g.
for the provision of marketing correspondence)</li>
<li>It is necessary for the performance of a contract with <em>you</em> (e.g.
the purchase of tickets or other goods or services)</li>
<li>
<em>We</em> are under a legal obligation to do so (e.g.
for equality monitoring or health &amp.
safety purposes)</li>
<li>It is in the public interest and in the performance of <em>our</em> official duties (e.g.
the provision of access to, and the security of, <em>our</em> Collections as set out in the British Library Act 1972)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<strong>4.            Depersonalised and Anonymous Information</strong>
<p>4.1          Depersonalised or aggregated information does not personally identify <em>you</em>.
It may be used for statistical analysis and administration, including analysis of trends, carrying out actuarial work, tailoring products and <em>Services</em>, risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to <em>our Services</em>.</p>
<p>4.2          <em>We</em> may automatically collect certain information from you (such as usage information) when <em>you</em> use <em>our data collection media,</em> through the use of web beacons, device identifiers, pixel tags, cookies and similar technologies.
<em>We</em> may combine this information with other <em>personal information</em> that <em>we</em> have collected from or about <em>you</em> in order to learn more about how <em>you</em> use <em>our data collection media</em> and <em>Services</em> so that <em>we</em> can improve <em>our Service</em> offering.</p>
<p>4.3          To find out more about how <em>we</em> collect and use this automatically collected information, please see <em>our</em> Cookies Policy.</p>

<strong>5.            Does the British Library share <em>personal information</em> with third parties?</strong>
<p>5.1          Your <em>personal information</em> will be made available to those members of <em>our</em> staff who need to see it in order to perform their functions/roles/responsibilities at the <em>Library</em> in respect of the <em>Services you</em> have requested or agreed to use.</p>
<p>5.2          <em>Your personal information</em> may be held by <em>us</em> in one or more customer relationship management or CRM database(s), consolidating details of <em>your</em> dealings with the <em>Library</em> across various Services, to ensure <em>we</em> have clear and accurate records about <em>your</em> use of <em>our</em> Services, to better understand <em>your</em> requirements and how <em>we</em> might provide other <em>Services</em> to <em>you</em>.   For instance, the <em>Library</em> may assess <em>your</em> attendance at events, against <em>your</em> purchases from <em>our</em> shop, in order to consider making you aware that event specific products may be purchased from our shop.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> Details relating to the specific Collection Items that you have requested during <em>your</em> use of <em>our</em> Collections (for example through use of <em>our</em> Reading Rooms or <em>our</em> remote <em>Services</em> such as Document Supply) will never be used to provide marketing analysis or similar functions.</p>
<p>5.3          In addition, the <em>Library</em> makes use of expert third party service providers to help it to provide relevant <em>Services,</em> such as expert IT providers helping the Library with <em>our</em> IT systems, or professional auditors<em>.</em> These third party service providers may use <em>your personal information</em> in order to provide the agreed <em>Service</em> to the <em>Library,</em> or to <em>you</em> on <em>our</em> behalf.
Please note that certain individuals who will see <em>your personal information</em> may not be based at the <em>Library</em> or in <em>your</em> country (please see <strong>below</strong>).</p>
<p>5.4          <em>We</em> may share <em>personal information</em> within the Library’s advisory boards, panels and councils as needed for reasonable management, analysis, planning and decision making, including in relation to taking decisions regarding <em>our Service</em> offering, order or customer request fulfillment.</p>
<p>5.5          Where thought necessary by the Library, in limited cases, your <em>personal information</em> may also be shared with other people and organisations outside the <em>Library</em> to the extent permitted or required by law (for example, to meet legal obligations on the Library, or to provide reasonable voluntary cooperation with a relevant police investigation), as further described on the Sharing Your Personal Information page.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>6.
           Will the British Library send your personal information overseas?</strong>
<p>6.1             You should be aware that the recipients of <em>your personal information</em> (as set out in this <em>policy</em>) may be located in countries or territories outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) which may not have data protection laws equivalent to those in the UK.</p>
<p>6.2             Where <em>we</em> (or our third party service providers acting on <em>our</em> behalf) transfer <em>your</em>
<em>personal information</em> to countries outside of the EEA, <em>we</em> will put in place such other measures as are required by law to ensure that those transfers are adequately protected.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>7.               What are your choices relating to contact from us?</strong>

<em>We</em> may contact <em>you</em> by email (or in some cases by mail) to tell <em>you</em> this information, but <em>we</em> will obtain <em>your</em> consent before contacting <em>you</em> with “direct marketing<em>”</em> in this way.</p>
<p>7.3          <em>We</em> will ensure that any direct marketing communications that <em>you</em> receive from the <em>Library</em> provide a simple way for <em>you</em> to decline or change your mind about further marketing.
For example, in emails the <em>Library</em> may provide <em>you</em> with an ‘unsubscribe’ link, or an email address to which <em>you</em> can send an opt-out request.
The <em>Library</em> will take steps to stop any direct marketing to which <em>you</em> object, or in respect of which <em>you</em> withdraw <em>your</em> consent, within a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for the change to be administered after being told of <em>your</em> objection or withdrawal of consent.</p>
<p>7.4             If <em>you</em> tell <em>us</em> that <em>you</em> no longer wish to receive the <em>Library’s</em> direct marketing communications <em>we</em> will take steps to respect <em>your</em> modified direct marketing preferences and will keep a record of <em>your</em> request so as to avoid contacting <em>you</em> again in the future with direct marketing content.</p>
