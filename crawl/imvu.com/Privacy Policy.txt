<li>Compile statistics and analytics about your use of and interaction with the Services, including details about how and where our Services are accessed, how often you visit or use the Services, the date and time of your visits, your actions on the Services, and information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data.

<p>
The information you enter on the Services or otherwise provide to IMVU may be transferred outside of your country to the United States of America and other jurisdictions which does not offer an equivalent level of protection as in other parts of the world (i.e., as in the European Union).
In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation.
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations.
By agreeing to the terms of use and this Privacy Notice, you agree to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, particularly the European Union, and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Notice.

With regard to Creators, we retain financial information, Tax IDs and related information for as long as required by law.
</p>
<p>
Meta data on the Services which is needed for the purposes of IT security and maintaining the Services in general, can be retained for the prevention of abuse of minors, and therefore will be retained for such purpose for a period of up to three years.

</p>
<p>
Any data collected with valid user consent will be retained until it is withdrawn or if we are not able to refresh it.
</p>
<p>
<u>Exceptions</u>
</p>
<p>
There are exceptions from static retention periods that have to be taken into consideration.
For instance, we cannot delete personal data when there are legal obligations to retain the data (e.g.
arising from tax or commercial law).
This is particularly true of data regarding financial transactions (e.g.
in-service/app purchases.
funds for Creators) and payment information.
</p>
<p>

When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.
</p> Purpose of the Processing and Legal Bases <p>
IMVU uses your personal information for a number of different purposes.
Some are essential for us to provide the Services you use or to fulfill our legal obligations, some help us run the Services efficiently and effectively and some enable us to provide you with more relevant and personalized offers and information.
We use your personal information to provide our Services, for example to set up and run your account, process orders and transactions, respond to queries and comments, and provide you with the best possible level of customer service
</p>
<p>
In all cases we must have a reason and a legal ground for processing your personal information.
Some of the most common legal grounds we rely on are briefly explained below.
</p>
<p>
<u>Legitimate Interests.</u>
</p>
<p>We may process personal data for our own legitimate business interests.
This relates to our ability to provide and maintain Services that work well and to give you the best Services, while making sure that you have the most secure experience.
When we rely on this legal basis, we'll carry out a legitimate interest assessment to ensure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws.
Our legitimate business interests don't automatically override your interests - we won't use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.
</p>
<p>
If you establish a user profile, we will process your data in order to provide you a profile page on the Services, and enable you to have the best user experience.
We may also process your information to allow you to move from one device to another, without it impacting your status, or to purchase virtual items on the Services.
We may also process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our Services, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure.
We also have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that's tailored to your interests.
</p>
<p>
If you have any concerns about the processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests.
For more information on your rights, please see <b>"Staying in Control of Your Information: Your Rights"</b> below.
</p>
<p>
<u>Contractual.</u>
</p>
<p>We may process your personal data for the purposes of a contract to which you are a party, in other words your ability to use the Services.
For instance, if you establish a user profile, we will process your data in order to provide you a profile page.
Likewise, if you purchase virtual items on the Services, we will process your data in order to carry out the payment transaction.
</p>
<p>
You have the right to request that IMVU amend your data, and you can ask for your data to be removed if you decide that you no longer want to use the Services.
If we don't have any legal requirements to keep this, then we will remove it.
</p>
<p>
<u>Consent.</u>
</p>
<p>IMVU may use consent where we're asking you to confirm your marketing preferences to ensure we only contact you via the medium you have chosen i.e.
text or email.
You may also be asked to give your consent when you're entering any sort of competition.
</p>
<p>
When we rely on consent, you'll be asked to confirm that you're happy to provide your personal data and that you give your permission to IMVU to process your personal data.
All of the details such as why IMVU want your data, how it will be used and if your data will be shared will be provided at the time of asking you for your consent.
Where we are relying on consent you will usually see a tick
</p>
<p>
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time if you no longer want to be part of the IMVU processing activity where your consent was sought.
</p>
<p>
<u>Legal Obligation.</u>
</p>
<p>IMVU will on occasion be under a legal obligation to obtain and disclose your personal data.
Where possible, we will notify you when processing your data due to a legal obligation, however this may not always be possible.
For instance, IMVU may need to provide your data in order to prevent criminal activity or help to detect criminal activity, in which case we may share information with law enforcement.
This is done in a safe and secure manner.
It's essential that IMVU complies with its legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, so if you object to this processing, IMVU will not be able to provide its Services to you.
