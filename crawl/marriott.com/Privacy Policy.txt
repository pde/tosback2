The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.
This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.
The sensor does not collect or use any other information.
If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;</li>
