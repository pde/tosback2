</p>
<p>
</p> Understanding Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies <p>We, or our service providers, and other companies we work with may deploy and use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects and other tracking technologies for various purposes, such as fraud prevention and monitoring our advertising and marketing campaign performance.
Some of these tracking tools may detect characteristics or settings of the specific device you use to access our online services.</p>
<ul>
<li> “Cookies” are small amounts of data a website can send to a visitor’s web browser.
 They are often stored on the device you are using to help track your areas of interest.  Cookies may also enable us or our service providers and other companies we work with to relate your use of our online services over time to customize your experience.
 Most web browsers allow you to adjust your browser settings to decline or delete cookies, but doing so may degrade your experience with our online services.<br>
</li>
<li>Clear GIFs, pixel tags or web beacons—which are typically one-pixel, transparent images located on a webpage or in an email or other message—or similar technologies may be used on our sites and in some of our digital communications (such as email or other marketing messages).  They may also be used when you are served advertisements or you otherwise interact with advertisements outside of our online services.  These are principally used to help recognize users, assess traffic patterns and measure site or campaign engagement. </li>
<li>Local Shared Objects, sometimes referred to as “flash cookies” may be stored on your hard drive using a media player or other software installed on your device.  Local Shared Objects are similar to cookies in terms of their operation, but may not be managed in your browser in the same way.  For more information on managing Local Shared Objects, click here.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p> Online Advertising <p>You will see advertisements when you use many of our online services.  These advertisements may be for our own products or services (including pre-screened offers of credit) or for products and services offered by third parties.  Which advertisements you see is often determined using the information we or our affiliates, service providers and other companies that we work with have about you, including information about your relationships with us (e.g., types of accounts held, transactional information, location of banking activity).  To that end, where permitted by applicable law, we may share with others the information we collect from and about you.</p>
<p>Online behavioral advertising (also known as “OBA” or “interest-based advertising”) refers to the practice of collecting information from a computer or device regarding a visitor’s web-browsing activities across non-affiliated websites over time in order to deliver advertisements that may be of interest to that visitor based on their browsing history.
Through OBA, we hope to deliver advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you using information about your other web-browsing activities (e.g., the web pages you visit, search terms you enter, and the way you move through our online services on your computer or device) or your personal profile (e.g., demographic or location information).  Certain companies we work with may set cookies and use related tracking technologies, such as the clear GIFs discussed above, throughout our online services or in our communications to support these OBA efforts.  If you do not want your information collected and used by the companies we work with for OBA purposes, you can opt out of this form of OBA by following the instructions in the next section.</p>
<i>Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising</i>
<p>Certain Chase ads on third-party websites feature an Advertising Options Icon, that when clicked, (i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant third-party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the third parties listed for the purposes of OBA.  If you choose to opt out, our service provider will communicate your opt out election to the relevant third-party advertising partners and a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision to opt out.  Bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and devices that have browsers and you do not wish to have cookies collect information for OBA purposes, <b>you will need to opt out of OBA from each browser on each of the computers and devices that you use</b>.  At Chase, we use the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).  Please note that even if you opt out of OBA, you may still receive advertisements from us.
they just won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites.<br>

</p> Linking to Third-Party Websites <p>Chase may provide links to websites that are owned or operated by other companies ("third-party websites").
 When you use a link online to visit a third-party website, you will be subject to that website’s privacy and security practices, which may differ from ours.
You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy, terms of use and security practices of the linked third-party website before providing any information on that website.</p> Security <p>We use reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect and limit access to personal information.
