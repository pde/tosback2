 Verizon Selects FAQs General Information <ol>
<li> What is Verizon Selects? <p>Verizon Selects helps make marketing you see more personalized and useful to you across the devices and services you use.
This program shares information with Oath (a Verizon company formed by the combination of AOL and Yahoo).<br>
<br>
Verizon Selects uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your wireless device and how you use it - including web addresses of the sites you visit, information about the apps on your device and features you use, as well as device and advertising identifiers.</li>
<br>
<li>Information about your device location including network data and location information transmitted by apps and sites you permit to use your device location.</li>
<br>
<li>Your postal and email addresses.</li>
<br>
<li>Information about your Verizon products and services and how you use them (such as data and calling features and use, Fios service options, equipment and device types).
Some of this information is CPNI (Customer Proprietary Network Information), which is information about the quantity, type, destination, location, and amount of use of your Verizon telecommunications and interconnected voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services and related billing information.</li>
<br>
<li>Information we get from other companies (such as gender, age range, interests, shopping preferences, and ad responses) or that you provide.</li>
<br>
<li>Information advertisers share with us to better target their own advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information may be combined with information collected by Oath advertising services when you access Oath services and visit third-party websites and apps that include Oath advertising services (such as web browsing, app usage, and location), as well as information we obtain from third-party partners and advertisers.
This information is described in the Oath privacy policy.<br>
<br>
The advertising program uses online and device identifiers including browser cookies, advertising IDs from Apple and Google, and one created by Verizon, known as a Unique Identifier Header or UIDH.
Verizon includes a UIDH in the address information of Internet requests going to Verizon companies, including Oath.
When you join Verizon Selects, the UIDH may also be shared with partners who help us provide advertising services.
Verizon partners are authorized to use the UIDH only as part of Verizon and Oath services and not for their own separate uses.
More information about the UIDH can be found here.<br>

We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us.</p>
</li>
<li> Will the Verizon Selects advertising program use information obtained from accessing or reading my emails or texts? <p>As explained in the Oath privacy policy, the program may use de-identified information about Oath services you use to communicate with others, including information from emails.</p>

</li>
<li> What types of devices will receive advertisements? <p>Devices you have on your Verizon Wireless account and those you use to log in to My Verizon will receive ads.
In addition, you may receive advertising on devices you use to connect to Oath sites and services, or on third-party sites where Oath provides advertising services.
If you share your mobile hotspot with others, ads relevant to you may also appear on other connected devices.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li> If I provided my consent to participate in Verizon Selects, and then I turn off the location-based services settings on my mobile device, will my location information still be collected and used for Verizon Selects? <p>This program may use two types of location information.
First, with your permission, it may use location information we collect from apps or mobile websites.
This type of data will not be collected if you turn off the location service settings on your device.
The program also uses location information that Verizon collects from our network.
This type of location information will continue to be used even if you turn off the location service settings on your device.
If you do not want the advertising program to use your location information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the Verizon Selects Preference Center.<br>

You can also instruct Verizon to stop using past data it has collected about your web browsing and location in the Verizon Selects program by visiting the Verizon Selects Preference Center.

<br>
Oath and Verizon also offer apps and other services that involve the collection of location information from your device (for example, MapQuest).
When you turn off location based services on your device or use other device controls, the ad programs will not receive location information from these apps.
Oath advertising services may also use location information provided by advertisers themselves.
