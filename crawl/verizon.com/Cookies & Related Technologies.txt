 Privacy Policy Espanol Cookies &amp.
Related Technologies <p>A cookie is a small data string that is written on your computer hard drive by a web server.
(A web server is the computer that hosts a website and responds to requests received from your computer).
Cookies can play an important role in providing a good customer experience using the web.
Among other things, cookies enable a website to maintain information when a user's web browser requests a series of web pages.
Without cookies, for example, a website owner may not be able to recognize that a user just completed the first step during an online ordering process so that the second step can be presented.</p>
<p>Cookies generally hold information, including data strings that contain a unique user ID which allow websites, including Verizon websites, to customize your experiences on the sites and gather information about your navigation of the sites.
For example, cookies allow us, and others who place and access cookies on our sites, to deliver advertising and other content specific to your interests, keep track of your online ordering and alert you to new products or promotional opportunities based on your current services.
Verizon websites may use different kinds of cookies, including HTTP cookies (also known as browser cookies) and Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies that are built for use with the Adobe® Flash® Player.</p>
<p>Information gathered from cookies also helps us understand how our sites are performing and provides usage information to help us customize and improve our sites.
We also use cookies to help verify the identity of a website user or to recognize you as a registered user and remember your settings and preference.</p>
Managing cookies
<p>You can manage cookies by using features and functions available on most Internet browsers.
For example, most browsers will allow you to choose what cookies can be placed on your computer and to delete or disable cookies.
You can find instructions for managing cookie controls on websites for particular browsers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers</li>
<li>Apple Safari browsers</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our sites and other websites, such as ordering products or services and maintaining an online account.
Cookies must be enabled for you to use your Verizon e-mail account.

Web beacons
<p>Verizon and third-party advertisers may use web beacons.
Some Verizon websites contain web beacons in the form of clear .gif files, which are electronic images that allow for the collection of information about your interactions on our sites.
Web beacons may be used to place advertisements, to understand website traffic patterns and the number of visitors to our website, and to measure the effectiveness of advertisements or email advertising messages.<br> </p>
Social networks and other third-party plug-ins and widgets
<p>Verizon websites also include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about the Verizon page you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget and regardless of whether you have an account or other relationship with these social networks and third-parties.
Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL of the web page where the plug-in or widget appears.
If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use and share.<br> </p>
Device fingerprinting and device graphs
<p>Verizon and third-party advertisers may use “statistical identifiers” or device fingerprinting technologies that use attributes about your device and browser to recognize your device or browser over time.
Such techniques may or may not be used in conjunction with cookies or other local storage technologies.
Device graph or "device correlation" uses techniques that look at IP addresses and related data to determine if multiple devices may relate to the same user.
This can enable the customization and delivery of ads, and other functions.</p>
