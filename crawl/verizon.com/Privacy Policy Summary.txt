 Privacy Policy Español Privacy Policy Summary <p>At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers.
Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.</p>
<p>Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors, app users, applicants and customers in the United States.  It applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services we provide, except it does not apply to our Oath or Visible affiliates which have separate privacy policies. In addition, some Verizon services and apps, such as hum, Message+ and AppFlash have additional privacy practices that are presented separately. If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the service-specific policies, the service-specific policy governs when you are using that service.</p>
<p>A separate policy governs the collection of personal data from individuals located outside of the United States by the Verizon family of companies. Also, contracts between Verizon and its business customers (both U.S.
and international) may contain additional privacy-related terms and conditions that are presented in other ways.
The Verizon-owned Oath company has its own privacy policy.  </p>
<p>Below, we've summarized key elements from our full privacy policy for your convenience.</p>
