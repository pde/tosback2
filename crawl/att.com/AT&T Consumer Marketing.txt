</p> AT&amp;T Consumer Marketing
<p>AT&amp;T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective residential customers who request not to receive any AT&amp;T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers must contact the AT&amp;T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.</li>
<li>Generally AT&amp;T processes DNM requests within 30 days.
However, because our mailings are processed well in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.'<ul>
<li>Please note that AT&amp;T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip codes.
These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code.
You may continue to receive this type of mailing even if you opt-out of receiving marketing related postal mailings from AT&amp;T.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from the date of request.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T DNM requests will expire upon change of address.</li>
</ul>
<p>AT&amp;T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&amp;T vendors responsible for direct mail marketing on AT&amp;T's behalf.</p>
<p>Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM Policy.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy.</p>
