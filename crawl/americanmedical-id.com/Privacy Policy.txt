<p>
<strong>The information American Medical ID collects and how:</strong>
</p>
<p>When you order a medical ID or other product from us, you must include personal information on an order form, whether a paper form that you mail or fax to us, a form filled in for you by our customer service staff via phone, or an online form.
Order forms ask for your name, gender, billing address, email address, shipping and payment information, such as your credit card number.
</p>
<p>Order forms also include information that you have us engrave on your medical ID, which usually includes personal health information and may include contact information for relatives, friends or health care professionals.
We store an accurate record of what you have us engrave on an ID alongside your name and the other personal information that you give us.
</p>
<p>Our order forms display promotion codes that tell us where customers got their forms.
These codes remain attached to personally identifiable information, as do responses to the question on our website "Where did you hear about us?".
</p>
<p>We collect aggregate data from our website as well as from order forms that are mailed, faxed or phoned in to us.
This data is not attached to any personally identifiable information, except in the case of the promotion codes described immediately above.
</p>
<p>We collect personal contact information on our website, including Name, Address, Telephone and Email Address.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we conduct voluntary online surveys on our website or send out surveys by email to past customers who have told us that we may email them.
These surveys collect no personally identifiable information unless it is volunteered by a respondent, and we use only aggregate data collected from each survey.
</p>
<p>We log all communications with our customers, whether by Live Chat, telephone, mail or email.
We do this simply in order to keep a record of these exchanges or to train customer service staff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Service Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>American Medical ID utilizes outside service providers for billing, shipping marketing services, Web analytics and Web hosting.
These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Blogs</strong>
</p>
<p>If you use a bulletin board, blog or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users of these forms, and could be used to send you unsolicted messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at PrivacyOfficer@IdentifyYourself.com.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<strong>Cookies and other online tracking devices:</strong>
</p>
<p>Many websites, including ours, gather information from online visitors through cookies and tracking devices.
A cookie is a small text file sent to your computer that allows a specific task to be carried out.
Tracking devices are computer codes that trace how web visitors arrive at and use a website.
</p>
<p>Our website uses session cookies to help you navigate our site and to keep track of selections for our products.
Session cookies are temporary.
They expire when you close your browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.).
</p>
<p>We use persistent cookies to save any information you type into our online order form.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer for a short time, even after you close your browser.
We use them so that information you type into an order form will not have to be re-entered after you leave our site and return later.
Our persistent cookies automatically expire if an order is not completed within the short period defined by the cookie or after an order is completed.
</p>
<p>Cookies also track orders and shipping within our system.
This allows us to be more efficient in handling and shipping orders and allows us to keep customers informed about the progress of their orders.
We don't use these cookies in any other way.
</p>
<p>Your browser lets you erase or even block cookies if you don't want them on your computer.
(Check the instructions in your browser's help menu for how to do this.) However, our website requires use of cookies if you want to order from us.
If you block cookies, you will be able to see most parts of our website, but you will not be able to place an order online.

This practice helps us improve access to our web pages.
These tracking devices also record use of promotions and discounts offered for our products through other websites.
In addition, we track how web visitors use our site in order to learn what works and what doesn't in our ordering and purchasing processes.
In no case do we gather personally identifiable information via tracking devices.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>Technologies such as: scripts are used by American Medical ID and our partners [Google Analytics, Google AdWords], affiliates, or analytics or service providers [online customer support provider, Live Chat].
These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
</p>
<p>Log Files - As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.</p>

<p>Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSs.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by Clicking Here.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>We use respected service providers outside of our company to verify credit card information and to detect fraudulent use of personal information.
</p>
<p>We use additional in-house security measures to protect personal information stored in our electronic databases.
</p>
<p>We limit in-house access to personally identifiable information to staff directly responsible for processing orders, obtaining payments or maintaining our database.

<p>
<strong>How we use the personal information you give us:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our primary reason for collecting personally identifiable information (PII) is to fill orders for our products.
We use the PII you give us to confirm your order, to produce IDs, to collect payment, to tell you about the progress of your order and to ship it to you.
All of the information we request from you is necessary for these purposes.
</p>
<p>We require, in particular, your email address and phone number so that we can contact you if we have questions about your order.
We might contact you, for example, if we find a mistake or inconsistency in the information you provide for engraving your ID.
Your well-being depends on the accuracy of that information, and we want to be sure that your ID will work for you when needed.
</p>
<p>If you order an ID that will be worn by someone else, we retain any information you have us engrave on an ID for that person, but we don't use this data in any way once your order for the ID has been filled.
Nor do we ever use contact information for relatives or health care providers that you place on an ID except to engrave your ID.
</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
After your order has been completed, American Medical ID must store your personally identifiable information (PII) in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

This section describes the reasons for which we might contact you and outlines the restrictions we place on ourselves in contacting our customers.
</p>
<p>We will not phone you once your order has been completed.
</p>
<p>To those who want to hear from us, we use the names and addresses of our customers to mail or email an occasional newsletter.
At times, we may send information targeted to people with specific health conditions.
We also occasionally send out commercial offers or promotions for products likely to interest our customers.
and from time to time we send out surveys.

Should you not want to continue receiving our mailings, every mail or email we send contains the mechanism for unsubscribing from our mailing list.
In the case of email, you will merely click on an "unsubscribe" button contained in every American Medical ID mailing.
Postal mail will display an address for an unsubscribe request (American Medical ID, 949 Wakefield, Suite100, Houston, TX 77018).

<strong>How we treat personal health information:</strong>
</p>
<p>Once your ID has been completed, we use your personal health information (which we get only through information engraved on your ID) to identify customers who are likely to appreciate receiving information about a specific health condition or about certain health products from us.
We use personally identifiable health information for no other purpose.
</p>
<p>You should be aware that even the initial mailing you receive from us after purchasing an ID may be related to the health information you have us engrave on it.
While this initial mailing is a condition of buying from our company, you will be given the means for unsubscribing from our mailing list within that first mail or email you receive from us, including from news targeted to your health condition.
The means for unsubscribing is described above.
</p>
<p>Even after initially allowing use of your health-related PII for mailings targeted to your condition, you may ask not to receive mail or email related to your health condition.
Every mailing to you will include a simple means for unsubscribing from our mailing list, as described above.
</p>
<p>American Medical ID sometimes cooperates with health organizations in educating people about specific health conditions.
We also work with other commercial companies in promoting health products.
These activities involve mailings to customers targeted by the information engraved on an ID (but only those who have permitted us to communicate with them).
However, we do such cooperative mailings ourselves so that our customers' personally identifiable information does not leave our hands.

In those cases, we track the information that a visitor arrived at our website through a particular organization's link in order to record the discount due, to take a customer to the correct web page for a promotion that interests him or her, or to credit the other organization for providing links to our website.

The promotion codes that appear on our order forms tell us where a customer got the form and if the code is part of a promotion for our products.

</p>
<p>We use information gathered from surveys (posted on our website or distributed by email) only in aggregate.
Responses given on surveys cannot be traced to any individual, unless a survey participant volunteered to give us contact information.
