Your California Privacy Rights</b>
</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

<p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.</p>
<p>
<b>13.
