</p> Stuff not to do <p> If someone else might own the copyright to it, don’t upload it.

Don’t hotlink to such content, or to file-sharing or torrent sites.
Don’t be a troll or a jerk.
Don't impersonate someone else.
If you do (and we will be the judge), or if you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on Imgur.com.

This means that if you upload an image to share with your friend, only your friend will be able to access it online.
However, if you share an image with Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc, then it may end up in the gallery.
