</p> Types of Information Collected <p> In order to provide this site and our numerous services, we collect two types of information on our site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
 Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Personally Identifiable Information:</em>
</strong> This refers to information that identifies or can potentially be used to identify, contact or locate you.
 When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.
 It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities.
however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, and other personally identifying information.
 When ordering products or services on the site, you may also be asked to provide payment information.
 Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.
 If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</em>
</strong> This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.
This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis.
 This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to next, demographic information, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.
 A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.
 An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a network, such as the World Wide Web.
 An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer.
 Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p> Collection Methods and Use of Information <p> We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you on this site unless you voluntarily provide it to us.
 You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register for our services and register your e-mail address with us.
(b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners.
(c) sign up for special offers from us or from selected third parties.
(d) send e-mail messages, submit forms, post to forums, or transmit other information by telephone, e-mail or letter.
or (e) submit your payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our site.
 We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.
</p>
<p>In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
  We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, to administer our site, and to gather demographic information.
 Our third-party ad servers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our site.</p>
<p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to (a) to provide our services to you.
(b) to allow us to properly maintain this site and our services and to make improvements or upgrades when necessary.
(c) to provide you with technical support and for system maintenance.
(d) to inform you of new products or services that may be of interest to you.
(e) to respond to your inquiries or send administrative notices.
(f) to prevent fraud, including the unauthorized use of this site or our services or violations of applicable policies and terms of service.
or (g) to ensure our own compliance with the law.
 We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including any website terms of use or this Privacy Policy.</p> Release of Information <p> We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have affirmatively agreed to such disclosure.
 Charter may disclosure your Personally Identifiable Information with some of our same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes.
 We do provide some of our services or provide parts of this site through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties.
 We and our service partners may use your Personally Identifiable Information to deliver these services and to operate our site.
</p>
<p>As part of our business activities, if we enter into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information associated with the transaction.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.
 We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, or when otherwise permitted by applicable law.
 We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use this site for illegal activities.
 We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
</p> User Choices on Collection and Use of Information <p> If you do not wish to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this site, then you should not provide it when requested or otherwise provide your information to this site.  However, some parts of this site or our service may not function without the requested information.  We may, from time to time, send you marketing messages (e.g., email, direct mail, telephone calls, etc.) regarding our products and services.
  If you do not want to receive these marketing messages from Charter, please follow the opt-out instructions in the message or designate your Charter opt-out request by visiting unsubscribe.charter.com.  For more information about targeted marketing see below.</p> Security of Information <p> Charter takes the security of your Personally Identifiable Information seriously.  We take such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter and its service providers to Personally Identifiable Information.  Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information when it collects such information over this site.  Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods.  Charter limits access to databases containing Personally Identifiable Information to authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the use and release sections above.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

(b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed.
and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with by a third party while in transit.</p>
