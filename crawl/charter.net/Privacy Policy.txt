If you find the changes unacceptable and if those changes materially and adversely impact Your use of the Service, You may have the right to cancel Your Service under Your Service Agreement.

Examples of non-personal information include IP addresses, MAC addresses or other equipment identifiers, among other data.
Our systems may automatically collect certain non-personal information when You use an interactive or transactional service.

<p>If You subscribe to our video service, then in certain of our systems, our set-top boxes automatically collect information that may be used to determine which programs are most popular, how many set-top boxes are tuned to watch a program to its conclusion and whether commercials are being watched, as well as other audience-measurement focused information.
Our processes are designed to track this information and audience statistics on an anonymous basis.
Information such as channel tuning, the time the channel is changed, and when the set-top box is "on" or "off" is collected at a secure database in an anonymous format.
Charter, or our contractors or agents, may from time to time share the anonymous information with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship.

<ul>

<li>comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as for the general administration of our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>If You use an interactive or transactional service, for example, responding to a survey or ordering a pay-per-view event, the system will collect certain additional personally identifiable information, such as account and billing information or Customer-provided locale and service preferences, to properly bill You for the services purchased and to provide You with a more personalized experience.
In addition, certain information such as Your connections to our system is automatically collected to, for example, make it possible for Your digital boxes to receive and process the signals for the services You order.</p>
<p>Charter may also collect personally identifiable information from third parties to enhance our customer database for use in marketing and other activities.
Charter also collects personally identifiable information from third parties to verify information You have provided us and collects personally identifiable information from credit reporting agencies to, for example, determine Your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage.
Charter also may maintain research records containing information obtained through voluntary subscriber interviews or surveys.
</p>
<p>If You subscribe to our high-speed Internet service, Charter transmits personally identifiable and non-personal identifiable information about You over the Service when You send and receive e-mail and instant messages, transfer and share files, make files accessible, visit websites, or otherwise use the Service and its features.
Our transmission of this information is necessary to allow You to use the Service as You have chosen and to render the Service to You.</p> Who sees the information collected by Charter? <p>Charter will only disclose personally identifiable information to others if: (a) Customer provides written or electronic consent in advance, or (b) it is permitted or required under federal or applicable state law.
Specifically, federal law allows Charter to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties: </p>
<ul>
<li>when it is necessary to provide Charter's services or to carry out Charter's business activities;</li>
<li>as required by law or legal process.
or </li>
<li>for mailing list or other purposes, subject to Your ability to limit this last type of disclosure.</li>
</ul>

software vendors.
program and other service suppliers for audit purposes.
marketers of Charter's products and services.
third party auditors.
our attorneys and accountants.
and/or strategic partners offering or providing products or services jointly or on behalf of Charter.
The frequency of disclosures varies according to business needs, and may involve access on a regular basis.
Charter restricts third parties' use of Your information to the purposes for which it is disclosed and prohibits third parties from further disclosure or use of Your personally identifiable information obtained from us, whether for that third party's own marketing purposes or otherwise.</p>
<p>Unless You object in advance, federal law also allows Charter to disclose through "mailing lists," personally identifiable information, such as Your name, address and the level of Your service subscription, to non-affiliated entities, including advertisers and marketing entities, for non-service related purposes, including product advertisement, direct marketing and research.
Under no circumstances will Charter disclose to these advertising entities the extent of Your viewing habits or the transactions You make over the system.
Charter, or our contractors or agents, may from time to time share non-personal and/or aggregate information such as the number of Service subscribers who match certain statistical profiles (for example, the number of subscribers in various parts of the country) with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship.
</p>
<p>We may provide anonymous data to third parties who may combine it with other information to conduct more comprehensive audience analysis for us and for television advertisers.
This data helps program networks and cable operators decide on which programs, channels, and advertising to carry.
Charter may also use that information to distribute targeted advertising to You without having disclosed any of Your personally identifiable information to the advertisers.
These advertisements may invite interactive or transactional follow-up from You.
By using any of Charter's interactive services, You consent to our collection of this additional information.
Unless You consent first or except as required by law, only anonymous information is disclosed to audience measurement services.</p>
<p>As part of its business activities, if Charter enters into a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Charter may transfer Customers' personally identifiable and non-personal information as part of the transaction.</p>
<p>If You subscribe to our telephone service, Your name, address and/or telephone number may be transmitted via Caller ID, published and distributed in affiliated or unaffiliated telephone directories, and available through affiliated or unaffiliated directory assistance operators.
We take reasonable precautions to ensure that non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in the telephone directories or directory assistance services, although we cannot guarantee that errors will never occur.
Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of Your name and/or telephone number when You dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 866, 877 or 888 numbers.
</p>
<p>If allowed by and after complying with any federal law requirements, Charter may disclose personally identifiable information about Customer to representatives of government or to comply with valid legal process, except as provided below, disclosures shall not include records revealing Customer's selection of video programming.
Disclosures to representatives of government may be made pursuant to an administrative subpoena, warrant, court order, our reasonable discretion in cases of emergency or serious physical injury, or other permitted means.
In these situations, Charter may be required to disclose personally identifiable information about a Customer without Customer's consent and without notice to the Customer.
Law enforcement agencies may, by federal or state court order, and without notice to You, obtain the right to install a device that monitors Your Internet and e-mail use, including addresses of email sent and received and in some cases the content of those communications.
and/or Your use of our telephone service, including listings of incoming and outgoing calls and in some cases the content of those calls.
In some instances where there are valid legal requests for or orders for disclosure of Your information, we may notify You of the requests or orders and then it may be up to You to object or take specific action to prevent any disclosures pursuant to those requests or orders.</p>
<p>Where a governmental entity is seeking personally identifiable information of a Customer who subscribes to Charter's video services only or records revealing Customer's selection of video programming, the Cable Act requires a court order and that the video subscriber be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made in support of the court order.
At such a proceeding, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to offer clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the prosecution of the case.
Except in certain situations (such as with respect to those who owe, or are owed, welfare or child support) state welfare agencies may obtain the names, addresses, and certain other Customer information as it appears in Charter's subscriber records under the authority of an administrative subpoena.
</p>
<p>We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about You without Your consent (a) to protect our Customers, employees, or property, (b) in emergency situations, (c) to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with You, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies and/or (d) in order to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or as otherwise required by law, for example, as part of a regulatory proceeding.</p> Note to California Customers Regarding Your Privacy Rights: <p>California law requires Charter provide to certain Customers, upon request, certain information regarding the sharing of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
As mentioned above, Charter does not share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
However, Charter may share personally identifiable information with some same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes (and, if a Charter telephone subscriber, then subject to the restrictions in the attached CPNI Policy).
If You make a request by phone or on-line, Charter will provide You with the number of its same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personal information that it may have shared with some or all such affiliates.
</p> Can I prohibit or limit Charter? use and disclosure of my personally identifiable information? <p>If You do not want Your name, address, level of service or other personally identiable information disclosed to third parties in a "mailing list" as explained above, please register this preference at http://unsubscribe.charter.com or by contacting us by telephone at 1-888-GET-CHARTER.

Please note that such request will not eliminate all telephone calls, emails or direct mail sent to You from Charter as Charter may still continue to send non-marketing account-related messages to You.
</p> How long does Charter maintain personally identifiable information? <p>Charter will maintain personally identifiable information about You as long as You are a subscriber to Charter's Service and as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
If You are no longer a subscriber to any Charter Service and the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, Charter will only keep personally identifiable information as long as necessary to comply with laws governing our business.
These laws include, but are not limited to, tax and accounting requirements that require record retention.
Charter will also maintain personally identifiable information to satisfy pending requests for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order.
Charter will destroy Customers' personally identifiable information when the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, when there are no longer pending requests for such information, and when it is no longer necessary to retain the information under applicable laws.
</p> How does Charter protect customer information? <p>Charter takes the security of our Customers' personally identifiable information seriously.
Charter takes such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter to personally identifiable information.
Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive personally identifiable information when it collects such information over the system.
Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods.
Charter limits access to databases containing Customers' personally identifiable information to those specifically authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the "Who sees the information collected by Charter?" section above.

<p> </p> Charter Residential Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) Policy <p>TThe following CPNI Policy is in addition to requirements set forth in Charter's Residential Subscriber Privacy Policy and is subject to some permitted uses and disclosures of Your name, address, and/or telephone number outlined in the Privacy Policy.
The information that we have (1) relating to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of Your use of telephone service, and / or (2) contained on Your telephone bill concerning the telephone services that You receive is subject to additional privacy protections.
That information, when matched to Your name, address, and telephone number is known as "Customer Proprietary Network Information," or CPNI for short.
Examples of CPNI include information typically available from details on a customer's monthly telephone bill -- the type of line, technical characteristics, class of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns.
As a subscriber to our telephone services, You have the right, and Charter has a duty, under federal law to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.
Charter offers many communications-related services, such as, for example, Charter Internet services.
From time to time we would like to use the CPNI information we have on file to provide You with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions.
Our use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to Your specific needs.
We would like Your approval so that we, our agents, affiliates, joint venture partners, and independent contractors may use this CPNI to let You know about communications-related services other than those to which You currently subscribe that we believe may be of interest to You.
You do have the right to restrict this use of CPNI.
</p>
<p>IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS NOTIFICATION, WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED SERVICES.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISAPPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI, AND MAY DENY OR WITHDRAW OUR RIGHT TO USE YOUR CPNI AT ANY TIME BY CALLING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER REFLECTED ON YOUR MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT OR 1-888-GET-CHARTER.
We will also honor any restrictions applied by state law, to the extent applicable.
Charter also offers various other services that are not related to the communications services to which You subscribe.
Under the CPNI rules, some of those services, such as Charter video services, are considered to be non-communications related services.
Occasionally, You may be asked during a telephone call with one of our representatives for Your oral consent to Charter's use of Your CPNI for the purpose of providing You with an offer for products or services not related to the telephone services to which You subscribe.
If You provide Your oral consent for Charter to do so, Charter may use Your CPNI for the duration of such telephone call in order to offer You additional services.
Any action that You take to deny or restrict approval to use Your CPNI will not affect our provision to You, now or in the future, of any service to which You subscribe.
You may disregard this notice if You previously contacted us in response to a CPNI Notification and denied use of Your CPNI for the purposes described above.
Any denial of approval for use of Your CPNI outside of the service to which You already subscribe is valid until such time as Your telephone services are discontinued or You affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial.
The CPNI Policy above may be required by law to apply to our Voice over Internet Protocol, or, IP voice services.

Charter also collects personally identifiable information from third parties to verify information You have provided us and collects personally identifiable information from credit reporting agencies to, for example, determine Your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage.
Charter also may maintain research records containing information obtained through voluntary subscriber interviews or surveys.</p>
<p>If You subscribe to our high-speed Internet service, Charter transmits personally identifiable and non-personal identifiable information about You over the Service when You send and receive e-mail and instant messages, transfer and share files, make files accessible, visit websites, or otherwise use the Service and its features.
Our transmission of this information is necessary to allow You to use the Service as You have chosen and to render the Service to You.</p> Who sees the information collected by Charter? <p>Charter will only disclose personally identifiable information to others if: (a) Customer provides written or electronic consent in advance, or (b) it is permitted or required under federal or applicable state law.
Specifically, federal law allows Charter to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties: </p>
<ul>
<li>when it is necessary to provide Charter's services or to carry out Charter's business activities;</li>
<li>as required by law or legal process.
or </li>
<li>for mailing list or other purposes, subject to Your ability to limit this last type of disclosure.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide services and carry out our business activities, certain authorized people have access to Your information, including our employees, entities affiliated through common ownership or control with Charter and third parties that provide and/or include: billing and collection services.
installation, repair and customer service subcontractors or agents.
program guide distributors.
software vendors.
program and other service suppliers for audit purposes.
marketers of Charter's products and services.
third party auditors.
our attorneys and accountants.
and/or strategic partners offering or providing products or services jointly or on behalf of Charter.
The frequency of disclosures varies according to business needs, and may involve access on a regular basis.
Charter restricts third parties' use of Your information to the purposes for which it is disclosed and prohibits third parties from further disclosure or use of Your personally identifiable information obtained from us, whether for that third party's own marketing purposes or otherwise.
</p>
<p>Unless You object in advance, federal law also allows Charter to disclose through "mailing lists," personally identifiable information, such as Your name, address and the level of Your service subscription, to non-affiliated entities, including advertisers and marketing entities, for non-service related purposes, including product advertisement, direct marketing and research.
Under no circumstances will Charter disclose to these advertising entities the extent of Your viewing habits or the transactions You make over the system.
Charter, or our contractors or agents, may from time to time share non-personal and/or aggregate information such as the number of Service subscribers who match certain statistical profiles (for example, the number of subscribers in various parts of the country) with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship.</p>
<p>We may provide anonymous data to third parties who may combine it with other information to conduct more comprehensive audience analysis for us and for television advertisers.
This data helps program networks and cable operators decide on which programs, channels, and advertising to carry.
Charter may also use that information to distribute targeted advertising to You without having disclosed any of Your personally identifiable information to the advertisers.
These advertisements may invite interactive or transactional follow-up from You.
By using any of Charter's interactive services, You consent to our collection of this additional information.
Unless You consent first or except as required by law, only anonymous information is disclosed to audience measurement services.</p>
<p>As part of its business activities, if Charter enters into a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Charter may transfer Customers' personally identifiable and non-personal information as part of the transaction.</p>
<p>If You subscribe to our telephone service, Your name, address and/or telephone number may be transmitted via Caller ID, published and distributed in affiliated or unaffiliated telephone directories, and available through affiliated or unaffiliated directory assistance operators.
We take reasonable precautions to ensure that non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in the telephone directories or directory assistance services, although we cannot guarantee that errors will never occur.
Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of Your name and/or telephone number when You dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 866, 877 or 888 numbers.
</p>
<p>If allowed by and after complying with any federal law requirements, Charter may disclose personally identifiable information about Customer to representatives of government or to comply with valid legal process, except as provided below, disclosures shall not include records revealing Customer's selection of video programming.
Disclosures to representatives of government may be made pursuant to an administrative subpoena, warrant, court order, our reasonable discretion in cases of emergency or serious physical injury, or other permitted means.
In these situations, Charter may be required to disclose personally identifiable information about a Customer without Customer's consent and without notice to the Customer.
Law enforcement agencies may, by federal or state court order, and without notice to You, obtain the right to install a device that monitors Your Internet and e-mail use, including addresses of email sent and received and in some cases the content of those communications.
and/or Your use of our telephone service, including listings of incoming and outgoing calls and in some cases the content of those calls.
In some instances where there are valid legal requests for or orders for disclosure of Your information, we may notify You of the requests or orders and then it may be up to You to object or take specific action to prevent any disclosures pursuant to those requests or orders.</p>
<p>Where a governmental entity is seeking personally identifiable information of a Customer who subscribes to Charter's video services only or records revealing Customer's selection of video programming, the Cable Act requires a court order and that the video subscriber be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made in support of the court order.
At such a proceeding, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to offer clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the prosecution of the case.
Except in certain situations (such as with respect to those who owe, or are owed, welfare or child support) state welfare agencies may obtain the names, addresses, and certain other Customer information as it appears in Charter's subscriber records under the authority of an administrative subpoena.
</p>
<p>We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about You without Your consent (a) to protect our Customers, employees, or property, (b) in emergency situations, (c) to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with You, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies and/or (d) in order to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or as otherwise required by law, for example, as part of a regulatory proceeding.
</p> Note to California Customers Regarding Your Privacy Rights: <p>California law requires Charter provide to certain Customers, upon request, certain information regarding the sharing of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
As mentioned above, Charter does not share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
However, Charter may share personally identifiable information with some same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes (and, if a Charter telephone subscriber, then subject to the restrictions in the attached CPNI Policy).
If You make a request by phone or on-line, Charter will provide You with the number of its same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personal information that it may have shared with some or all such affiliates.</p> Can I prohibit or limit Charter's use and disclosure of my personally identifiable information? <p>If You do not want Your name, address, level of service or other personally identifiable information disclosed to third parties in a "mailing list" as explained above, please register this preference at http://unsubscribe.charter.com or by contacting us by telephone at 1 888 GET CHARTER.
Customers of our video service cannot opt-out of the collection of audience measurement data.</p>
<p>Also, if You do not want to receive marketing messages (e.g., phone calls, emails, and direct mail) from Charter, You may call 1-888-GET-CHARTER or visit http://unsubscribe.charter.com and make a request to have Your privacy preferences updated.
Please note that such request will not eliminate all telephone calls, emails or direct mail sent to You from Charter as Charter may still continue to send non-marketing account-related messages to You.</p> How long does Charter maintain personally identifiable information? <p>Charter will maintain personally identifiable information about You as long as You are a subscriber to Charter's Service and as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
If You are no longer a subscriber to any Charter Service and the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, Charter will only keep personally identifiable information as long as necessary to comply with laws governing our business.
These laws include, but are not limited to, tax and accounting requirements that require record retention.
Charter will also maintain personally identifiable information to satisfy pending requests for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order.
Charter will destroy Customers' personally identifiable information when the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, when there are no longer pending requests for such information, and when it is no longer necessary to retain the information under applicable laws.</p> How does Charter protect customer information? <p>Charter takes the security of our Customers' personally identifiable information seriously.
Charter takes such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter to personally identifiable information.
Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive personally identifiable information when it collects such information over the system.
Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods.
Charter limits access to databases containing Customers' personally identifiable information to those specifically authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the "Who sees the information collected by Charter?" section above.
However, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>You need to help protect the privacy of Your own information.
You and others who use Your equipment must not give identifying information to strangers or others whom You are not certain have a right or need to the information.
You also must take precautions to protect the security of any personally identifiable information that You may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of Your personally identifiable information.
You are responsible for the security of Your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks in Your home.
For more information on things You can do to help protect the privacy of Your own information, visit www.charter.com/security or www.OnGuardOnline.gov.</p> Can I see the information that Charter collects about me? <p>You have a right under the Cable Act to see Your personally identifiable information that Charter collects and maintains.

At those specific parts of our Service, Charter will provide a special notice or other information describing the additional privacy protections that may apply.
Charter urges children to always obtain a parent or legal guardian's permission before sending any information about themselves over the Internet and urges parents and legal guardians to be vigilant regarding children's Internet usage.
Other services or web pages accessed through Charter's Service may have different policies on collection of information pertaining to children and You should consult their privacy policies and read their notices if You have any concerns about the collection or use of such information by those entities.</p> How does Charter use cookies and web beacons? <p>A cookie is a small file that stores information in Your browser on Your computer.

We may also combine that information with personally identifiable information, such as information You provide Charter and from Your Charter account.
(See "What type of Information does Charter Collect").
In addition, Charter may partner with third-party advertising companies who may utilize cookies, web beacons, or other technology to deliver or facilitate the delivery of targeted advertisements.

You should review the privacy policy applicable to each site, which is available under the "Your Privacy Rights" or "Privacy Policy" section of each Charter website.
This Policy also does not apply to those residential customers who subscribe to Charter's residential video programming, high-speed Internet and/or telephone service.
The Residential Subscriber Privacy Policy is available under the "Your Privacy Rights" section of www.charter.com.</p>
<p>Effective: April 10, 2012</p> Charter Residential Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) Policy <p>The following CPNI Policy is in addition to requirements set forth in Charter's Commercial Subscriber Privacy Policy and is subject to some permitted uses and disclosures of Your name, address, and/or telephone number outlined in the Privacy Policy.
The information that we have (1) relating to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of Your use of telephone service, and / or (2) contained on Your telephone bill concerning the telephone services that You receive is subject to additional privacy protections.
That information, when matched to Your name, address, and telephone number is known as "Customer Proprietary Network Information," or CPNI for short.
Examples of CPNI include information typically available from details on a customer's monthly telephone bill -- the type of line, technical characteristics, class of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns.
As a subscriber to our telephone services, You have the right, and Charter has a duty, under federal law to protect the confidentiality of CPNI.
Charter offers many communications-related services, such as, for example, Charter Internet services.
From time to time we would like to use the CPNI information we have on file to provide You with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions.
Our use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to Your specific needs.
We would like Your approval so that we, our agents, affiliates, joint venture partners, and independent contractors may use this CPNI to let You know about communications-related services other than those to which You currently subscribe that we believe may be of interest to You.
You do have the right to restrict this use of CPNI.
</p>
<p>IIF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS NOTIFICATION, WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED SERVICES.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISAPPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI, AND MAY DENY OR WITHDRAW OUR RIGHT TO USE YOUR CPNI AT ANY TIME BY CALLING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER REFLECTED ON YOUR MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT OR 1-888-GET-CHARTER.
We will also honor any restrictions applied by state law, to the extent applicable.
Charter also offers various other services that are not related to the communications services to which You subscribe.
Under the CPNI rules, some of those services, such as Charter video services, are considered to be non-communications related services.
Occasionally, You may be asked during a telephone call with one of our representatives for Your oral consent to Charter's use of Your CPNI for the purpose of providing You with an offer for products or services not related to the telephone services to which You subscribe.
If You provide Your oral consent for Charter to do so, Charter may use Your CPNI for the duration of such telephone call in order to offer You additional services.
Any action that You take to deny or restrict approval to use Your CPNI will not affect our provision to You, now or in the future, of any service to which You subscribe.
You may disregard this notice if You previously contacted us in response to a CPNI Notification and denied use of Your CPNI for the purposes described above.
Any denial of approval for use of Your CPNI outside of the service to which You already subscribe is valid until such time as Your telephone services are discontinued or You affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial.
The CPNI Policy above may be required by law to apply to our Voice over Internet Protocol, or, IP voice services.</p>

 We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
</p> User Choices on Collection and Use of Information <p> If you do not wish to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this site, then you should not provide it when requested or otherwise provide your information to this site.  However, some parts of this site or our service may not function without the requested information.  We may, from time to time, send you marketing messages (e.g., email, direct mail, telephone calls, etc.) regarding our products and services.
  If you do not want to receive these marketing messages from Charter, please follow the opt-out instructions in the message or designate your Charter opt-out request by visiting unsubscribe.charter.com.  For more information about targeted marketing see below.</p> Security of Information <p> Charter takes the security of your Personally Identifiable Information seriously.  We take such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter and its service providers to Personally Identifiable Information.  Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information when it collects such information over this site.  Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods.  Charter limits access to databases containing Personally Identifiable Information to authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the use and release sections above.  </p>
