For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders.</p>
<p>On our BBW social media pages we may collect information about you and, if you allow, about your friends on the social media site, through (1) an application or form accessed through a BBW social media page which links to this privacy policy, and (2) through the BBW shopping page located on certain BBW social media pages.</p>

This published content could identify details concerning you.</p>
<p>
<strong>     2.
Information We Observe or Collect through Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>          a.
Navigational and Location Information</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit this Web site or an online channel where this policy is linked, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate.
Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you.
However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.
When collecting the IP address, we may also be able to determine location information such as city, state, country, a designated marketing area and the ISP being used.
We will also collect the type of mobile device you are using when connecting to our mobile website so we can provide the mobile website version best suited for your device.</p>
<p>
<strong>          b.
Cookies and Clear gifs</strong>
</p>
<p>To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie.
A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer or device.
It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, and remember you and your online purchases when you return.
This helps us improve our site, provide better Customer Care, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes, location and/or purchase history.</p>
<p>We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon, pixel tags or Web bug) on our Web site, mobile site, microsites, and BBW social media pages and in our emails.
A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or email message.
It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed.
Clear gifs in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.
and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.</p>
<p>Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most: for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites.
and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site.
We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.
To opt out of our cookies used for this online advertising, click here.</p>
<p>Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide or we otherwise collect (such as name, address, phone number, email address, and IP address).
We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you.
to improve our business.
to transact business.
and to market our products and services to you on this and other Web sites and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail.
As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag.
That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart.
We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences.
The end-result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</p>
<p>
<strong>     3.
Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>We evaluate and select third-party service providers to help us analyze our visitors' site and purchase preferences.
For example, we use analytics companies to better understand our customers' use of our Web sites, mobile sites, microsites, BBW social media pages and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets.
We also use third parties so that we can evaluate and understand customers' purchases in order to provide tailored offers and information, based on unique preferences.

They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology.

<p>
<strong>HOW IS TECHNOLOGY USED TO SERVE OUR ADVERTISEMENTS ON OTHER WEB SITES AND WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE?</strong>
</p>
<p>We contract with third-party advertising companies to deliver tailored online display and banner advertising to you on other Web sites.
To serve this advertising, these third party companies place, use, or rely on technology, such as cookies and clear gifs, as customers interact with us through our Web sites and interact with other Web sites.
Once this information is gathered, it helps us select tailored ads for placement on these other Web sites, based upon a customer's shopping history and experience with us.
These companies also provide information to us, which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are.</p>
<p>For information about opt out programs that these third party advertising companies participate in, and the effect of opting out, click the following: [NAI Opt Out click here] and [DAA Opt Out - click here] (you'll then leave this site for centrally managed online sites where you may specify your preferences under those programs).

<strong>HOW MAY YOU INTERACT WITH THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES AND CONTENT?</strong>
</p>
<p>We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content.
We do this for your convenience.
We don't endorse, or generally have any affiliation with, these third parties.
And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices.
Whether their content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of those third-party sites govern your online experience (unless we have also linked our privacy policy and/or terms and conditions to some portion of the third-party site).
Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.</p>

This may include easy click-through access or even "single-sign on" to these sites.
The privacy policies of these third parties apply to the information collected by the third parties at these sites.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy, too, will apply at these sites if we display our content and feature our privacy policy there--but only to the extent that you directly provide us with your personal information, or we collect or observe this information through technology (as described above in Information We Observe or Collect through Technology).
In these cases, we may display or link our privacy policy and terms and conditions.
For example, you may find a third-party social media site (e.g., Facebook) where you can interact with us through a frame, e.g., you may virtually enter the frame to buy BBW products.
In this example, our displayed or linked privacy policy would apply to activities within that frame.
however, the third-party's privacy policy would apply otherwise.
Check all applicable policies when visiting such sites.</p>
<p>Note too, the social media sites where Bath &amp.
Body Works has a BBW social media page may provide aggregate information and analysis to us about visitors' use of these social media pages.
The analysis that is provided allows us to better understand and analyze our user growth, general demographic information about the users of our social media pages and interaction with content on our social media pages.</p>

Third-Party Rewards or Membership Programs</strong>
</p>
<p>We may interact with certain unrelated companies that offer their customers memberships to participate in programs, which may include rewards for purchases from us.
