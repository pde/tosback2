<strong>Privacy Policy (3040)</strong>
<p>At petco.com, we are concerned with protecting your privacy.
We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalized shopping experience.
We may also use it to tell you about special offers that we think you'd appreciate if you are subscribed to our newsletters.
You'll never have to worry about receiving a barrage of unexpected email from us if you have not subscribed with us.
We will not sell, rent or trade your information.</p>
<p>We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf.
They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data.
They are restricted from using this data for other purposes, and in any way other than to provide the requested services to petco.com, and may not alter or resell the data.
You may elect to opt-out of personally identifiable site tracking activity by following the Opt-out link below.
Keep in mind that petco.com may continue to collect anonymous aggregate site behavior from our customers.
Opt-out</p>
<p>We may occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures offer promotions on petco.com.
You have the option to specifically opt-in to participate in the promotion and share your personal data with these parties and petco.com.
These promotions may be in the form of a survey, contest or a separate area offering you the opportunity to enter your data for the specific purpose of participating in that program or promotion.
Data collected by these third-parties will be covered under the third-party's Privacy Policy agreement.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that petco.com, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, its affiliates, or any combination of such, could merge with, acquire, or be acquired by another business entity.
If such an action occurs, petco.com would like to let you know that some or all of the personal information collected about you would be shared with this entity in order to continue to provide reliable service.
Notice of such an event will be posted on this page, and we will require that all parties follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>When registering with petco.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and email address.
We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and some of our partners.
If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of pet you're interested in, for example.
We use this sort of information for editorial and personalization purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes (maybe we'll show cat owners a certain ad, for example) but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information.
This way we can give you customized information without compromising your privacy.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group.
For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in parrot behavior, based on online surveys or other requests.</p>
<p>We use a third party agent to handle our email marketing and you may refer to their privacy policy here.</p>
<p>If we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will collect a parent's permission offline (by postal mail, fax or phone) before we collect or share personal information with anyone else.</p>
<p>Please note that nowhere on the website do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from children under the age of 13.</p>
