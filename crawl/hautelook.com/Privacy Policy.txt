Please see the “Notices, Disclosures, and State-Specific Rights” section below for additional information.</p> Security and Fraud <p>We take steps to help protect the confidentiality and security of personal information you share with us through our website and mobile application.
In general, information transmitted through the Internet may not be perfectly secure, and we are unable to guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>

<p> You may come in contact with websites, emails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information with an offer such as a gift card.
HauteLook does not sponsor or endorse these offers.
If you become aware of any potentially fraudulent activity on a website or in an email or text, please forward the information to onlinefraud@nordstrom.com or call us at 1.888.282.6060 so that we can follow up.
You can also visit our Fraud Alerts page for additional information.
</p> Notices, Disclosures, and State-Specific Rights <ul>
<li>
<strong>Links to Other Websites and Services.</strong> Our website or mobile application may provide links to other Internet sites, content or videos (embedded or direct links) maintained by third parties.
We are not responsible for the sites, content, or videos accessed via the links, and we have not reviewed the privacy practices of those third parties.
We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Browser Do Not Track Signals.</strong> While we strive to offer you choices when you use our website and mobile application, we do not promise that we will be able to receive or honor web browser Do Not Track signals.
</li>
<li>
<strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong> California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties for third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Unless you request us to or consent to us doing so, HauteLook does not sell any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
If you have questions about these practices, please contact us at privacy@nordstrom.com.
California law also provides residents with rights to request access to and deletion of certain personal information, to know whether personal information is shared, and to opt out of the “sale” of personal information.
Some California laws also may define “personal information” differently from this Policy.
