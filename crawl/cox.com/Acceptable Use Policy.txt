provided, however, that in no event, shall this provision prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission or any state public service commission or public utility commission that has jurisdiction to hear such complaint, or any federal, state, or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against Cox on your behalf.
The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>20.2</strong> In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury, and review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.
Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.
You and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox.
Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.
Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, you and Cox may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court’s jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear your claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.3 Class Action Waiver:</strong> You and Cox agree that all claims or disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.
If you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.
Furthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or Cox from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general.
We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20 will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section 20.6 waiving the right to jury trial.
This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.4 Informal Dispute Resolution:</strong> You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.
If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify Cox of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Cox Customer Care, ATTN: Corporate Escalation Team, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319 so that Cox can attempt to resolve it with you.
If Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.
Neither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.5 Arbitration Procedures:</strong> You and Cox agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA").
The AAA’s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control.
To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319.
You must also comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration.
Cox will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of an arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this agreement or applicable law.
Cox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.
If you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox’s last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.
The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location.
If you seek less than $10,000, then you may chose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>20.6 Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, including without limitation, that the class waiver is found unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.7 Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 20.6 above) by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date of this Subscriber Agreement for current customers.
For new customers activating Service after the date of this Subscriber Agreement, you may opt out by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date you subscribe to the Service.
You may opt out through either of the following options (please include your name, address, and Cox account number on the communication): (1) sending a letter stating your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to Cox at Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319.
or (2) sending an email with your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com.
Exercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the other terms of this Agreement or other contracts with Cox and you may remain a Cox customer.
If you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, you will not be required to do so again if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.8 Survival:</strong> This dispute resolution provision survives the termination of your contract with Cox.
If you bring a claim against Cox after termination of your contract that is based in whole or in part on events or omissions that occurred while you were a Cox customer, this dispute resolution provision shall apply.</p>
<p>

<strong>Effective June 1, 2015 (revision number 22- replacing revision number 21 below)</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DO NOT INSTALL AND/OR ACTIVATE THE COX SERVICE.</strong>
</p>
<p>Subject to credit approval, Cox will provide all services that you, the Subscriber, request, on the following terms and conditions.
All Cox services are referred to as “Service” or “Services”.
If Cox provides telephone Service in your area, such Service will be provided through the Cox telephone affiliate servicing your area, and you will also be bound by that affiliate’s tariff on file with the State telephone regulatory authority and/or the service guides, Customer Service Agreement or other terms of service located on Cox’s website at http://www.cox.com/residential/phone/regulatory (“Phone Website”).
If you receive Cox’s High Speed Internet Service, you will also be bound by the Cox High Speed Internet Subscriber Agreement, and the Cox Acceptable Use Policy, both located at www.cox.com or at another URL Cox may designate (collectively with the Phone Website, the “Website”).
The Services are also subject to the Annual Customer Notice and the Annual Privacy Notice that you will receive each year and located on the Website. </p>
<p>A. Cox’s Obligations:<br>1. Install in a workmanlike manner, the necessary Cox Equipment and materials.
<br>2. Maintain Cox Equipment in accordance with reasonable industry standards and applicable regulations.
<br>3. If available, you may subscribe to the Cox wiring maintenance plan, and Cox will install and/or maintain wiring inside your premises (“Internal Wiring”).
Otherwise, Cox may have no responsibility for the maintenance of Your Internal Wiring.<br>4. Cox has no obligation or responsibility for loss of stored content on any devices or for any damage to your devices.</p>
<p>B. Your Obligations:<br>1. Charges and Payments.  Pay all installation, equipment, service or other charges by due date stated on your Cox bill.
Charges are according to Cox’s rate schedule or, for phone service, tariff or service guide applicable at the time Services are rendered.
Monthly service rates may be subject to additional federal, state and local fees, taxes, surcharges or other Cox imposed charges, including but not limited to, the regulatory cost recovery fee and the broadcast surcharge fee.  Fees and charges are payable in advance once service is initiated.
If you terminate Service before the end of a prepaid period, Cox will refund the prorated unused portion of the fees and charges.
If the pro-rata unused portion is less than $5.00, Cox will make the refund on your request.
If you or Cox terminate any of your Services, for any reason, and any outstanding balance is not paid in full by the due date, Cox may transfer such outstanding balances for Services provided under this Agreement to other accounts that you have with Cox.
<br>2. Failure to Pay.  If you fail to make timely payment, Cox may terminate Service, remove or disable Cox equipment and impose late fees, collection trip fees, if applicable.
Late fees and collection trip fees will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law.  <br>3. Safe Working Environment.  Provide Cox's employees and representatives with a safe working environment.
<br>4. Use of Services and Equipment.  You are liable for all Cox Equipment on your Premises and in your possession.
You agree to use the Cox Equipment only for receiving the Services.
For example, you will use any modem embedded in a digital video receiver only for the receipt of Cox video Services and any other Services expressly authorized by Cox.
You agree that you will not and you will not permit others, including without limitation any other provider of video, telecommunications or Internet services, to use, rearrange, disconnect, abandon, remove, relocate, repair, alter, tamper or otherwise interfere with any of the Cox Equipment including software or firmware without Cox’s prior written consent, which Cox may withhold in its sole discretion.
Such prohibition includes attaching or, permitting others to attach any unauthorized devices to Cox Equipment, using or permitting others to use equipment that causes interference with reception equipment, or otherwise degrades Cox’s cable network signal quality or strength or creates signal leakage, altering a cable modem to change its downloading or uploading capacity, or altering identifying information such as serial numbers or logos.
You assume complete responsibility for improper use, damage or loss of any equipment or software/firmware furnished by Cox.
You shall only use the Cox Equipment and Services in accordance with these terms and conditions and such other instructions, guidelines or procedures provided to you by Cox and in a manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
If you use the Services or Cox equipment in a manner that violates any of those materials, or applicable laws and regulations, then Cox shall have the right to immediately restrict, suspend, or terminate your Services, without liability on the part of Cox.
<br>5. Access to Premises.  Allow Cox access into your premises to install, maintain or repair, upgrade (if any), and remove Cox Equipment.
Cox personnel have Cox identification you may request and examine.
If you are not home at the time of a service call, you may authorize any other adult resident or guest at your residence to grant Cox access to your premises.
<br>6. No Assignment or Transfer.  Any attempted assignment or transfer of the Services to any other tenant or occupant or to any other location without Cox’s prior written consent is prohibited and is a breach of this Agreement.
<br>7. Authorization.  If you do not own your premises: (i) You represent that you have obtained necessary permission from the owner to install Cox’s Equipment (including, without limitation, equipment attached to the outside of the premises).
and (ii) You will indemnify Cox from all claims of the owner in connection with the installation and provision of the Services.
<br>8. Phone Equipment and Back-Up Battery.  A telephone modem is required and will be provided for duration of phone service subscription.
Upon disconnection of phone service, modem must be returned within 30 days or a monthly rental fee or lost equipment charge will apply.
Modem uses household electrical power to operate.
Telephone service, including access to e911 service, will not be available during a power outage without a backup battery or if the modem is moved or inoperable.
If you have a home alarm system or home health monitoring system that relies on your telephone line to operate, you will lose access to the service during a power outage unless you have a backup battery.
You may purchase a backup battery from Cox so your telephone Service will continue to operate for up to eight hours during a power outage or, if you are a Lifeline customer, obtain a battery from Cox without charge.
If Cox does not provide a modem for Cox Services utilizing a telephone cable modem, you must provide it and it will remain your responsibility in all respects, including obtaining battery backup.
If (i) the modem that supplies your telephone Service is disconnected or moved, (ii) the backup battery is not charged or otherwise becomes inoperable, or (iii) there is an extended power outage, telephone Service, including access to e911, will not be available.
It is your responsibility to monitor the health of the battery and obtain a replacement (see www.cox.com/battery) if the battery is reaching the end of its useful life.
Cox uses your telephone Service address to identify your location for e911 Service.
To ensure that e911 dispatch receives your correct address, the telephone modem should not be moved, even inside your home.
You must notify Cox in advance if you would like to move or relocate your telephone Service.</p>
<p>C. Cox Equipment: In connection with the Services, Cox or its agent may provide you with equipment and embedded software including video equipment, Internet equipment, and equipment for telephone service, software or firmware, with or without a separate charge or rental fee (“Cox Equipment”).
You may purchase some equipment at retail or from Cox directly that may perform some or all of the functions of Cox Equipment (with the exception of Cable Cards®).
Cox Equipment, with the exception of a backup battery you purchase for telephone service, will remain the property of Cox and you will not acquire any ownership or other interest in Cox Equipment or any network facilities, cabling or software by virtue of any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or by any attachment of the Cox Equipment to the Premises.
Cox shall have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to upgrade, replace, remove or otherwise change the Cox Equipment (including embedded software).
You consent to such changes including code updates or downloads with or without notice to you which may alter, add to, or remove features or functionalities of the Cox Equipment.
Cox may, at its option, install new or reconditioned Cox Equipment, including replacing your existing Cox Equipment, for which you may incur a fee.
You agree that such changes may be performed within Cox’s sole discretion at any time and in any manner.
It is a material breach for you to copy, duplicate, reverse engineer or in any way tamper with or interfere with any Software provided to you by Cox.
You also agree:   <br>1. To use the Cox Equipment only for receiving Services ordered from or through Cox.
You will only use any modem embedded in a digital video device (e.g.
set top box, DTA, etc.) for the receipt of Cox video Services.
<br>2. To promptly return the Cox Equipment, in person, to any Cox retail center or your local Cox office within thirty (30) days of notifying Cox of your decision to terminate your Service, unless otherwise instructed in writing by a Cox representative, in good condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use.
If you do not promptly return the Cox Equipment or if it is damaged or encumbered, (“Unreturned Equipment”), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, you agree to pay, and Cox may charge your account, a liquidated damages amount equal to Cox’s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs.
provided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law (the “Unreturned Equipment Charge”).
If you downgrade your Services, you must promptly return and exchange any advanced Cox Equipment (e.g.
HD or DVR receiver, phone/data modem), in person, to any Cox retail center or your local Cox office within thirty (30) days of notifying Cox of your decision to downgrade your Service, unless otherwise instructed in writing by a Cox representative, in good condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use, for standard Cox Equipment (e.g.
standard digital receiver, basic phone modem, etc.).  Otherwise, advanced Equipment charges may continue to apply.
This provision and any other provision that by its nature should survive shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>D. Programming: You acknowledge that Cox reserves the right at any time and in its sole discretion to change its channel lineup and/or to pre-empt specific programs or parts of programs previously advertised as available.
Cox also reserves the right to alter its fee structure upon notice to you.
You may immediately terminate service upon notice to Cox.
You may not rebroadcast, transmit, record, perform, or charge admission to view or listen to any of the programming made available by the Services unless you obtain and pay for any public performance licenses.</p>
<p>E. LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY: COX, ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, (COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY, THE “COX GROUP”) MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO THE EQUIPMENT FURNISHED TO YOU AND/OR SERVICES PROVIDED.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THESE PROVISIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
THE COX GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH, OR THE DEGRADATION OR INTERRUPTION OF ANY SERVICES, FOR ANY LOST DATA OR CONTENT, IDENTITY THEFT, FOR ANY FILES OR SOFTWARE DAMAGE, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE.
THE COX GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR FOR INJURY TO ANY PERSON ARISING FROM THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE OR REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, WIRING OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES.
NOR SHALL COX BE LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICE IF THE CAUSE IS DUE TO THE ACTS OF A THIRD PARTY.</p>
<p>YOU HEREBY INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COX GROUP FROM ANY CLAIMS, ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, DAMAGES AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES, ARISING OUT OF (I) SUCH DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM ANY CLAIM THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE INFRINGES ON THE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, (II) ANY BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH BY YOU OF THIS AGREEMENT.
OR INJURY TO PERSON OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM YOUR NEGLIGENCE.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE COX GROUP BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
THE COX GROUP’S MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING YOUR CLAIM.</p>
<p>F. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION (EXCEPT JURY TRIAL WAIVER) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS AGREEMENT, IF YOU FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION F(2) BELOW.
OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE BOUND TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH COX THROUGH THE FOLLOWING DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES.</p>
<p>1. YOU AND COX AGREE TO ARBITRATE — RATHER THAN LITIGATE IN COURT — any and all claims or disputes between us (including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of Cox) that arise out of or in any way relate to this Agreement or any Services or products that Cox provides to you in connection with this Agreement (including but not limited to amounts that Cox charges you for Services or products provided).  You and Cox also agree to arbitrate any and all claims or disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to any services or products provided to you by Cox or any of its affiliated entities under any other agreement.  Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you and Cox may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court's jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear the claims.</p>
<p>2. Opt Out:  You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section F(7) below) by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of receipt of this Agreement by sending a letter stating that you are opting out of this dispute resolution provision to Cox at ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com or via U.S.
mail to Cox Communications Legal Department, Attn:  Litigation Counsel, 6205-B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30328.  Exercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the terms of your contract with Cox, and you may remain a Cox customer.  If you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, that opt out will remain in effect if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service under this Agreement.  If you enter into a new agreement with Cox that includes a dispute resolution provision and you want to opt out of that provision, you will need to follow the instructions in that agreement for opting out.</p>
<p>3. Class Action Waiver: You and Cox agree that all claims or disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.  If you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.
Furthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox.
We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section F will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section F(7) waiving the right to jury trial.
This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>4. Arbitrator Authority: The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding.  In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury.  Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.
You and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
An arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox.  Review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.</p>
<p>5. Informal Dispute Resolution: You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.
If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify Cox of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Cox Customer Care, ATTN: Corporate Escalation Team, 6205-B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30328 so that Cox can attempt to resolve it with you.  If Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.  Neither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p>6. Arbitration Procedures: You and Cox agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  The AAA's rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.  If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control.
To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox at ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com or via U.S.
mail to Cox Communications Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205-B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA, 30328.
You must also comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration.
Cox will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this agreement or applicable law.
Cox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration, even if allowed under the law, unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.
If you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox's last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.  The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location.</p>
<p>7. Jury Trial Waiver: If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>
<p>8. Survival: This dispute resolution provision survives the termination of your contract with Cox.
If you bring a claim against Cox after termination of your contract that is based in whole or in part on events or omissions that occurred while you were a Cox customer, this dispute resolution provision shall apply.</p>
<p>9. Order of Precedence.  Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained herein, if you are required to arbitrate any claim or dispute that arises out of or relate in any way to any Services provided to you by Cox or any of its affiliated entities under any other agreement with Cox prior to the effective date of this Agreement (“Prior Agreement”), the dispute resolution terms contained in the Prior Agreement shall control with respect to those Services.  Otherwise, the dispute resolution terms contained in this Agreement shall control. </p>
<p>G. Notices of Changes.  Cox will provide you with written notice of any changes that we determine are material to this Agreement, including all notices required by applicable law or tariff.  We may provide you with such written notice by sending it to your last known billing address, by including the notice in your bill statement, by sending you an electronic communication to any email address, wireless or landline number, or such other destination or device you provided to Cox, or by any other lawful means.  All such changes will become effective as of the date specified on the written notice.  Except as may otherwise be provided herein, the updated version of this Agreement will supersede any prior versions of the same agreements.  Your continued use of the Service(s) after notice of any changes will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified.</p>
<p>H. Breach of Agreement: If you breach this Agreement, or any other agreement referenced herein, Cox has the right to terminate this Agreement and retrieve its equipment.
Cox’s failure to require your strict performance of any term of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of Cox’s right to require strict performance of any term or condition herein.</p>
<p>I. Entire Agreement: This Agreement, any applicable tariffs and other agreements specifically referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between Cox and You for the subject matter hereof.
Only Cox may make modifications to this document.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any term of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.</p>

<li>If You do not own Your premises: (i) You represent that You have obtained necessary permission from the owner to install Cox’s equipment (including, without limitation, equipment attached to the outside of the premises).
and (ii) You will indemnify Cox from all claims of the owner in connection with the installation and provision of the Services.
</li>
<li>Cox may provide a modem with backup battery power for telephone service that requires a telephone cable modem to receive telephone service.
That modem will remain the property of Cox and must be returned upon disconnection of Service.
In the event of a power outage, your telephone Service will continue to operate for up to eight hours with the backup battery that Cox provides.
If Cox does not provide a modem or backup battery power for Cox Services utilizing a telephone cable modem, you must provide it and it will remain your responsibility in all respects.
If (i) the modem that supplies your telephone Service is disconnected or moved, (ii) the backup battery is not charged or otherwise becomes inoperable, or (iii) there is an extended power outage, telephone Service, including access to E911, will not be available.
Cox uses your telephone Service address to identify your location for E911 Service.
To ensure that E911 dispatch receives your correct address, the telephone modem should not be moved, even inside your home.
You must notify Cox in advance if you would like to move or relocate your telephone Service.</li>

<p>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> All Cox Equipment and embedded Software (Equipment) provided to You by Cox or its agent will remain the property of Cox.
Cox shall have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to install or modify the software in any of the Equipment.
It is a material breach for You to copy, duplicate, reverse engineer or in any way tamper with or interfere with any Software provided to You by Cox.
You also agree:</p>
<ol>
<li>To use the Equipment only for receiving Services ordered from or through Cox.
You will only use any modem embedded in a digital video box for the receipt of Cox video Services.
</li>
<li>To promptly return the Equipment to Cox in good condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use, immediately upon discontinuance of Service.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If You do not promptly return the Equipment or if it is damaged or encumbered, (“Unreturned Equipment”), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, You agree to pay, and Cox may charge Your account, a liquidated damages amount equal to Cox’s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs.
provided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law (the “Unreturned Equipment Charge”).
This provision and any other provision that by its nature should survive shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Programming:</strong> You acknowledge that Cox reserves the right at any time and in its sole discretion to change its channel lineup and/or to pre-empt specific programs or parts of programs previously advertised as available.
Cox also reserves the right to alter its fee structure upon notice to You.
You may immediately terminate service upon notice to Cox.
You may not rebroadcast, transmit, record, perform, or charge admission to view or listen to any of the programming made available by the Services unless you obtain and pay for any public performance licenses.</p>
