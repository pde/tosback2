<p>The order reads: “If your vehicle’s license plate ends in a letter (A,B,C…), you are only permitted to fuel the vehicle on odd-numbered days.” Numbers are allowed on even-numbered days.</p>
<p>The problem: All license plates in New Jersey end in letters, except for vanity plates.
So on Saturday, most everyone in the state could buy gas.
On Sunday, no one can.
Or so it seems.</p>
</blockquote> — <em>The New York Times</em> points out the pure stupidity of New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s order regarding gas rationing.

</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating parts of post-Sandy life has been the unendingly long lines for gas.
Two arrests for violence at gas stations were made in Staten Island yesterday, and Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano announced yesterday that gas rations would come into effect today, limiting gas sales to ten gallons per driver.</p>
<p>Enter our anonymous tipster who tells us that a “a certain blonde haired blow-hard who has an obsession with our current president” is using Yonkers gas to fill up a number of passenger vans for his reality show. </p>

<li> Nov 3, 2012 3:04pm Tweet Romney’s New Attack Dog, Rudy Giuliani, Calls For Obama’s Resignation <p>
</p>
<p>Even though he’s being attacked by idiots, Nate Silver is calling the election a complete lock for Obama which basically means it’s over.
So what’s Mitt Romney to do now? Unless all of the state polls are totally off, he’s going to be out of a job come next week.
He needs one last trump card and the Donald isn’t the man for the job.
Romney is now hedging his bets on a last minute performance from Rudy Giuliani.</p>
<p>The former New York mayor joined Romney and Paul Ryan onstage at a mega-rally in Ohio last night, as part of a Republican all-star lineup that also included former presidential candidates John McCain, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry.</p>
<p>Giuliani made the most news of the night by calling for Obama’s resignation.</p>

<p>The shirts are $20 and all funds raised by sales go to Sandy relief efforts.</p>

</p>
<p>Everyone who has some free time this weekend should spend their hours volunteering.
But after you do your great deeds, like donating food or clothes, you might be tempted to overshare about it.
You will immediately want to run to the hilltops and scream, “Hey everybody, look how much good I did.” Don’t do this! You will lose all of the moral superiority that you just earned.</p>
<p>Below are some suggestions that will help you to not act like a stupid jerk who brags about how much they volunteer.</p>

<li> Nov 3, 2012 11:09am Tweet Live Nation Gave Lady Gaga a Plane and Proscuitto Last Night <p>
</p>
<p>Lady Gaga’s Monster Ball Tour grossed 227.4 million dollars, so it’s expected that the touring industry wants to keep her happy.
Live Nation wanted to make sure the Gags was at peak happiness so they gave her a 757 jet.
She told her 30.8 million Twitter followers last night “So apparently LIVE NATION gave us a 757 I just cried on the tarmac.
We tried to take a pic but its too big.” That last part is such a humble-brag.</p>
<p>She followed up that tweet with, “OMG there’s Internet on the PLANE.
THIS IS MY PLANE IT HAS INTERWEBULAR features.
Monsters :( i cant believe this sometimes,” which confirms the fact that Lady Gaga has never flown select flights on Delta Airlines before this.</p>

<li> Nov 3, 2012 10:30am Tweet <p>This is a video of Christina Aguilera performing “Beautiful” from last night’s Sandy benefit concert on NBC.
(Note: text “redcross” to 90999 if you want to donate).
Billy Joel also performed “Miami 2017” and changed the lyrics to say that “Staten Island drowned,” which gave everyone the shivers.
Jimmy Fallon sang with Billy Joel, Sting, and Bon Jovi and smiled a lot.</p>
<p>But if you’ve ever had any doubts that Christina is the diva of our generation, then this video should squash those wrongful beliefs. </p>

<p>Two reporters/practical joke columnists (really) who worked for a Kyrgyzstan paper decided to step up their joke game in a normal, reasonable way, which was: by kidnapping the host of an popular entertainment show at gun point and forcing her to strip and dance for them.</p>

<li> Nov 2, 2012 8:19pm Tweet John Cusack Developing Film About America’s Most Popular Misogynist, Rush Limbaugh <p>
</p>
<p>Active Twitter liberal John Cusack is developing a film about Rush Limbaugh, tentatively and creatively titled “Rush.” And, of course, the former Lloyd Dobler will play the popular conservative radio host/misogynistic racist himself.
As the Associated Press notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cusack as Limbaugh isn’t typecasting, politics aside.
Cusack is a slender, dark-haired 46-year-old, while Limbaugh is 61, balding and portly.
But Hollywood’s makeup experts have probably had greater challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha, yes.
All of that is true, AP.
Also, this movie will almost certainly be awful.
Production starts next year, which means it should be ready for hungover Saturday morning viewing on Netflix sometime in early 2014.</p>

Thanks to those readers who enjoyed this old-school exhibition.
And thanks to the writers for being patient. </p>
