Wolfram|Alpha Privacy Policy <p>We understand your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly.
This page explains how the information you provide is collected and used.</p> What Information Do We Collect? <p>We may collect both personally identifiable information about you and non-personally-identifiable information about your experience when you access the Wolfram|Alpha website.</p>
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect on our website or through our service consists of information you submit to us, including your name, email address, and other personal information that you willingly provide.
Because participation in these activities is voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.</p>
<p>In addition to information that you provide to us through forms, we receive non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with our websites, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, geographical region, referral URLs, and other data automatically supplied by common web browsers.</p> What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites? <p>When you use any Wolfram|Alpha application associated with a Third-Party Site ("TPS"), including but not limited to social networking sites such as Facebook, we may collect personally identifiable information about you from the profile you have established at the TPS.</p>
<p>By authorizing Wolfram|Alpha to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing Wolfram|Alpha to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow Wolfram|Alpha to access through the TPS Application Programming Interface ("API").</p>
<p>The personally identifiable information Wolfram|Alpha is allowed to access is affected by the privacy settings you have established at the TPS.
Because the linkage between any TPS and Wolfram|Alpha is completely voluntary, and our ability to access your information at the TPS requires that linkage, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.</p> How Is Your Information Used? <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
We do not sell, rent, or lease your information to third parties.</p>

Non-personal information collected about you through your experience and queries is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our website and how we might improve our services to improve the collective experience.

When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications to respond to you and improve our products and services.</p>
<p>Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects such things as your results' default currency and units of measure, based on what country you are in.
Your browser type may be used to fine-tune the results for optimal display, for example on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser.
Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.</p> Other Disclosures of Your Information <p>We may release personally identifying information when we believe release is necessary to comply with lawful court orders.
Any collected information associated with your use of the website (personal and non-personal) will be disclosed to government authorities or third parties only pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena, or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.</p>
