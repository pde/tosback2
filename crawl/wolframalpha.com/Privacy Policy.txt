</ul> LEGAL INFORMATION Wolfram Privacy Policy <p> Wolfram understands your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly.
This policy explains how the information you provide is collected and used.
</p> What Information Do We Collect? <p> We may collect both personally identifiable information about you and non-personally-identifiable information through your experience on our websites, from your use of our services and products, and via other voluntary contact with you (collectively "Services").
</p>
<p> The personally identifiable information we collect through our Services primarily consists of information you submit to us, including your name, email address and other personal information that you willingly provide.
Because participation in our Services is voluntary, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.
</p>
<p> In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we receive some additional personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information whenever you interact with our Services online, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, referral URLs and other data automatically supplied by most common web browsers.
</p>
<p> We may also collect information from third-party sites, as described below in What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites? </p> How Is Your Information Used? <p> The information we obtain from users, site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our Services.
Non-personal information collected about you through your experience, queries and feedback is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our Services and how we might improve the collective experience.
Except as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access our Services for internal reporting, diagnostic analysis and security purposes only.
</p>
<p> Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects the computations or outputs provided by our Services for such things as default currency and units of measure based on what country you are in.
Your browser type may be used to optimize your display, for example on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser.
Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.
</p>
<p> If you provide your email address to us, we may email you in response, as well as notify you of other offers or services that may be of interest.
When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain that communication to respond to you and improve our Services.
If at any time you want to stop receiving communication from us, please click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email message from us, or contact our customer service online or by phone at 1-800-WOLFRAM.
However, please note that we may still contact you with transactional communications associated with any software or service agreements you have with us or in direct response to any communication you send us.
</p> Disclosures of Your Information <p> We do not sell, rent, trade or lease your information to third parties.
Any information we share shall be subject to the parameters associated with your requested Services and preferences.
</p>
<p> When we share personal information, we require the recipient to protect your personal information in compliance with the law.
Wolfram may share information with affiliates, partners, service providers, authorized resellers and distributors and relevant third parties in order to fulfill the limited purposes described herein.
</p>
<p> Any collected information (personal and non-personal) associated with your use of our Services may also be subject to disclosure to government authorities or other authorized third parties pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.
</p>
<p> We may also preserve, use or disclose your information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and related agreements.
to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, including suspiciously high-volume use of our Services.
to respond to support requests.
or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others.
</p> What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites? <p> When you use our Services to connect to or access data from a third-party site ("TPS"), including but not limited to social networking sites, we may collect personally identifiable information about you from any TPS profile for which you give our Services access credentials.
</p>
<p> By authorizing these Services to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, to collect, store and use any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow our Services to access through the TPS application programming interface ("API").
</p>
<p> Because the linkage between any TPS and our Services is completely voluntary and our Services' abilities to access your information at the TPS require that linkage, and any information transmitted is controlled by your privacy settings at the TPS, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.
</p> Links to Third-Party Websites <p> From time to time, our Services may contain links to other websites.
We do not exercise any control over these websites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content.
We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when following links from our Services.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Services.
</p> Cookies <p> When you visit our websites, they, like most websites, send one or more cookies—small identifiers—to your computer that store information about your session and preferences as well as information that can help improve our Services.
While we do use strictly necessary and functional cookies for basic site functionality, as well as security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose in using all other cookies is to enhance and improve your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends.
We utilize the following types of cookies: </p>
<ul>
<li> Default cookies: These strictly necessary and functional cookies support and facilitate the provision of services that you have requested on our websites, and may enable enhanced features.
</li>
<li> Additional cookies: These cookies collect information that we utilize to support the measurement of our websites.
On specific sites, Wolfram may use third-party cookies when working with outside partners for analytics and to optimize delivery of information that may be of interest to you.
We do not have access to read or write such third-party cookies, nor do we directly control the manner in which they may be used.
</li>
</ul>
<p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but can typically be configured to block all cookies or block all third-party cookies.
Please be aware that our websites may not have full functionality for you if your browser is set to block some or all cookies.
Depending on your location, you may also be prompted to provide your consent to all cookies, other than strictly necessary and functional cookies, each time you visit our websites.
Any information about you collected by us is retained and protected in accordance with the laws governing your location.
</p> Security <p> We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our Services.
These include precautions to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
</p>
<p> Despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet may be intercepted.
Your use of our Services constitutes an acceptance of such risk.
</p> Accessing Our Data Servers <p> Various Wolfram Services offer some functionality for which they must access our data servers through the internet.
When they do so, our data servers receive information similar to what our web servers receive when you visit our websites, as well as various Service-specific identifying information.
</p>
<p> Specifically, using Wolfram|Alpha, or utilizing the Wolfram|Alpha functionality within other Services, will trigger the collection of information about the specific query.
Some queries may require collecting additional information, such as session information covering the history of Wolfram Mathematica evaluations or the content of Wolfram Finance Platform notebooks containing the Wolfram|Alpha query.
</p> You can choose to prevent these Services from accessing our servers by disconnecting from the internet or by using the Internet Connectivity item in the Help menu to tell the Service not to connect to the internet.
If you choose not to allow these Services to access our servers, our Services will not be able to perform certain functions.
<p> Under normal circumstances, we will never release information on accesses to our servers.
We may, however, release information as described above in Disclosures of Your Information.
</p> Accessing Our Services from Third-Party Sources <p>
<em>This section is only applicable to Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Cloud:</em>
</p>
<p> These Services may additionally be accessed through web widgets, scripts or gadgets that are embedded on third-party sites.
If you choose to access these Services via such tools, then depending on the third-party technology, your personal information and input may be passed on to the third party's servers prior to being processed by our Services.
</p> Data Retention and the GDPR <p> We collect and hold personal data about our customers, users and enthusiasts, employees and others in the European Union who access our resources and services in a manner consistent with the lawful bases as outlined in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Please see the Data Retention Policy Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies, which outlines our GDPR compliance in collecting, processing and using your personal data.
It also describes how you can contact us to review any personal data and withdraw any consent you have given us to store it.
</p> Changes to This Privacy Policy <p> We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future.
Any such updates or modifications shall be effective immediately upon their announcement.
Please refer often to this document online for the latest information.
</p> Questions, Concerns and More Information <p> For information on policies related to the use of our Services, see our Legal portal.
</p>
<p> If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us online or by US mail at Wolfram, Attn: Legal Department, 100 Trade Center Drive, Champaign, IL 61820-7237 USA.
</p>
<p> By using our Services, you are telling us either that you are 18 years or older and legally able to form contracts, or that an adult with authority to act on your behalf has agreed to these terms and to be responsible for ensuring your compliance with them in your use of the Services and any results you obtain from them.
If you don't want to be bound by these terms, do not use the Services or their results.
