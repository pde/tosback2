<br>
This Privacy Policy is principally intended to address the information collected from you at the Site, but we describe in certain places how we collect or use information in other ways, as well, such as if you contact our customer service and/or ordering departments by mail or telephone).<br>

In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Financial Privacy Notice, the terms of the Financial Privacy Notice will prevail.<br>
<br>
<strong>1.         The Information We Collect and How We May Use It</strong>
<br>
We collect information from you in three ways:  first, we collect certain information directly from you, such as when you submit it to us or the Site.
second, we collect information automatically, or passively, when you interact with the Site.
third, we sometimes receive information from third parties.
  <br>
<strong>
<em>a.         Information We Collect Directly From You</em>
</strong>
<br>
We collect certain information directly from you, including when you make purchases or require delivery, when you establish an account with us, register to use certain features of our Site, or you otherwise communicate with us: </p>
<ul>
<li>In ress, telephone number, and information related to the above. </li>
<li>Worder to make purchases, to access certain information, features or services at the Site or offerings of The Swiss Colony, you may be required to provide certain information that identifies you as an individual, including your name, address, email adde collect your credit card information and other payment details, when required to complete a transaction.</li>
<li>If you use our credit plan or submit a credit application, we may collect other financial and personal information from and about you.</li>
<li>If you provide comments or suggestions to us, we will keep those, and if you contact our customer service or other departments, we will maintain those communications and your contact details.</li>
<li>We sometimes collect information from you through surveys, promotions, sweepstakes and contests, or other outreach programs.  Likewise, if you sign up for our wish list service, we will ask you for information concerning your gift selections.</li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed below, we also may sometimes obtain personal information from data providers who provide us information about our own customers or prospective customers.
  We also sometimes collect information from our customers (or others) when we communicate with them in phone calls, emails, or other “offline” settings. <br>
<br>
<strong>
<em>b.        Information We Collect Passively </em>
</strong>
<br>
We also collect information by automated means -- cookies, web beacons and similar technologies -- when you visit our Site, interact with our ads on other websites, or open an email that we send.  Cookies are small files that contain a short line of text that can identify and track a browser’s movements.
 A web beacon, also known as a web pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies, and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.</p>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons on our Site to identify you as you move from page to page and to collect information to keep track of your visit (or your email “opens”).
 For example, cookies allow us to know what item(s) you have placed in your shopping cart, and to track that information for checkout even if you decide to leave the Site and return at a later time to finish shopping.  When aggregated, this type of information helps us to understand and adjust to the needs and desires of our Site visitors.
 <br>
<br>
The information we collect and maintain through cookies and web beacons includes your IP address, browser type and other browser characteristics, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Site (such as what pages you view, and what links you click on), and dates and times of Site visits.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we work with third party advertising platforms who place cookies on our Site and in online ads (or emails), in order to track web visitors and help us tailor and analyze ad performance.  These advertising platforms may collect and use similar information on other websites.
 For instance, if you tend to view recipe websites, these providers might serve an ad for us or another company that sells gourmet food products.
  To learn how to “opt out” of interest-based advertising by these types of companies, using these technologies, please go to Section 4 below.
  Note that if you block all cookies through your browser preferences, our Site and many other sites will likely not function as intended, and key functionality of this and other websites may be lost.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>c.         Information We Receive From Third Parties.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We share information with and/or receive information from Our Family of Companies.  For instance, if we believe that you would be interested in receiving offers or discounts from one of our affiliated companies, we might share your contact information with that affiliate.</li>
<li>Similarly, we sometimes receive information (such as contact information, or interest data connected to a person’s contact information) from third parties with whom we have marketing, advertising or service relationships.  Sometimes, we use these companies to enhance Information we already have (such as regarding your demographics or likely interests).
 (We provide information about how to “opt out” of third party data sharing in Section 4, below.)</li>
<li>We also may collect information from consumer reporting agencies, as appropriate and/or required under law.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we use the term “Information” above and below, to describe how we use and share data, that refers collectively (and individually) to any of the information that we collect, as described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
<strong>2.         How We Use The Information We Collect and Receive</strong>
<br>
Generally, we use the Information we collect and receive to operate our Site and provide products, services and information (including marketing) to our customers and prospective customers.

<p>We use service providers to perform tasks for us (as described in Section 3), such as providing marketing assistance and data analysis.
and we may provide personal information to those businesses.
 Please go to Section 3 regarding “How We Share the Information” for more information about the types of third parties that may receive the Information. <br>
<br>
<strong>3.         How and Why We Share the Information</strong>
<br>
The reasons we share the Information are as follows:<br>
a.         <em>Service Providers, Generally.
</em> We share Information with numerous service providers in order to maintain our Site and provide our products to customers and prospective customers. <br>
b.         <em>Service Providers Used to Provide Products.  </em>For instance, in order to offer and deliver (and receive payment for) our products, we share Information (including personal contact information) with third parties that provide services pertaining to billing, collection, credit extension, credit card and account processing, customer and technical support, web and server hosting, shipping and order fulfillment.<br>
c.         <em>Marketing Service Providers.  </em>In order to effectively market our products, we share Information with third parties that provide services pertaining to marketing (including email, display and direct mail marketing), data enhancement, email delivery, printing, data and marketing analytics, and campaign creation and analytics.<br>
d.         <em>Online Service Providers.  </em>We share web and mobile Information (including unique identifiers) with various online third party advertising and analytics platforms, as further described in Section 4.<br>
e.         <em>Use by Affiliates.
</em> As noted above, we share Information with and/or receive information from Our Family of Companies.  For instance, if we believe that you would be interested in receiving offers or discounts from one of our affiliated companies, we might share your contact information with that affiliate.<br>
f.         <em>Use by Marketers and Co-Marketers.  </em>We also sometimes make certain Information available to other marketers to help them tailor more relevant offers, coupons and advertising to potential consumers.  These marketers may be “co-marketers” that advertise their products alongside ours.
or, they may be non-affiliated marketing organizations who we have banded with cooperatively in order to mutually enhance the way we target customers and prospective customers.   If you wish to opt out of this type of data sharing, please go to Section 4 to learn how.  <br>
g.         <em>Disclosure for Legal Process.</em>  We may share any Information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial or administrative proceeding, court or governmental order, or legal process served on Us.
We also may share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to The Swiss Colony, Our Family of Companies, the Site, our customers, or any other person or entity.
This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.<br>
h.         <em>Corporate Asset Transactions.</em>  We may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets.  In such transactions, any Information we hold may be among the transferred assets, and may be shared during due diligence leading up to any transfer. <br>
i<em>.          Consent.</em>  We may share Information about you in any other circumstances where we have your consent or in order to provide a requested service.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.         Interest-Based Advertising and Your Marketing and Advertising Choices</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>a.         Interest Based Advertising.</em>  We work with third party advertising platforms to place advertising, which may be through display, email, direct mail, or other methods.  These third party platforms use technologies like cookies and web pixels that we describe in Section 1(b).  These platforms may use these technologies to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Site and other sites (or other information about you), (ii) serve ads on other sites, (iii) report how our advertising performs (for instance, whether advertising impressions may be related to visits to our Site other transactions or activities), or (iv) analyze website visits or ad campaigns in other ways.
 This type of advertising – <em>i.e.</em>, using behaviors over time and across sites to serve more relevant ads – is often called “interest based advertising.”</p>
<p>Similarly, when we work with these ad platforms, we or they may place cookies (or similar technologies) that have been associated with de-identified (such as through a “hashing” formula) demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) and that we may share with a service provider to trigger or suppress an ad.  Through these and other identifiers (which are de-identified but may have been derived from your contact information), service providers we work with may target, measure, or analyze advertising to you on a variety of other platforms (for our products or other products), such as through direct mail, email, or “connected” television channels, as well as social media platforms.</p>
<p>
<em>b.         Cross-Channel and Cross-Device Marketing:  </em> In order to provide more relevant marketing (and often, to offer discounts on our products), we engage in “cross-channel” and “cross-device” marketing, and work with third party providers that assist us with this marketing.  This means that Information that we (or they) collect through one device or method of marketing may be associated with other information to allow us (or in some cases, an affiliate of ours) to market to you through another device or marketing method.  For instance, if you visit or purchase products through our Site, we may use information such as your email or IP address (or other Information we receive) to send offers to a mobile device that we think you are also using.  Or, if you visit or log-in to our Site, we may associate Information we collect with other personal or de-identified information in order to send you a “direct mail” flyer or coupon – for example, to provide a discount to you for a product that you’ve expressed interest in, or a similar type of product.  We describe your “opt out” options below.</p>
<p>
<em>c.         Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising.</em>  If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver interest-based advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link  and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link and on those sites, you may opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that help serve those ads.
We also may use technologies, such as our cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.
To opt out of our cookies used for this online advertising, click here.
Opting out in this way won’t prevent you from receiving ads – it will only (in many cases) make those ads less relevant, because they won’t be tailored to your interests.  Also note that the above opt-outs are cookie-based, so if you delete your cookies (or change your browser), you’ll need to opt out again.
 We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>
<em>d.         Mobile Advertising Choices.</em>  We may sometimes serve ads through mobile apps, and these may be “interest-based” as well.
 Each operating system (<em>e.g.,</em> iOS and Android) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of interest-based ads.
To learn more about this, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.</p>
<p>
<em>e.         Your Choices Regarding Promotional Catalogs.  </em>If you no longer wish to receive our promotional catalogs, you may call us at @CustServPhone to make arrangements for those mailings to be discontinued.
 As a member of the Direct Marketing Association, we comply with its requirements for consumer choice, including its Commitment to Consumer Choice and DMAchoice programs, and honor opt-outs from marketing communications through those programs.
You can find more information about the DMA and its Commitment to Consumer Choice at: <strong>www.the-dma.org</strong>; <strong>www.dmaccc.org</strong>.
and <strong>www.dmachoice.org</strong>.
Please understand that it may take several weeks for requested changes through these procedures to take effect and for such mailings to be discontinued.<br>
<br>
<strong>7.         California’s “Shine the Light” Law:  Opting Out of Sharing for Direct Marketing</strong>
</p> Your California Privacy Rights.
 Notice to California Customers <p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business's disclosures of personal information to third parties for third party direct marketing purposes.
Alternately, a business may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers for third party direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.
(Note: our sites, like most in the U.S., do not recognize the "do not track signals" that some browsers may employ.)  As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes offline please by calling us at 800-913-0743, emailing us at CAPrivacy@swisscolony.com or writing us at Customer Service, 1112 7th Avenue, Monroe, WI 53566.</p>
<p>An opt out with respect to third party sharing will not apply to information-sharing arrangements needed to process and fulfill product orders, or as otherwise described in our <strong>Financial Privacy Notice</strong>. "Click here" to see our <strong>Financial Privacy Notice</strong>.<br>
