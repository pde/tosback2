<strong>Advertising Companies</strong>.
We also use Third Party advertising companies to assist Us with our online advertising.
These advertising companies use cookies and other Web Technologies to target and to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.
When you visit the Site and other sites in their advertising network, the sites tag your computer with a "cookie." This cookie alone does not personally identify you, but it does allow the advertiser to recognize your computer when you visit any of their network sites.
This permits them to target the types of ads and promotions they display to that particular computer.
The intent is to display only interest-based advertisements tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns and to minimize the number of advertisements that are not relevant to or appropriate for you.
How Our advertising companies use cookies and other web technologies is covered by their individual privacy policies and are not covered by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
If you do not wish to receive our advertising companies’ cookies, you may "opt-out" by using the following link to the Network Advertising Initiative (the "NAI").
The NAI has worked with the Federal Trade Commission to develop a set of self-regulatory industry standards - The NAI Principles - that address how third party advertising networks may use information about you. "Click here" for more information on NAI.
Additional information regarding interest-based advertising and your opt-out rights can be found at Digital Advertising Alliance's www.aboutads.info site.
At the present time our Site is not configured to automatically respond to "do not track" signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads, however, you have other methods of opting-out of interest-based advertisements as described above.<br>
