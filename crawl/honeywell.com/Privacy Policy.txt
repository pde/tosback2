<p> </p>
<p>
<b>9) Cookies and similar technologies; web analytics</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>What is a cookie? </b>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your hard disk or to your browser's memory when you visit one of our Sites.
Cookies are useful because they help arrange the content and layout of our Sites and allow us to recognize those computers or other devices that have been to our Sites before.
Cookies do many different jobs, such as allowing our Sites to remember your preference settings and helping us to enhance the usability and performance of our Sites and your experience using them.</p>
<p>Our Sites also may contain electronic images known as web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow us to count the number of users who have visited specific pages.
We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Categories of cookies and similar technologies that we use </b>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of cookie or similar technology that may be used on our Sites can be put into 1 of 4 categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality &amp.
Profile and Advertising.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<b>1.
Strictly Necessary Cookies</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies are essential for basic functionalities of the Site, and they enable you to move around our Sites and use their features, particularly in connection with information searches and order placement.
Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.
These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
Examples of strictly necessary cookies are a shopping basket cookie, which is used to remember the products that you wish to purchase when you add products to your shopping basket or proceed to checkout, a login/ authentication cookie which allows and manages your login to the Site and identifies you after logging in for a single session, a session cookie which is required to carry out the data transmission and provide the Site to you, a security cookie that detects repeat failed login attempts or similar abuses of the Sites.
These types of cookies are regularly stored only as long as required for their purpose.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Performance Cookies</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies collect information about how you use our Sites, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages.
These cookies collect information that is used to improve how our Sites work.
Without these cookies we cannot learn how our Sites are performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.
Examples of performance cookies that our Sites use include cookies from Google and Adobe Analytics (see further discussion below).</p>
<p>
<b>3.
Functionality &amp.
Profile Cookies</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies allow our Sites to store information that you provide, such as preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions with our Sites.
For instance, they remember your user ID and elements of your user profile.
They also ensure that your experience using the Sites is relevant to you.
They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog (without being a cookie that is strictly necessary for the Site to function, see category 1).
These cookies will not be used to track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
<p>Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you have previously made or personalize your browsing experience.
For example, we use a cookie to store your language preferences, which allows us to present you with product search results in the correct language, and we use a cookie to store your choice about the appearance of the cookie information banner that we display on our Sites.
This cookie will help us remember your choice about the appearance of the cookie information banner when you subsequently visit the same site where you made your choice about the banner and any other Company sites with the same domain or the same top-level domain.</p>
<p>
<b>4.
Advertising Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies or similar technologies may be used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests.
They may also be used to limit the times you see an advertisement as well as help to measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
These cookies may track your visits to other websites.
Without these cookies or other technologies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>We permit third-party advertising partners (see below) to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you use our Sites, including products that you browse or purchase and your location.
Examples of advertising cookies or similar technologies that we use include Google AdWords and Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Setting your cookie preference</b>
<br>
<br>
You can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies and you can withdraw your consent at any time by modifying the settings of your browser to reject or disable cookies or by opting out of specific cookies through the opt-out options shared below.
If you choose to decline cookies altogether, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Sites that you visit.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Our use of web analytics</b>
<br>
<br>
We use industry standard web analytics to track visits to our sites (“Web Analytics Providers”).  The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by our Web Analytic Providers on their servers.
The Web Analytics Providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Sites, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage (as specified below).
The Web Analytics Providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf.</p>
<p>We use different analytic tools which serve the purpose of measuring, analyzing and optimizing our marketing measures and provide you with customized advertisements that could be of particular interest to you.
In particular, we use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, service of Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter collects information directly from the usage of the Sites by integrating its advertising technology.
This information includes browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on the Sites.

<b>Google Analytics and DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, both services of Google Inc.

The information collected (IP address, browsing activities and other data linked to your usage of the Sites, e.g.
referring site details, tape of web browser and operating system, clicks on external links, interaction with site specific widgets) is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
However, because of the IP anonymisation which we have activated on the portal, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union/ European Economic Area beforehand (if you are browsing the Site in the EU/ EEA).
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
You can opt out of Google Analytics by following the link below:</li>

<b>DoubleClick</b> is a tool to manage digital advertising.
<b>Floodlight</b> captures and reports on conversions – activities of website users after they have seen or clicked on an advertisement – and sets up target audiences to optimize marketing measures and campaigns.
You can opt out by changing your browser settings as described above.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, our Sites use the <b>Google Tag Manager</b> by Google, which helps to manage website tags through a single interface.
The tool itself (implementing the tags) triggers other tags that may themselves collect (personal) data.
However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Session Cam</b> – our sites use SessionCam to create recordings of website visitor navigation to identify usability issues for our visitors.
The visitor information collected by SessionCam and is anonymous and does not included any PII (personally identifiable information).
As part of this, SessionCam records mouse movements, clicks, mobile gestures, form input, scrolling.
To find out more about how Session Cam uses cookies, view SessionCam's privacy policy.
As an individual user, you can choose so that all your anonymous website activity is not recorded by SessionCam. This can be done by clicking here: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.  You will be taken to a page on the SessionCam website where you can switch off recording by SessionCam by clicking a single button.
If you choose to do this, a cookie is set on your browser which is then used by SessionCam to indicate that any visits from your device will not be recorded.
Data collected by this service is used to improve our website usability.
The information collected is stored and used for aggregated and statistical reporting and evaluated to improve the functionality of our websites for our visitors. <br>

<li>The Sites uses <b>Facebook Custom Audience</b>, a service provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, a remarketing service that allows us to address visitors to our Sites via Facebook with advertising placed by us.
The display of personalized advertising is based on an analysis of the use of our Sites using cookies and comparable technologies, such as tracking pixels, which enables us to identify customers that eventually convert to a lead from a Facebook.com campaign.
This helps us prove the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Furthermore, the service allows us to monitor website activity to build audiences so that we can further re-target communications to them based on their visit to the Sites.

</p>
<p>وفقًا للقانون المعمول به، يجوز لنا إغفال مصدر معلوماتك الشخصية بحيث لا يمكن استخدامها لتحديد هويتك.

<p> </p>
<p>
<b>5) مدة احتفاظنا بالمعلومات</b>

فعلى سبيل المثال، نقوم بتخزين المعلومات الشخصية المطلوبة لتزويدك بالمنتجات والخدمات أو لتسهيل المعاملات التي طلبتها طوال مدة بقائك عميلاً لشركتنا.
ونقوم كذلك بتخزين المعلومات الشخصية لأغراض التسويق حتى تلغي اشتراكك من خدمة تلقي الرسائل التسويقية المباشرة وفقًا للقانون المعمول به.
في حالة قيامك بتقديم طلب توظيف عبر مواقعنا، فسوف نحتفظ بتفاصيل طلبك على النحو الموضح في بيان الخصوصية أو أي إشعار آخر تم توفيره لك فيما يتعلق بطلبك أو وفقًا لما يقتضيه القانون.
ونقوم في جميع الأحوال الأخرى بتخزين معلوماتك الشخصية طالما هناك حاجة إليها لتحقيق الأغراض المنصوص عليها في بيان الخصوصية الماثل، وبعد ذلك يتم إغفال مصدرها (متى سمح القانون المعمول به بذلك) أو حذفها أو إتلافها.</p>

<b>9) ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة؛ تحليلات الويب</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>ما المقصود بملف تعريف الارتباط؟</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>هي ملفات نصية تحتوي على كميات قليلة من المعلومات التي يتم تنزيلها إلى محرك الأقراص الصلب الخاص بك أو إلى ذاكرة المتصفح الخاص بك عندما تزور أحد مواقعنا.
وهي مفيدة لأنها تساعد في تنظيم محتوى وتصميم مواقعنا وتسمح لنا بالتعرف على أجهزة الكمبيوتر أو غيرها من الأجهزة التي استخدمت مواقعنا سابقًا.
ولملفات تعريف الارتباط وظائف مختلفة؛ فهي تسمح لمواقعنا بتذكر إعدادات تفضيلاتك وتساعدنا في تحسين قابلية استخدام مواقعنا وأدائها وتجربتك في استخدامها.</p>
<p>قد تحتوي مواقعنا كذلك على صور إلكترونية تُعرف باسم إشارات الويب - تُسمى أحيانًا صور جي آي اف (gifs) أحادية البكسل - والتي تسمح لنا بحساب عدد المستخدمين الذي قاموا بزيارة الصفحات.
وقد نُدرج كذلك إشارات ويب في رسائل البريد الإلكتروني الترويجية أو الرسائل الإخبارية من أجل تحديد ما إذا تم فتح الرسائل واستخدامها أم لا.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>فئات ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة التي نستخدمها </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>يمكن تصنيف نوع ملف تعريف الارتباط أو التقنية المشابهة التي قد تُستخدم في مواقعنا إلى أحد أربع فئات: ضرورية للغاية، الأداء، الوظيفية والملف التعريفي، الإعلان.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<b>.1 ملفات تعريف الارتباط الضرورية للغاية</b>
</p>
<p>هذه الملفات ضرورية لوظائف الموقع الأساسية، وتمّكنك من الانتقال في مواقعنا واستخدام مزاياها ولا سيما فيما يتعلق بالبحث عن المعلومات وإيداع الطلبات.
ومن دون ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه لا يمكن توفير الخدمات التي طلبتها.
ولا تحصل ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه على معلوماتك التي يمكن استخدامها للتسويق أو تذكر الصفحات التي زرتها على الإنترنت.
تشمل أمثلة ملفات تعريف الارتباط الضرورية للغاية ملف سلة التسوق الذي يُستخدم لتذكر المنتجات التي ترغب في شرائها عند قيامك بإضافة المنتجات إلى سلة التسوق أو الانتقال إلى الدفع، ملف التصديق/تسجيل الدخول الذي يتيح وينظم تسجيل دخولك إلى الموقع ويتعرف عليك بعد تسجيل الدخول لجلسة واحدة، ملف الجلسة اللازم لتنفيذ نقل البيانات وإتاحة الموقع لك، ملف الأمن الذي يرصد محاولات تسجيل الدخول الفاشلة المتكررة أو إساءة الاستخدام المماثلة للمواقع.
ويتم تخزين هذه الأنواع من ملفات تعريف الارتباط بانتظام فقط طالما كانت لازمة للغرض منها.</p>
<p>
<b>.2 ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالأداء</b>
</p>
<p>تجمع ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه معلومات حول كيفية استخدامك لمواقعنا، على سبيل المثال ما هي الصفحات التي تزورها كثيرًا وإذا ما تلقيت أي رسائل خطأ من صفحات معينة.
وتجمع ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه المعلومات المستخدمة لتحسين كيفية عمل مواقعنا.
ومن دون ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه لا يمكننا معرفة أداء مواقعنا وإجراء التحسينات ذات الصلة التي تحسن من تجربة التصفح خاصتك.
تشمل أمثلة ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالأداء التي تستخدمها مواقعنا ملفات تعريف الارتباط من جوجل وتحليلات أدوبي (يُرجى الاطلاع على الشرح الإضافي أدناه).</p>
<p>
<b>.3 ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالوظيفية والملفات التعريفية</b>
</p>
<p>تتيح ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه لمواقعنا تخزين المعلومات التي تقدمها مثل التفضيلات، وتخزين المعلومات الفنية المفيدة لتفاعلاتك مع مواقعنا.
على سبيل المثال، تتذكر ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه معرِّف المستخدم الخاص بك وعناصر الملف التعريفي للمستخدم الخاص بك.
وتضمن ملفات تعريف الارتباط أيضًا ملائمة تجربة استخدامك لمواقعنا لك.
وقد تُستخدم كذلك لتوفير الخدمات التي طلبتها؛ مثل مشاهدة مقطع فيديو أو إضافة تعليق على مدونة (دون أن يكون ملف تعريف ارتباط ضروري للغاية لعمل الموقع، راجع الفئة 1).
ولن تُستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه لتتبع نشاط التصفح على المواقع الإلكترونية الأخرى.</p>
<p>من دون ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه لا يمكن للموقع تذكر الخيارات التي قمت بها سابقًا أو تخصيص تجربة التصفح الخاصة بك.
فعلى سبيل المثال، نستخدم ملف تعريف الارتباط لتخزين تفضيلاتك للغة مما يتيح لنا إصدار نتائج بحث عن المنتجات باللغة الصحيحة، ونستخدم ملف تعريف الارتباط كذلك لتخزين خيارك بشأن ظهور شعار معلومات ملف تعريف الارتباط الذي نعرضه على مواقعنا.
وسيساعدنا ملف تعريف الارتباط هذا على تذكر خيارك بشأن ظهور شعار معلومات ملف تعريف الارتباط عند تكرار زيارتك لنفس الموقع الذي أجريت به خيارك بشأن الشعار وأي مواقع أخرى للشركة لها نفس النطاق أو النطاق من المستوى الأعلى ذاته.</p>
<p>
<b>.4 ملفات تعريف الارتباط الإعلانية والتقنيات المشابهة</b>
</p>
<p>قد تُستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه والتقنيات المشابهة لتقديم إعلانات وثيقة الصلة باهتماماتك.
وقد تُستخدم كذلك لتقييد مرات رؤيتك للإعلان فضلاً عن المساعدة في قياس مدى فعالية الحملة الإعلانية.
قد تتبّع ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه زياراتك إلى المواقع الإلكترونية الأخرى.
ومن دون ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه أو التقنيات الأخرى لن تكون الإعلانات التي تشاهدها عبر الإنترنت ذات صلة باهتماماتك.</p>
<p>عِلمًا بأننا نسمح لشركاء الإعلانات الخارجيين (راجع التفاصيل الواردة أدناه) باستخدام ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات الأخرى من أجل جمع المعلومات عن أنشطة التصفح خاصتك مع الوقت وبين مختلف المواقع الإلكترونية عند استخدامك لمواقعنا، بما في ذلك المنتجات التي تتصفحها أو تشتريها وموقعك.
تشمل أمثلة ملفات تعريف الارتباط الإعلانية والتقنيات المشابهة التي نستخدمها جوجل أدووردز (Google AdWords) وبيكسل فيسبوك (Facebook Pixels).</p>
<p>
<b>تعيين تفضيلاتك لملفات تعريف الارتباط<br>
<br>
</b>يمكنك عادةً تعديل إعدادات المتصفح لرفض ملفات تعريف الارتباط، ويمكنك سحب موافقتك في أي وقت بتعديل إعدادات المتصفح لرفض الملفات أو تعطيلها أو بإلغاء الاشتراك في ملفات معينة من خلال خيارات إلغاء الاشتراك المشتركة أدناه.<b> </b>إذا اخترت رفض جميع ملفات تعريف الارتباط، فقد لا تتمكن من استخدام مزايا المواقع التي تزورها كاملةً.<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>استخدامنا لأدوات تحليل الويب<br>
</b>
<br>
نستخدم تحليلات ويب قياسية حسب القطاع لتتبع الزيارات إلى مواقعنا ("مقدمو خدمات أدوات تحليل الويب").  ويتم نقل المعلومات التي يصدرها ملف تعريف الارتباط حول استخدامك لمواقعنا (بما في عنوان بروتوكول الإنترنت (IP) الخاص بك) إلى مقدمي خدمات أدوات تحليل الويب وتخزينها من قِبلهم على الخوادم الخاصة بهم.
ويستخدم مقدمو خدمات أدوات تحليل الويب تلك المعلومات بغرض تقييم تجربة استخدامك لمواقعنا، وإعداد التقارير حول نشاط الموقع الإلكتروني ورفعها لمشغلي الموقع وتوفير الخدمات الأخرى المتعلقة بنشاط الموقع واستخدام الإنترنت (على النحو المحدد أدناه).
وقد يقوم مقدمو خدمات أدوات تحليل الويب كذلك بنقل هذه المعلومات إلى جهات خارجية عند الحاجة للقيام بذلك بموجب القانون أو عند قيام هذه الجهة الخارجية بمعالجة المعلومات بالنيابة عنهم.</p>
<p>نستخدم أدوات تحليلية مختلفة بهدف قياس وتحليل وتعزيز إجراءات التسويق، وتزويدك بالإعلانات المخصصة التي قد تكون محل اهتمام خاص لك.

<p>9.      <b>Cookie 和类似技术；Web 分析</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>什么是 Cookie？ </b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookie 是包含少量信息的文本文件，当您访问我们的站点之一时，该信息会下载到您的硬盘或浏览器内存中。Cookie 很有用，因为它们有助于组织我们站点的内容和布局，并让我们可以识别以前曾访问过我们站点的计算机或其他设备。Cookie 可执行许多不同的工作，例如让我们的站点记住您的首选设置，帮助我们提高站点的可用性和性能，并改善您使用这些站点的体验。</p>
<p>另外，我们的站点可能包含称为网站信标的电子图像（有时称为“单点图”），用于计算访问过特定页面的用户数。我们可能会将网站信标包含在促销电子邮件或新闻快递中，以便于确定是否已打开邮件并对其执行操作。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>我们使用的 Cookie 和类似技术的类别</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>我们站点上可能使用的 Cookie 或类似技术的类型可归为 4 个类别中的 1 个类别：“严格必要”、“性能”、“功能和概况”以及“广告宣传”。</p>
<p>
<b>1.    严格必要 Cookie</b>
</p>
<p>这些 Cookie 对于站点的基本功能至关重要，它们可以让您在我们的站点中四处移动并使用其功能，尤其是在搜索信息和下达订单时。如果没有这些 Cookie，则将无法提供您所要求的服务。这些 Cookie 不会收集有关您的可用于营销或记住您在 Internet 上所处位置的信息。严格必要 Cookie 的示例包括用于在您将产品添加到购物篮或继续结账时记住您想要购买的产品的购物篮 Cookie、允许和管理站点登录并在针对单个会话进行登录后标识您身份的登录/身份验证 Cookie、进行数据传输并为您提供网站所必需的会话 Cookie、检测重复失败登录尝试或类似站点滥用情况的安全 Cookie。通常只会在目的持续期内存储这些类型的 Cookie。</p>
<p>
<b>2.    性能 Cookie</b>
</p>
<p>这些 Cookie 会收集有关您如何使用我们站点的信息，例如您最常访问的页面，以及您是否从某些页面收到任何错误消息。这些 Cookie 会收集用于改进我们站点的工作方式的信息。如果没有这些 Cookie，我们将无法获悉我们站点的性能，并进行相关改进以改进您的浏览体验。例如，我们站点使用的性能 Cookie 包括来自 Google 和 Adobe Analytics 的 Cookie（请参见下文的深入讨论）。</p>
<p>
<b>3.    功能和概况 Cookie</b>
</p>
<p>这些 Cookie 让我们的站点可以存储您提供的信息，例如首选项，以及存储对于您与我们的站点进行交互有用的技术信息。例如，它们可记住您的用户 ID 和您的用户配置文件的元素。它们还可确保您使用这些站点的体验与您相关。此外，它们可用于向您提供所要求的服务，例如观看视频或评论博客（无需是使站点正常运行而严格必要的 Cookie，请参阅类别 1）。这些 Cookie 将不用于跟踪您在其他网站上的浏览活动。</p>
<p>如果没有这些 Cookie，网站就无法记住您之前进行的选择或个性化您的浏览体验。例如，我们可以使用 Cookie 存储您的语言首选项，从而让我们以正确的语言向您显示产品搜索结果，我们也可以使用 Cookie 存储您对我们在站点上显示的 Cookie 信息横幅外观所做的选择 当您以后访问您对横幅做出选择的同一个站点和同一个域或同一个顶级域内任何其他公司站点时，此 Cookie 将帮助我们记住您对 Cookie 信息横幅外观所做的选择。</p>
<p>
<b>4.    广告宣传 Cookie 和类似技术</b>
</p>
<p>这些 Cookie 或类似技术可用于提供与您和您的兴趣更相关的广告。它们也可用于限制您看到某个广告的次数，以及帮助衡量广告宣传活动的效果。这些 Cookie 可以跟踪您对其他网站的访问。如果没有这些 Cookie 或其他技术，您看见的在线广告与您和您的兴趣的相关性将会更低。</p>
<p>我们允许第三方广告合作伙伴（请参阅下文）使用 Cookie 和其他技术，在您使用我们的站点时，随时跨不同网站收集与您的浏览活动有关的信息，包括您浏览或购买的产品以及您所在的位置。例如，我们使用的广告宣传 Cookie 或类似技术包括 Google AdWords 和 Facebook Pixels。</p>
<p>
<b>设置 Cookie 首选项<br>
</b>
<br>
通常来说，您可以将浏览器设置修改为拒绝 Cookie，也可以通过修改浏览器设置以拒绝或禁用 Cookie，或通过使用下面共享的退出选项选择退出特定的 Cookie，随时撤销您的同意。如果您选择完全拒绝 Cookie，则可能无法完全体验到所访问站点的功能。</p>
<p>
<b>我们对 Web 分析的使用<br>
<br>
</b>我们使用行业标准 Web 分析来跟踪对我们站点的访问（“Web 分析提供程序”）。由 Cookie 生成的与您使用我们的站点有关的信息，包括您的 IP 地址，将由我们的“Web 分析提供程序”传输并存储在它们的服务器上。“Web 分析提供程序”将使用此信息来评估您对我们站点的使用，为网站运营商编制有关网站活动的报告，并提供与网站活动和 Internet 使用有关的其他服务（如下所述）。在法律要求这样做的情况下，或此类第三方代表“Web 分析提供程序”处理信息的情况下，它们可能还会将该信息传输给第三方。</p>
<p>我们使用不同的分析工具，用于衡量、分析和优化我们的营销措施，并为您提供您可能特别感兴趣的定制广告宣传。具体来讲，我们使用以下工具：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>，Twitter, Inc.（“Twitter”）的服务。Twitter 通过整合其广告宣传技术直接从站点的使用中收集信息。此信息包括浏览器 Cookie ID、移动设备 ID、哈希电子邮件地址、人口统计或兴趣数据以及在站点上查看的内容或采取的操作。您可以通过单击下面的链接选择退出 Twitter Advertising：</li>
</ul>
<p>Twitter Advertising 选择退出链接</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Google Analytics 和 DoubleClick Floodlight</b>，两者都是 Google Inc.（“Google”）的服务：Google Analytics 使用 Cookie 来分析您对站点的使用情况。收集的信息（IP 地址、浏览活动和与您使用站点相关的其他数据，例如引用站点详细信息、Web 浏览器和操作系统的类型、外部链接点击次数、与站点特定小部件的交互）通常会传输并存储在位于美国的 Google 服务器中。但是，由于我们在门户网站上启用了 IP 匿名化处理，Google 将事先在欧盟/欧洲经济区成员国内简化您的 IP 地址（如果您在欧盟/欧洲经济区浏览该站点）。只有在特殊情况下，才会将完整的 IP 地址传输到位于美国的 Google 服务器并在那里缩短。据 Google 称，由您的浏览器在 Google Analytics 框架内传输的 IP 地址不会与其他 Google 数据合并。您可以单击下面的链接选择退出 Google Analytics：</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Analytics 选择退出链接</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> 是一款用于管理数字广告的工具。<b>Floodlight</b> 捕获和报告转换数据（网站用户在查看或单击广告后的活动）并设置目标受众，以优化营销措施和活动。您可以按上面所述，通过更改浏览器设置来选择退出。</p>
<p>·         此外，我们的站点还使用 Google 提供的 <b>Google Tag Manager</b>，它可帮助通过单一界面管理网站标签。工具本身（实施标签）可触发可能自动收集（个人）数据的其他标签。不过，Google Tag Manager 不会访问此数据。</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>SessionCam</b>——我们的网站使用 SessionCam 创建网站访问者的导航记录，以确定访问者在网站上遇到的可用性问题。SessionCam 会收集访问者信息，这些信息都是匿名的，且不包括任何 PII（个人身份信息）。在此过程中，SessionCam 会记录鼠标的移动、点击、移动手势、表单输入、滚动等情况。如需详细了解 SessionCam 如何使用 Cookie，请查看 SessionCam 的隐私政策。作为个人用户，您可以选择不让 SessionCam 记录您的所有匿名网站活动。为此，您可点击此处：https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.

<p>·         站点还使用 Adobe Inc.（“Adobe”）提供的服务，具体是 <b>Adobe Audience Manager</b>，它是一款数据管理平台，可帮助我们建立独特的受众群体配置文件，以便我们可以识别我们最有价值的细分市场，同时还使用 <b>Adobe Analytics</b>，它可以让我们分析网站的使用情况，以便优化其设计和可用性，并使其更好地适应我们网站访问者的需求。为此，Adobe Analytics 将收集个人数据，例如您的 IP 地址和其他标识符、使用情况信息、电子邮件地址和位置数据。您可以通过单击下面的链接选择退出 Adobe Analytics 服务：</p>
<p>Adobe Analytics 选择退出链接</p>
<p>·         站点使用 <b>Facebook Custom Audience</b>，这是一款由 Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA 提供的服务，它是一种再营销服务，可以让我们通过 Facebook 将访问者引导到我们投放了广告的站点。是否显示个性化广告取决于使用 Cookie 和类似技术（例如跟踪像素）对站点使用情况进行的分析，它使我们能够识别通过 Facebook.com 营销活动最终转化为潜在客户的客户。这可帮助我们证明营销活动的有效性。此外，该服务允许我们监控网站活动以赢得受众，以便我们可以根据他们对本站点的访问，进一步调整通信目标。由此而论，在您选择加入并通过填写表格或以其他方式与我们联系来提供数据之前，我们不会知道任何个人数据。</p>

<p>您可以通过单击下面的链接选择退出 AddThis：</p>
<p>AddThis 选择退出链接</p>
<p>Marketo cookie 用于衡量用户对我们站点、在线活动、广告宣传和在线内容（如白皮书下载）的参与度。该 Cookie 允许将用户链接到电子邮件营销活动的收件人以衡量活动效果。收集的个人数据可能包括以下内容：访问时间、访问的页面、引用站点详细信息、Web 浏览器和操作系统的类型、站点上的交互、网络位置、IP 地址、文档下载、指向外部网站的链接的单击次数。我们在 Marketo 提供的服务中使用 IP 匿名化功能。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10.   <b> 请勿跟踪</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
有些 Web 浏览器可能会向用户与之通信的站点发送“请勿跟踪”信号。由于 Web 浏览器合并和激活此功能的方式不同，因此并非总是清楚用户是否有意发送这些信号，或者他们是否知道这些信号。目前，我们没有采取任何措施，来应对这些信号。</p>

<p>
<b>Používání webových analýz<br>
<br>
</b>Ke sledování návštěv našich webových stránek používáme standardní webové analýzy (dále jen „poskytovatelé webových analýz“).
Informace generované souborem cookie o vašem používání našich webových stránek (včetně vaší IP adresy) budou přeneseny k našim poskytovatelům webových analýz a uloženy na jejich serverech.
Poskytovatelé webových analýz tyto údaje použijí k vyhodnocení toho, jak naše webové stránky používáte, dále k sestavení zpráv o aktivitě webové stránky pro provozovatele webu a k poskytování dalších služeb spojených s aktivitou na webu a využitím internetu (jak je upřesněno níže).
Poskytovatelé webových analýz také mohou tyto údaje předat třetím stranám, pokud to vyžaduje zákon nebo tyto třetí strany zpracovávají údaje jejich jménem.</p>
<p>Používáme různé analytické nástroje, které slouží k měření, analýze a optimalizaci našich marketingových nástrojů a poskytují vám přizpůsobené reklamy, které by vás mohly zajímat.
Používáme zejména následující nástroje:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, servis služby Twitter, Inc., (dále jen „Twitter“).
Twitter shromažďuje informace přímo z používání daných stránek díky své integrované reklamní technologii.
Tyto informace zahrnují ID souborů cookie prohlížeče, ID mobilního zařízení, e-mailové adresy s hashem, demografická data nebo data o zájmech a zobrazený obsah nebo akce provedené na stránkách.
Odhlásit se ze služby Twitter Advertising můžete prostřednictvím následujícího odkazu:</li>

<b>Google Analytics a DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, obě služby společnosti Google Inc.
(dále jen „Google“): Služba Google Analytics používá soubory cookie, které umožňují analýzu vašeho používání stránek.
Shromážděné informace (IP adresa, aktivity procházení a další údaje související s používáním těchto stránek, např.
podrobnosti o webu, ze kterého uživatel přišel, páska webového prohlížeče a operačního systému, kliknutí na externí odkazy, interakce s miniaplikacemi specifickými pro daný web) jsou obvykle přeneseny na server služby Google v USA, kde jsou uloženy.
Kvůli anonymizaci IP adres, kterou jsme na portálu aktivovali, však Google nejprve zredukuje vaši IP adresu v rámci členských států Evropské unie / Evropského hospodářského prostoru (pokud si prohlížíte stránku v EU/EHP).
Pouze ve výjimečných případech bude vaše plná IP adresa přenesena na server Google v USA a zkrácena až tam.
Podle společnosti Google nebude IP adresa, kterou váš prohlížeč odeslal v rámci služby Google Analytics, sloučena s jinými údaji Google.
Službu Google Analytics můžete zrušit na následujícím odkazu:</li>

<b>DoubleClick</b> je nástroj pro správu digitální reklamy.
<b>Floodlight</b> zachycuje a podává zprávy o konverzích – tj.
o činnosti uživatelů webu poté, co viděli nebo klikli na reklamu – a nastaví cílové publikum, aby optimalizoval marketingové nástroje a kampaně.
Můžete se odhlásit změnou nastavení vašeho prohlížeče, jak je popsáno výše.</p>
<p>·         Naše stránky dále používají <b>Správce značek Google</b> od společnosti Google, který pomáhá spravovat značky (tagy) webových stránek prostřednictvím jediného rozhraní.
Nástroj samotný (implementace značek) spouští další značky, které mohou samy shromažďovat (osobní) data.
Správce značek Google však k těmto datům nemá přístup.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies er tekstfiler, der indeholder små mængder oplysninger, som downloades til din harddisk eller til din browsers hukommelse, når du besøger et af vores Websteder.
Cookies er nyttige, fordi de gør det nemmere at arrangere indholdet og layoutet af vores Websteder og giver os mulighed for at genkende de computere eller enheder, der tidligere har besøgt vores Websteder.
Cookies har mange forskellige funktioner.
De gør det f.eks.
muligt for vores Websteder at huske dine præferencer og hjælper os med at forbedre brugervenligheden og ydeevnen på vores Websteder og din oplevelse af dem.</p>
<p>Vores Websteder indeholder også elektroniske billeder, der hedder webbeacons – kaldes også sommetider for enkeltpixel-gifs – der giver os mulighed for at tælle det antal brugere, som har besøgt bestemte sider.
Vi kan også medtage webbeacons i salgsmails eller nyhedsbreve for at kunne bestemme, om meddelelserne er blevet åbnet, og om modtageren reagerede.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Kategorier af cookies og lignende teknologier, som vi bruger</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>De cookietyper eller lignende teknologier, der kan blive brugt på vores Websteder, kan inddeles i 1 til 4 kategorier: Strengt nødvendig, Ydeevne, Funktionalitet og profil samt Annoncering.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Strengt nødvendige cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Disse cookies er nødvendige til Webstedets grundlæggende funktioner, og de gør det muligt for dig at bevæge dig rundt på vores Websteder og bruge funktionerne, især i forbindelse med informationssøgninger og afgivelse af bestillinger.
Uden disse cookies er det ikke muligt at levere de tjenester, du har bedt om.
Disse cookies indsamler ikke oplysninger om dig, der kan anvendes til marketing eller registrering af dine handlinger på internettet.
Eksempler på strengt nødvendige cookies er en cookie til indkøbskurven, der bruges til at huske de produkter, du ønsker at købe, når du lægger produkter i din indkøbskurv eller fortsætter til kassen, en cookie til logon/godkendelse, der giver dig mulighed for og styrer din logon på Webstedet og identificerer dig, når du har logget på til en enkelt session, en sessionscookie, der kræves for at udføre en dataoverførsel og levere Webstedet til dig, en sikkerhedscookie, der registrerer antal mislykkede logonforsøg eller lignende misbrug af Webstederne.

<b>Vores brug af webanalyser<br>
<br>
</b>Vi bruger branchens standardwebanalyseværktøjer til at spore besøg på vores websteder ("Webanalyseleverandører").
De oplysninger, som genereres af cookien om din brug af vores Websteder (herunder din IP-adresse), overføres til og lagres af vores Webanalyseleverandører på deres servere.
Webanalyseleverandørerne bruger disse oplysninger til at evaluere din brug af vores Websteder, generere rapporter over webstedsaktivitet for webstedsoperatører og levere andre tjenester vedrørende webstedsaktivitet og internetbrug (som angivet herunder).
Webanalyseleverandørerne kan også overføre disse oplysninger til tredjeparter, hvis lovgivningen kræver det, eller hvis disse tredjeparter behandler oplysningerne på deres vegne.</p>
<p>Vi anvender forskellige analyseværktøjer, der bruges til at måle, analysere og optimere vores marketingforanstaltninger og give dig tilpassede annoncer, der kan være af særlig interesse for dig.
Især bruger vi følgende værktøjer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, tjeneste fra Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter indsamler oplysninger direkte fra brugen af Webstederne ved at integrere dets reklameteknologi.

<b>Google Analytics og DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, begge tjenester er fra Google Inc.
("Google"): Google Analytics bruger cookies, som muliggør en analyse af din brug af Webstederne.
De indsamlede oplysninger (IP-adresse, browsingaktiviteter og andre data, der er knyttet til din brug af Webstederne, f.eks.
detaljer om henvisende websteder, registrering af webbrowser og operativsystem, klik på eksterne links, interaktion med webstedsspecifikke widgets) overføres normalt til en Google-server i USA og lagres der.
På grund af den IP-anonymisering, som vi har aktiveret på portalen, reducerer Google imidlertid på forhånd din IP-adresse inden for EU-/EØS-landene (hvis du surfer på webstedet i EU/EØS).
Det er kun i undtagelsestilfælde, at den fulde IP-adresse sendes til en Google-server i USA og forkortes der.
Ifølge Google vil IP-adressen, der overføres af din browser inden for rammerne af Google Analytics, ikke blive flettet sammen med andre Google-data.
Du kan fravælge Google Analytics ved at følge nedenstående link:</li>

</ul>
<p>Cookies zijn tekstbestanden die kleine hoeveelheden informatie bevatten en die worden gedownload naar uw vaste schijf of naar het geheugen van uw browser wanneer u een van onze Sites bezoekt.
Cookies zijn nuttig omdat ze helpen bij het ordenen van de inhoud en lay-out van onze Sites en ons in staat stellen om computers of andere apparaten te herkennen die eerder op onze Sites zijn geweest.
Cookies hebben veel verschillende functies, zoals toestaan dat onze Sites uw voorkeursinstellingen onthouden en ons helpen de bruikbaarheid en prestaties van onze Sites en uw gebruikservaring te verbeteren.</p>
<p>Onze Sites kunnen ook elektronische afbeeldingen bevatten, de zogenaamde webbakens of single-pixel gifs, waarmee we het aantal gebruikers kunnen tellen dat specifieke pagina's heeft bezocht.
We kunnen ook webbakens opnemen in promotieberichten of nieuwsbrieven die we per e-mail verzenden, om te bepalen of berichten zijn geopend en of er op deze berichten is gereageerd.</p>

<b>Categorieën van cookies en soortgelijke technologieën die we gebruiken</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>De typen cookies of soortgelijke technologieën die op onze Sites kunnen worden gebruikt, vallen in vier categorieën uiteen: Strikt noodzakelijk, Prestaties, Functionaliteit &amp.
profiel en Reclame.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Strikt noodzakelijke cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Deze cookies zijn cruciaal voor de basisfunctionaliteit van de Site en stellen u in staat om door onze Sites te navigeren en functies te gebruiken, met name in verband met zoekopdrachten en het plaatsen van bestellingen.
Zonder deze cookies kunnen services waarom u hebt gevraagd niet worden geleverd.
Deze cookies verzamelen geen gegevens over u die kunnen worden gebruikt voor marketing of om te onthouden waar u op internet bent geweest.
Voorbeelden van strikt noodzakelijke cookies zijn een cookie voor een winkelmandje waarmee de producten worden onthouden die u wilt kopen wanneer u ze toevoegt aan uw winkelmandje of gaat betalen, een cookie voor aanmelding/verificatie die uw aanmelding bij de Site toestaat en beheert en u na aanmelding voor een enkele sessie identificeert, een sessiecookie die vereist is om de gegevensoverdracht uit te voeren en om de Site aan u te leveren, en een beveiligingscookie die herhaalde mislukte aanmeldpogingen of soortgelijk misbruik van de Sites detecteert.
Deze soorten cookies worden regelmatig uitsluitend opgeslagen voor zolang ze nodig zijn voor hun doel.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Prestatiecookies</b>
</p>
<p>Deze cookies verzamelen informatie over hoe u onze Sites gebruikt, bijvoorbeeld naar welke pagina's u het meest gaat en of u foutberichten krijgt van bepaalde pagina's.
Deze cookies verzamelen informatie die wordt gebruikt om de werking van onze Sites te verbeteren.
Zonder deze cookies kunnen we niet te weten komen hoe onze Sites presteren en kunnen we geen relevante verbeteringen aanbrengen die uw surfervaring kunnen verbeteren.
Voorbeelden van prestatiecookies die onze Sites gebruiken, zijn cookies van Google en Adobe Analytics (zie de uitgebreidere bespreking hieronder).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Functionaliteits- &amp.
profielcookies</b>
</p>
<p>Onze Sites kunnen met behulp van deze cookies gegevens zoals voorkeuren bewaren die u verstrekt en technische gegevens bewaren die nuttig zijn bij uw interactie met onze Sites.
Ze onthouden bijvoorbeeld uw gebruikers-ID en elementen van uw gebruikersprofiel.
Ze zorgen er ook voor dat uw ervaring met het gebruik van de Sites voor u relevant is.
Ze kunnen ook worden gebruikt om services te leveren waar u om hebt gevraagd, zoals het bekijken van een video of het reageren op een blog (zonder dat dit cookies zijn die strikt noodzakelijk zijn voor de werking van de Site, zie categorie 1).
Deze cookies worden niet gebruikt om uw surfactiviteit op andere websites bij te houden.</p>
<p>Zonder deze cookies kan een website niet de keuzen onthouden die u eerder hebt gemaakt of uw surfervaring personaliseren.
We gebruiken bijvoorbeeld een cookie om uw taalvoorkeuren op te slaan, waardoor we u de zoekresultaten van producten in de juiste taal kunnen aanbieden.
We gebruiken ook een cookie om uw keuze op te slaan over het uiterlijk van de cookie-informatiebanner die we op onze Sites weergeven.
Deze cookie onthoudt uw keuze over het uiterlijk van de cookie-informatiebanner wanneer u vervolgens een bezoek brengt aan dezelfde site waar u uw keuze over de banner hebt gemaakt en aan andere bedrijfssites met hetzelfde domein of hoofddomein.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Reclamecookies en soortgelijke technologieën</b>
</p>
<p>Deze cookies of soortgelijke technologieën kunnen worden gebruikt om advertenties weer te geven die relevanter en interessanter voor u zijn.
Zij kunnen ook worden gebruikt om het aantal keren te beperken dat u een advertentie te zien krijgt en om de doelmatigheid van de reclamecampagne te helpen meten.
Deze cookies kunnen uw bezoeken aan andere websites bijhouden.
Zonder deze cookies of soortgelijke technologieën zijn online advertenties die aan u worden gepresenteerd minder relevant en interessant voor u.</p>
<p>We staan externe reclamepartners toe (zie hieronder) om cookies en andere technologieën te gebruiken om informatie over uw surfactiviteiten in de loop van de tijd en op verschillende websites te verzamelen wanneer u onze Sites gebruikt.
Deze informatie omvat ook producten die u bekijkt of koopt en uw locatie.
Voorbeelden van reclamecookies of soortgelijke technologieën die we gebruiken, zijn Google AdWords en Facebook-pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Uw cookievoorkeur instellen<br>

U kunt gewoonlijk uw browserinstellingen wijzigen om cookies te weigeren en u kunt uw toestemming op elk gewenst moment intrekken door de instellingen van uw browser aan te passen om cookies te weigeren of uit te schakelen of door specifieke cookies te weigeren via de afmeldopties die hieronder worden vermeld.
Als u ervoor kiest om cookies helemaal te weigeren, kunt u mogelijk de functies van de Sites die u bezoekt niet optimaal gebruiken.</p>
<p>
<b>Ons gebruik van webanalyses<br>
<br>
</b>We gebruiken industriestandaard webanalyses om bezoeken aan onze Sites bij te houden ("Providers van webanalyses").
De informatie over uw gebruik van onze Sites die door de cookie wordt gegenereerd (inclusief uw IP-adres), wordt verzonden naar en opgeslagen door onze Providers van webanalyses op hun servers.
De Providers van webanalyses gebruiken deze informatie om uw gebruik van onze Sites te evalueren, om rapporten over websiteactiviteit samen te stellen voor websitebeheerders en om andere services met betrekking tot websiteactiviteit en internetgebruik (zoals hieronder is aangegeven) aan te bieden.
De Providers van webanalyses kunnen deze informatie ook overdragen aan derden indien dit wettelijk verplicht is of wanneer dergelijke derden de informatie namens hen verwerken.</p>
<p>We gebruiken verschillende analytische tools die dienen om onze marketingmaatregelen te meten, te analyseren en te optimaliseren en om u gepersonaliseerde advertenties te bieden die voor u van bijzonder belang kunnen zijn.
We gebruiken met name de volgende tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Ads</b>, een service van Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter verzamelt informatie rechtstreeks via het gebruik van de Sites door zijn advertentietechnologie te integreren.
Deze informatie omvat browsercookie-ID's, ID's van mobiele apparaten, gehashte e-mailadressen, demografische of interessegegevens en op de Sites bekeken inhoud of ondernomen acties.
U kunt zich afmelden voor Twitter Ads door onderstaande koppeling te volgen:</li>

<b>Google Analytics en DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, beide services van Google Inc.
("Google"): Google Analytics maakt gebruik van cookies die een analyse van uw gebruik van de Sites mogelijk maken.
De verzamelde informatie (IP-adres, surfactiviteiten en andere gegevens die zijn gekoppeld aan uw gebruik van de Sites, zoals gegevens over doorverwijzing naar sites, het type webbrowser en besturingssysteem, klikken op externe koppelingen, interactie met sitespecifieke widgets) wordt meestal verzonden naar een server van Google in de VS en daar opgeslagen.
Maar vanwege de IP-anonimisering die we bij de portal hebben geactiveerd, kort Google uw IP-adres binnen de lidstaten van de Europese Unie/Europese Economische Ruimte vooraf in (als u de Site bezoekt in de EU/EER).
Alleen in uitzonderlijke gevallen wordt het volledige IP-adres naar een server van Google in de VS verzonden en daar ingekort.
Volgens Google wordt het door uw browser verzonden IP-adres binnen het kader van Google Analytics niet samengevoegd met andere gegevens van Google.
U kunt zich afmelden voor Google Analytics door de onderstaande koppeling te volgen:</li>

<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> is een tool voor het beheren van digitale advertenties.
<b>Floodlight</b> legt conversies vast en rapporteert daarover.
Conversies zijn activiteiten van websitegebruikers nadat ze een advertentie hebben gezien of hierop hebben geklikt.
Floodlight stelt tevens doelgroepen in om marketingmaatregelen en campagnes te optimaliseren.
U kunt zich afmelden door uw browserinstellingen te wijzigen, zoals hierboven is beschreven.</p>
<p>·         Bovendien gebruiken onze Sites <b>Google Tag Manager</b> van Google, dat helpt bij het beheren van websitetags via een enkele interface.
De tool zelf (het implementeren van de tags) triggert andere tags die zelf (persoonlijke) gegevens kunnen verzamelen.
Google Tag Manager heeft echter geen toegang tot deze gegevens.</p>
<p>

U krijgt een pagina op de SessionCam-website te zien waar u de opname met SessionCam kunt uitschakelen met één klik.
Als u hiervoor kiest, wordt er een cookie ingesteld op uw browser dat vervolgens door SessionCam wordt gebruikt om aan te geven dat bezoeken vanaf uw apparaat niet worden opgenomen.
Gegevens die door deze service worden verzameld, worden gebruikt om de bruikbaarheid van onze website te verbeteren.
De verzamelde informatie wordt opgeslagen en gebruikt voor samengevoegde en statistische rapportage en geëvalueerd om de functionaliteit van onze websites voor onze bezoekers te verbeteren.<i>

<p>·         De Sites gebruiken <b>Facebook Custom Audience</b>, een service van Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, VS.
Dit is een remarketingservice waarmee we bezoekers van onze Sites via Facebook kunnen benaderen met door ons geplaatste advertenties.
Het weergeven van gepersonaliseerde advertenties is gebaseerd op een analyse van het gebruik van onze Sites met behulp van cookies en vergelijkbare technologieën zoals trackingpixels.
Hiermee kunnen we klanten identificeren die uiteindelijk een lead van een Facebook.com-campagne worden.
Dit helpt ons om te bewijzen dat onze marketingcampagnes effectief zijn.
Verder stelt de service ons in staat om websiteactiviteit te volgen om doelgroepen te vormen, zodat we de communicatie nog meer op deze groepen kunnen richten op basis van hun bezoek aan de Sites.

</b>Beide services verzamelen gebruiks- en interactiegegevens, contactgegevens, IP-adressen en locatiegegevens en verwerken deze.
Wij gebruiken LinkedIn Ads om verkeer naar de Sites te leiden door op LinkedIn.com online advertenties aan te bieden die gebruikers uiteindelijk naar de Sites kunnen leiden.
We gebruiken LinkedIn Analytics om het succes van onze advertentiecampagnes te meten, zodat we kunnen zien welke gebruikers uiteindelijk op de Sites een lead worden.

<p>
<br>
Sommige webbrowsers kunnen signalen van het type “Niet bijhouden” doorzenden naar de Sites waarmee de gebruiker communiceert.Vanwege verschillen in de manier waarop webbrowsers deze functie inbouwen en activeren, is het niet altijd duidelijk of gebruikers willen dat die signalen worden doorgezonden of is het zelfs niet altijd duidelijk of ze zich ervan bewust zijn.Wij ondernemen momenteel geen actie in reactie op die signalen.</p>

<p>4.    <b>Tietojen anonymisointi</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Saatamme anonymisoida henkilötietojasi sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa siten, ettei sinua voida enää tunnistaa kyseisten tietojen perusteella.Anonymisoitujen tietojen ei katsota olevan henkilötietoja, eikä niihin sen vuoksi sovelleta tätä Tietosuojalausuntoa.Voimme kerätä, käyttää ja jakaa anonymisoituja tietoja missä tahansa tarkoituksessa.</p>
<p>5.    <b>Tietojen säilytysaika</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Henkilötietojesi säilytysaika vaihtelee sen mukaan, missä tarkoituksessa niitä käsitellään.Esimerkiksi henkilötiedot, joita tarvitaan tuotteiden ja palveluiden toimittamiseksi sinulle tai pyytämiesi tapahtumien toteuttamiseksi, säilytetään niin kauan kuin olet Yrityksen asiakas.Markkinointitarkoituksissa henkilötietoja säilytetään siihen saakka, kunnes kieltäydyt vastaanottamasta suoramarkkinointiviestintää sovellettavan lain mukaisesti.Jos lähetät työhakemuksen Sivustojemme kautta, säilytämme hakemuksesi tiedot työhakemuksesi yhteydessä saatavillesi tuodun tietosuojalausunnon tai muun ilmoituksen mukaisesti, ellei laissa toisin säädetä.Kaikissa muissa tapauksissa henkilötietojasi säilytetään niin kauan kuin se on tarpeen tässä tietosuojalausunnossa määriteltyjen tarkoitusten toteuttamiseksi, minkä jälkeen ne joko anonymisoidaan (sovellettavan lain sen salliessa), poistetaan tai tuhotaan.</p>
<p>6.    <b>Tietojen luovuttaminen</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Saatamme jakaa henkilötietojasi valittujen kolmansien osapuolten kanssa sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa muun muassa alla esitetyn mukaisesti.</p>
<p>·       <b>Konserniyhtiöt. </b>

<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Luovuttaminen yritysostojen tai divestointien yhteydessä. </b>
<br>
Joissakin olosuhteissa Yritys voi strategisista tai muista liiketoiminnallisista syistä päättää myydä, divestoida, fuusioitua tai muulla tavalla uudelleenorganisoida yrityksiä joissakin maissa.
Voimme luovuttaa sinusta säilyttämiämme tietoja kohtuullisessa määrin neuvottelujen jatkamiseksi tai fuusion, yritysoston, divestoinnin tai Yrityksen omaisuuden tai sen osan myynnin viimeistelemiseksi. <br>

</p>
<p>·       <b>Luovuttaminen muista syistä.</b>
<br>
Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietoja lain sitä edellyttäessä tai lain niin salliessa tai hyvässä uskossa siitä, että tällainen luovuttaminen on tarpeen laillisten vaatimusten tai meille asetetun oikeudenkäyntimenettelyn noudattamiseksi, oikeuksiemme tai omaisuutemme suojaamiseksi ja puolustamiseksi tai äkillisissä tilanteissa kenen tahansa henkilön turvallisuuden suojaamiseksi.</p>
<p>7.    <b>Kansainväliset siirrot</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Olemme kansainvälinen yritys.Kun käytät Sivustojamme tai vierailet niillä tai kun otat meihin yhteyttä ja annat meille tietojasi, hyväksyt, että henkilötietojasi voidaan sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa kerätä, siirtää ja käyttää Yrityksen, konserniyritysten, toimittajien, jakelijoiden ja muiden liiketoimintakumppaneiden ja/tai edustajien toimesta, jotka toimivat asuinmaasi ulkopuolisissa maissa, mukaan lukien muun muassa Yhdysvallat, Meksiko ja Intia.Huomaa, että näiden maiden tietosuoja ja lain vaatimukset, viranomaisten oikeus tarkastella henkilötietojasi mukaan lukien, eivät välttämättä vastaa oman asuinmaasi tietosuojaa ja lain vaatimuksia.Ryhdymme kuitenkin kohtuullisiin toimiin yksityisyytesi turvaamiseksi ja tarjotaksemme henkilötiedoillesi asuinmaasi tasoa vastaavan suojauksen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<b>Euroopan talousalueella (ETA) oleskelevat käyttäjät</b>
</p>
<p>Olemme yhdessä konserniyritystemme, palveluntarjoajiemme, urakoitsijoidemme, jakelijoidemme ja muiden liiketoimintakumppaneidemme ja edustajiemme kanssa ottaneet tarpeen mukaan käyttöön asianmukaiset suojauskeinot sen varmistamiseksi, että henkilötietojen siirto ETA-alueen ulkopuolelle tapahtuu asianmukaisen suojauksen alaisesti.Nämä suojauskeinot käsittävät yleensä EU:n vakiosopimuslausekkeet EU:n Yleisen tietosuoja-asetuksen (GDPR) artiklan 46(2) mukaisesti.Lisätietoa henkilötietojesi suojaukseen käytettävistä keinoista saat ottamalla meihin yhteyttä tämän Tietosuojalausunnon lopussa annettuja yhteystietoja käyttäen.</p>
<p>8.    <b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Olemme sitoutuneet suojelemaan henkilötietojesi turvallisuutta.
Käytämme erilaisia tietoturvatekniikoita ja -menettelyjä henkilötietojesi suojaamiseen luvattomalta pääsyltä, käytöltä tai paljastumiselta mukaan lukien tällaisten turvatoimien käyttöönotto sovellettavan lain mahdollisesti vaatimalla tavalla.
Mikään tietojärjestelmä ei kuitenkaan ole täysin turvallinen, emmekä me voi tästä syystä taata henkilötietojesi täydellistä suojausta.
Emme myöskään ole vastuussa sellaisten tietojen suojauksesta, joita siirrät Sivustoille hallintamme ulkopuolisten verkkojen, kuten Internetin tai langattomien verkkojen, kautta.</p>
<p>
<br>
Henkilötietojesi suojaus ja turvallisuus on myös sinusta itsestäsi kiinni.Mikäli olet saanut meiltä (tai itse valinnut) käyttäjätunnuksen ja salasanan Sivustojen käyttöä varten, olet itse vastuussa tällaisten kirjautumistietojen luottamuksellisuuden varmistamisesta ja siitä, ettet paljasta niitä muille.</p>
<p>9.    <b>Evästeet ja vastaavat tekniikat, verkkoanalytiikka</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Mikä eväste on? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Evästeet ovat pieniä määriä tietoa sisältäviä tekstitiedostoja, jotka ladataan kiintolevyllesi tai selaimesi muistiin, kun vierailet jollakin Sivustollamme.
Evästeet ovat hyödyllisiä, koska ne auttavat jäsentelemään Sivustojemme sisältöä ja asettelua ja mahdollistavat sellaisten tietokoneiden ja laitteiden tunnistamisen, joilla on jo aiemmin vierailtu Sivustoillamme.
Evästeillä on useita eri tehtäviä.
Ne esimerkiksi sallivat Sivustojemme muistaa asetuksesi ja auttavat meitä parantamaan Sivustojemme käytettävyyttä ja suorituskykyä sekä sinun käyttökokemustasi niissä.</p>
<p>Sivustoissamme voi olla myös Web-majakoina tai yhden kuvapisteen GIF-kuvina tunnettuja sähköisiä kuvia, joiden avulla voimme laskea, montako käyttäjää tietyllä sivulla on vieraillut.
Saatamme lisätä verkkomajakoita markkinointisähköpostiviesteihin tai uutiskirjeisiin selvittääksemme, onko viesti avattu ja onko sen linkkejä napsautettu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Evästeluokat ja muu käyttämämme tähän liittyvä teknologia</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sivustoillamme mahdollisesti olevat evästeet tai muu tähän liittyvä teknologia voidaan jakaa neljään luokkaan: täysin välttämätön, suorituskyky, toiminnallisuus ja profiili sekä mainostus.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Täysin välttämättömät evästeet</b>
</p>
<p>Nämä evästeet ovat tärkeitä, koska ne auttavat sinua liikkumaan Sivustoillamme ja käyttämään niiden toimintoja erityisesti tietoja haettaessa ja tilauksia tehtäessä.
Ilman näitä evästeitä pyytämiäsi palveluita ei voitaisi toimittaa.
Nämä evästeet eivät kerää sinusta tietoja, joita voitaisiin käyttää markkinoinnissa tai muistamaan, missä kaikkialla olet Internetissä käynyt.
Esimerkki täysin välttämättömästä evästeestä on ostoskorieväste, jota käytetään muistamaan tuotteet, jotka asiakas haluaa hankkia, kun asiakas lisää tuotteita ostoskoriin tai siirtyy maksamaan.
sisäänkirjautumis- tai todennuseväste, jonka ansiosta käyttäjä voidaan tunnistaa ja hänet voidaan kirjata sisään sivustoon yhtä vierailua varten.
istuntoeväste, jota tarvitaan tiedonsiirtoon ja sivuston toimintojen tuottamiseen sekä tietoturvaeväste, joka estää toistuvat sisäänkirjausyritykset tai vastaavat sivuston väärinkäyttötavat.
Tämäntyyppisiä evästeitä säilytetään vain niin kauan kuin niitä tarvitaan.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Suorituskykyevästeet</b>
</p>
<p>Nämä evästeet keräävät tietoa siitä, miten käytät Sivustojamme, esimerkiksi millä sivuilla käyt useimmin ja saatko virheviestejä joiltakin sivuilta.
Nämä evästeet keräävät tietoja, joita käytetään Sivustojemme toiminnan parantamiseen.
Ilman näitä evästeitä emme tiedä, miten Sivustomme toimivat, emmekä voi tehdä parannuksia, jotka voivat parantaa selauskokemustasi.
Sivustojemme käyttämiä suorituskykyevästeitä ovat muun muassa Google- ja Adobe Analytics -evästeet (lisätietoa on jäljempänä).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Toiminnallisuus- ja profiilievästeet</b>
</p>
<p>Näiden evästeiden avulla Sivustot voivat tallentaa asiakkaan antamia tietoja, kuten sivuston kielivalinta, ja tallentamaan teknisiä tietoja, joita voi käyttää Sivustojen toiminnassa.
Ne muistavat esimerkiksi käyttäjätunnuksesi ja käyttäjäprofiilisi osat.
Ne myös varmistavat, että sivuston käyttö on mielekästä ja sisältö toivomasi tapaista.
Niitä voidaan käyttää myös sellaisten palveluiden tarjoamiseen, joita olet pyytänyt, kuten videon katselemista tai blogin kommentointia varten (tällöin ei kuitenkaan ole kyse Sivuston toiminnan kannalta täysin välttämättömistä evästeistä – katso luokka 1).
Näiden evästeiden avulla ei seurata selaustapahtumiasi muissa sivustoissa.</p>
<p>Ilman näitä evästeitä sivusto ei voi muistaa aiemmin tehtyjä valintoja tai mukauttaa selauskokemustasi.
Käytämme evästeitä esimerkiksi tallentamaan kielivalintasi, jolloin tuotehaun tulokset esitetään oikealla kielellä, ja tallentamaan Sivustoissamme näkyvän evästetietopalkin ulkoasuun liittyvät valintasi.
Tämän evästeen avulla voimme muistaa evästetietopalkin ulkoasuun liittyvän valintasi, kun vierailet uudelleen sivustossa, jossa teit palkin ulkoasun valinnan, ja muissa Yrityksen sivustoissa, jotka ovat samalla toimialueella tai samalla ylemmän tason toimialueella.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Mainontaevästeet ja vastaavat tekniikat</b>
</p>
<p>Näitä evästeitä tai vastaavia teknologioita voidaan käyttää sinulle kiinnostuksen kohteittesi perusteella relevanttien mainosten esittämiseen.
Niitä voidaan myös käyttää rajoittamaan mainoksen esityskertojen määrää sekä mittaamaan mainostuskampanjan tehokkuutta.
Näiden evästeiden avulla saatetaan seurata vierailuitasi muissa sivustoissa.
Ilman näitä evästeitä tai muuta tähän liittyvää teknologiaa näkemäsi verkkomainokset eivät välttämättä liity sinuun ja mielenkiinnon kohteisiisi.</p>
<p>Sallimme kolmannen osapuolen mainoskumppaneidemme (lisätietoja on jäljempänä) käyttää evästeitä ja muuta teknologiaa verkkosivustojen selaustoimintaasi eri ajankohtina liittyvien tietojen keräämiseksi, kun käytät Sivustojamme, mukaan lukien selaamasi tai ostamasi tuotteet ja sijaintisi.
Esimerkkejä käyttämistämme mainontaevästeistä tai vastaavista teknologioista ovat Google AdWords ja Facebook-pikselit.</p>
<p>
<b>Evästeasetusten määrittäminen <br>
</b>
<br>
Voit tavallisesti muokata selaimesi asetuksia ja kieltäytyä evästeistä.
Voit myös peruuttaa suostumuksesi milloin tahansa muuttamalla selaimesi asetuksia evästeistä kieltäytymiseksi, niiden poistamiseksi tai peruuttamalla tiettyjen evästeiden luvan kerätä tietoa.
Seuraavassa on tietoa tällaisista evästeistä.
Jos hylkäät evästeet kokonaan, et ehkä saa kaikkia Sivustojemme tai muiden käyttämiesi sivustojen toimintoja käyttöösi.</p>
<p>
<b>Verkkoanalytiikan käyttö<br>
<br>
</b>Seuraamme sivustojemme vierailukertoja alan standardien mukaisella verkkoanalytiikalla (”verkkoanalytiikan tuottajat”).
Sivustojemme käyttöä koskevan evästeen luomat tiedot (mukaan lukien IP-osoitteesi) lähetetään ja tallennetaan verkkoanalytiikan tuottajien palvelimille.
Verkkoanalytiikan tuottajamme käyttävät näitä tietoja arvioimaan Sivustojemme käyttöäsi, kokoamaan raportteja sivustojen käytöstä sivuston ylläpitäjälle ja tarjoamaan muita palveluita, jotka liittyvät sivuston tapahtumiin ja Internetin käyttöön (kuten jäljempänä on tarkemmin esitetty).
Verkkoanalytiikan tuottajamme voivat myös siirtää nämä tiedot kolmansille osapuolille, jos laki sitä edellyttää tai kun kyseiset kolmannet osapuolet käsittelevät tietoja kyseisten tahojen puolesta.</p>
<p>Käytämme erilaisia analysointityökaluja, joiden tarkoituksena on mitata, analysoida ja optimoida markkinointitoimenpiteitä ja näyttää sinulle räätälöityjä mainoksia, joiden toivomme olevan mielestäsi erityisen kiinnostavia.
Käytämme erityisesti seuraavia työkaluja:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, palvelun tuottaa Twitter, Inc.
(”Twitter”).
Twitter kerää käyttötietoja suoraan Sivustosta integroimalla mainosteknologiansa sivustoon.
Tällaisia tietoja ovat selaimen evästetunnukset, mobiililaitteiden laitetunnukset, salakirjoitetut sähköpostiosoitteet, väestöryhmätiedot tai kiinnostuksen kohteet ja sisältö, jota Sivustoissa on tarkasteltu.
Voit kieltäytyä Twitter-mainonnasta seuraamalla alla olevaa linkkiä:</li>

<b>Google Analytics ja DoubleClick Floodlight</b>.
molemmat palvelut tuottaa Google Inc.
(”Google”): Google Analytics käyttää evästeitä, joiden avulla Sivustojen käyttöä voidaan analysoida.
Kerätyt tiedot (IP-osoite, selaustiedot ja muut käyttäjän Sivustojen käyttöön liittyvät tiedot, esim.
sen sivuston tiedot jolta Sivustoon siirrytään, verkkoselaimen tyyppi ja käyttöjärjestelmä, ulkoisille sivuille johtavien linkkien napsautukset, vuorovaikutus sivustokohtaisilla widgeteillä) siirretään yleensä Googlen palvelimille Yhdysvalloissa ja tallennetaan sinne.
Olemme kuitenkin ottaneet portaalissa käyttöön IP-osoitteen anonymisoinnin, joten Google supistaa IP-osoitteen siten, että käyttäjän voidaan havaita olevan ainoastaan Euroopan unionin tai Euroopan talousalueen jäsenvaltioissa (jos selaat sivustoa EU/ETA-alueella) ilman sen tarkempaa mahdollisuutta sijaintitiedon selvittämiseen.
Täydellinen IP-osoite lähetetään vain poikkeustapauksissa Googlen palvelimille Yhdysvalloissa siellä lyhennettäväksi.
Googlen mukaan selaimesi lähettämä IP-osoite ei sekoitu muihin Google-tietoihin, kun IP-osoite on peräisin Google Analyticsin ympäristöstä.
Voit kieltäytyä Google Analytics -seurannasta seuraamalla alla olevaa linkkiä:</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Analytics -kieltäytymislinkki</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> on työkalu digitaalisen mainonnan hallintaan.
<b>Floodlight</b>tallentaa konversiotietoja ja raportoi niistä – verkkosivuston käyttäjien toiminnasta, kun he ovat nähneet tai napsauttaneet mainosta – ja perustaa kohderyhmiä markkinointitoimenpiteiden ja kampanjoiden optimoimiseksi.
Voit kieltäytyä näistä palveluista muuttamalla selaimesi asetuksia yllä kuvatulla tavalla.</p>
<p>·         Lisäksi Sivustoissamme käytetään <b>Google Tag Manager</b> -työkalua, joka auttaa hallitsemaan verkkosivustojen tunnisteita yhdessä käyttöliittymässä.
Työkalun toiminta (tunnisteiden toteuttaminen) käynnistää muita tunnisteita, jotka voivat itse kerätä (myös henkilökohtaisia) tietoja.
Google Tag Manager ei kuitenkaan käytä näitä tietoja.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>SessionCam</b> – sivustoillamme kävijöiden liikkumisesta luodaan SessionCam-tallenteita heidän kokemiensa käytettävyysongelmien tunnistamiseksi.
SessionCam-ohjelmiston kävijöistä keräämät tiedot ovat anonyymejä eikä niihin sisälly tietoja, joista henkilö voidaan tunnistaa.
Tämän osana SessionCam tallentaa hiiren liikkeet, napsautukset, kosketusnäyttöeleet, lomakesyötteet ja vierityksen.
Lisätietoja siitä, miten SessionCam käyttää evästeitä, saa lukemalla SessionCamin tietosuojakäytännön.
Yksittäinen käyttäjä voi valita, ettei SessionCam tallenna mitään hänen anonyymiä sivustokäyttäytymistään. Valinta voidaan tehdä napsauttamalla täältä: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
Käyttäjä siirtyy SessionCam-sivuston sivulle, jossa hän voi sammuttaa SessionCam-tallennuksen napsauttamalla yhtä painiketta.
Jos käyttäjä valitsee tämän, hänen selaimelleen asetetaan eväste, joka osoittaa SessionCamille, ettei hänen laitteellaan sivustolle tehtyjä käyntejä tallenneta.
Tämän palvelun keräämiä tietoja käytetään sivuston käytettävyyden parantamiseen.
Kerätyt tiedot tallennetaan ja niitä käytetään kokonais- ja tilastoraportointiin ja arviointiin sivustojemme toimivuuden parantamiseksi kävijöiden kannalta.<i>

<b>Rollworks by NextRoll</b> - Kun kävijä tulee sivustollemme, sivusto käyttää kolmannen osapuolen työkaluja (kuten RollWorks) ja voi asettaa kävijöiden selaimiin evästeitä kohdennettua mainontaa varten.
Toimitamme näiden tietojen avulla sivustomme selauskokemukseen kuuluvaa mainontaa.
Kerättyjä tietoja voivat olla muun muassa sivuston käyttö, IP-osoitteet ja evästetunnukset.
Kävijän tulee huomata, että hän näkee mainoksia, vaikka estäisikin palvelun, mutta RollWorks ei silloin henkilökohtaista niitä.

<p>·         Sivustoilla käytetään myös Adobe Inc.:n (”Adobe”) palveluja, erityisesti <b>Adobe Audience Manager</b> -tietohallinta-alustaa.
Se auttaa meitä tunnistamaan yksilöiviä yleisöprofiileja, jotta tiedämme arvokkaimmat markkinointisegmenttimme.
Toinen käytettävä palvelu on <b>Adobe Analytics</b>, jonka avulla voimme analysoida verkkosivustomme käyttöä sen suunnittelun ja käytettävyyden optimoimiseksi ja mukauttamiseksi verkkosivuillamme vierailijoiden tarpeita varten.
Tätä varten Adobe Analytics kerää henkilötietoja, kuten IP-osoitteesi ja muita tunnistetietoja, käyttötietoja, sähköpostiosoitteita ja sijaintitietoja.
Voit kieltää Adobe Analytics -palvelun käytön kohdallasi seuraamalla alla olevaa linkkiä:</p>

<p>·         Sivustoilla käytetään <b>Facebook Custom Audience</b> -toimintoa, jonka tuottaa Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.
Palvelu on uudelleenmarkkinointipalvelu, jonka avulla voimme viestiä sivustojemme kävijöille Facebookin välityksellä esittämällä mainoksiamme.
Henkilökohtaistettu mainonta perustuu analyysiin, joka tuotetaan Sivustojemme evästeillä ja vastaavilla tekniikoilla kuten seurantapikseleillä.
Tekniikoiden avulla voimme tunnistaa asiakkaat, jotka lopulta konvertoituvat markkinointiliideiksi Facebook.com-sivustossa esitetyistä mainoskampanjoista.
Tämä auttaa meitä mittaamaan markkinointikampanjoidemme tehokkuutta.
Palvelun avulla voimme myös seurata verkkosivujen toimintaa ja tunnistaa selvästi erottuvia ryhmiä, joille voimme kohdistaa tarkemmin heille suunnattuja viestejä Sivustoilla vierailujen perusteella.
Emme kerää henkilötietoja tällä tavalla, ellet itse päätä antaa niitä meille täyttämällä lomakkeen tai ottamalla meihin yhteyttä muulla tavalla.</p>
<p>Lisätietoja Facebookin tietosuoja-asetuksista ja vaihtoehdoista niiden muuttamiseksi saat napsauttamalla seuraavaa linkkiä:</p>

<p>·         Sivustoilla käytetään myös LinkedIn, Corp.:n tarjoamia verkkomarkkinointi- ja seurantapalveluita, erityisesti <b>LinkedIn-mainoksia</b> ja <b>LinkedIn-analytiikkaa.
</b>Molemmat palvelut keräävät ja käsittelevät käyttö- ja vuorovaikutustietoja, yhteystietoja, IP-osoitteita ja sijaintitietoja.
Käytämme LinkedIn-mainoksia ohjaamaan liikennettä Sivustoon näyttämällä verkkomainoksia osoitteessa LinkedIn.com siinä toivossa, että käyttäjät seuraavat mainoksia Sivustoihin.
Käytämme LinkedIn-analytiikkaa mainoskampanjoidemme onnistumisen mittaamiseksi, jotta voimme nähdä, kenet käyttäjistä lopulta konvertoituvat markkinointiliideiksi Sivustoilla.
Emme kerää henkilötietoja tällä tavalla, ellet itse päätä antaa niitä meille täyttämällä lomakkeen tai ottamalla meihin yhteyttä muulla tavalla.</p>

<p>·         Sivustoissa käytetään myös markkinointipalvelua nimeltä <b>AddThis</b>, jonka tuottaa Oracle America, Inc., sekä käyttäjän sitoutumismittaustyökalua nimeltä <b>Marketo</b>, jonka tuottaa Marketo Inc.
AddThis on Sivustoissa käytettävä yhteisöpalvelutyökalu, jota käytetään uutisartikkeleissamme ja jonka avulla artikkeleita voidaan jakaa sosiaalisessa mediassa.
Se voi kerätä Sivustoissa tietoja evästeen avulla, jotta voimme parantaa palveluitamme ja kohdistaa mainontaa.
AddThis-palvelun käsittelemät tiedot sisältävät yksilöiviä tunnisteita (esim.
evästetunnuksen), IP-osoitteen, maantieteellisen sijainnin, laitetietoja, kuten selaimen ja laitteen tyypin, käyttöjärjestelmän ja ensisijaisen kielivalinnan, Sivustolla käynnin päivämäärän ja kellonajan sekä URL-osoitteen, josta saavuit Sivustoon.</p>
<p>Voit kieltäytyä AddThis-sisällöstä napsauttamalla seuraavaa linkkiä:</p>
<p>AddThis-kieltäytymislinkki</p>
<p>Marketo-evästeitä käytetään mittaamaan käyttäjien vuorovaikutusta Sivustoissa ja online-tapahtumissa sekä mainosten ja verkkosisällön kuten asiantuntijaraporttien latausten seuraamiseksi.
Evästeen avulla käyttäjä voidaan yhdistää sähköpostin vastaanottajaan markkinointikampanjan tehokkuuden mittaamiseksi.
Kerättyjä henkilötietoja voivat olla seuraavat: verkkovierailun ajankohta, selatut sivut, sen sivuston tiedot jolta Sivustoon siirryttiin, verkkoselaimen tyyppi ja käyttöjärjestelmä, vuorovaikutus sivustossa, verkon sijainti, IP-osoite, ladatut asiakirjat, ulkoisiin verkkosivustoihin johtavien linkkien napsautukset.

<b>Qu’est-ce qu’un cookie ? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Les cookies sont des fichiers texte contenant de petites quantités d’information qui sont téléchargées sur votre disque dur ou stockées dans la mémoire de votre navigateur lorsque vous accédez à l’un de nos Sites.
Les cookies sont très pratiques, car ils permettent d’organiser le contenu et la mise en page de nos Sites, et nous permettent de reconnaître les ordinateurs ou les appareils qui ont déjà eu accès à nos Sites.
Les cookies ont de nombreuses utilités, comme enregistrer vos préférences et paramètres personnels en fonction des Sites, nous aider à améliorer le confort d’utilisation et les performances de nos Sites et rendre ceux-ci plus agréables.</p>
<p>Nos Sites peuvent également contenir des images électroniques appelées balises Web (ou gif d’un pixel) qui nous permettent de compter le nombre d’utilisateurs ayant visité ces pages spécifiques.
Il est également possible que nous intégrions ces balises Web à des courriers électroniques à caractère promotionnel ou à des bulletins d’information afin de savoir si vous avez ouvert ces messages ou effectué une action quelconque.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Catégories de cookies et technologies similaires que nous utilisons</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Les types de cookies ou les technologies similaires utilisés sur nos Sites peuvent être classés en quatre catégories : Absolument indispensables, Performance, Fonctionnalité et Profil &amp.
Publicité.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Cookies Absolument indispensables</b>
</p>
<p>Ces cookies sont essentiels pour les fonctionnalités de base du Site, car ils vous permettent de vous déplacer sur nos Sites et d’utiliser les fonctionnalités, notamment en ce qui concerne les recherches d’informations et l’envoi de commandes.
Sans ces cookies, nous ne pourrions pas vous offrir les services que vous nous demandez.
Ces cookies ne recueillent pas d’informations vous concernant susceptibles d’être utilisées à des fins de marketing ou pour enregistrer votre parcours sur Internet.
Des exemples de cookies strictement nécessaires sont un « cookie de panier » qui est utilisé pour se rappeler des produits que vous souhaitez acheter lorsque vous ajoutez des produits à votre panier ou lorsque vous vous déconnectez, un cookie de connexion/authentification qui permet et gère votre connexion au Site et vous identifie après vous être connecté pour une session unique, un cookie de session qui est nécessaire pour effectuer la transmission de données et vous fournir le Site, un cookie de sécurité qui détecte la répétition des tentatives de connexion échouées ou des abus similaires des Sites.
Ces types de cookies sont normalement stockés uniquement dans la mesure nécessaire à leur usage.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Cookies de performance</b>
</p>
<p>Ces cookies recueillent des informations sur l’usage que vous faites de nos Sites, par exemple : quelles pages consultez-vous, recevez-vous des messages d’erreurs sur certaines pages et, si oui, lesquelles.
Ces cookies n’enregistrent que des informations anonymes servant à améliorer le fonctionnement de nos Sites.
Sans eux, nous ne pouvons pas savoir comment nos Sites fonctionnent ni apporter les améliorations pertinentes pour vous rendre la navigation plus agréable.
Parmi les cookies de performance utilisés sur nos Sites, on peut citer les cookies de Google et Adobe Analytics (plus d’informations à leur sujet ci-dessous).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Cookies de fonctionnalités et de profilage</b>
</p>
<p>Ces cookies permettent à nos Sites de stocker des informations que vous fournissez, par exemple vos préférences, et également de stocker des informations techniques utiles à vos interactions avec nos Sites.
Par exemple, ils peuvent stocker votre identifiant utilisateur et d’autres éléments de votre profil utilisateur.
Ils s’assurent également que votre expérience en utilisant les Sites est pertinente pour vous.
Ils peuvent également être utilisés pour fournir des services que vous avez demandés, comme regarder une vidéo ou commenter un blog (sans être un cookie qui est strictement nécessaire pour que le Site fonctionne, voir la catégorie 1).
Ces cookies ne seront pas utilisés pour suivre votre activité de navigation sur d’autres sites.</p>
<p>Sans ces cookies, un site Web ne peut pas se souvenir des choix que vous aviez faits lors de visites précédentes, ni personnaliser le site pour vous.
Par exemple, nous utilisons un cookie pour stocker vos préférences linguistiques, ce qui nous permet de vous présenter les résultats de la recherche de produits dans votre langue.
Nous utilisons également un cookie pour stocker votre choix quant à l’affichage de la bannière d’information sur les cookies qui apparaît sur nos Sites.
Ce cookie nous permet de nous souvenir de ce choix lorsque vous revenez plus tard sur le même site ou sur n’importe quel site d’une Société du même domaine ou du même domaine parent.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Cookies publicitaires et technologies similaires</b>
</p>
<p>Ces cookies ou technologies similaires peuvent être utilisés pour vous envoyer des publicités qui sont plus pertinentes quant à vos centres d’intérêt.
Ils peuvent également servir à limiter le nombre de fois que vous voyez une publicité et à mesurer l’efficacité d’une campagne publicitaire.
Ces cookies peuvent suivre vos visites sur d’autres sites.
Sans ces cookies et autres technologies, les annonces publicitaires en ligne qui vous sont proposées seront moins pertinentes pour vous par rapport à vos centres d’intérêt.</p>
<p>Nous autorisons nos partenaires publicitaires tiers (voir ci-dessous) à utiliser des cookies ainsi que d’autres technologies pour collecter des informations sur vos activités de navigation au fil du temps et sur différents sites Web lorsque vous utilisez nos Sites, cela inclut les produits que vous sélectionnez ou achetez, ainsi que votre emplacement.
Parmi les cookies publicitaires ou technologies similaires que nous utilisons, on peut citer Google AdWords et Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Configuration de vos préférences pour les cookies<br>
</b>
<br>
Vous pouvez généralement modifier les paramètres de votre navigateur pour refuser les cookies et vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre navigateur pour que celui-ci refuse ou désactive les cookies, ou en désactivant des cookies spécifiques avec les options de désactivation mentionnées ci-dessous.
Si vous désactivez entièrement l’enregistrement des cookies, vous risquez de ne pas bénéficier de l’ensemble des fonctionnalités des Sites que vous visitez.</p>
<p>
<b>Notre utilisation des technologies d’analyse d’audience<br>
<br>
</b>Nous utilisons des analyses d’audience standard pour suivre les visites effectuées sur nos sites (« Fournisseurs de statistiques Web »).
Les informations générées par le cookie concernant votre utilisation de nos Sites (y compris votre adresse IP) seront transmises et stockées par nos Fournisseurs de statistiques Web sur leurs serveurs.
Les Fournisseurs de statistiques Web utiliseront ces informations à des fins d’évaluation de votre utilisation de nos Sites, en créant des rapports sur l’activité sur le site Web destinés aux opérateurs du site Web et en fournissant d’autres services relatifs à l’activité sur le site Web et à l’utilisation d’Internet (comme indiqué ci-dessous).
Les Fournisseurs de statistiques Web peuvent aussi transférer ces informations à des tiers lorsque la loi leur permet ou lorsque ces tiers traitent ces informations pour leur propre compte.</p>
<p>Nous utilisons différents outils d’analyses qui servent à mesurer, analyser et optimiser nos mesures de marketing et à vous fournir des publicités personnalisées qui pourraient vous intéresser particulièrement.
En particulier, nous utilisons les outils suivants :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, service de Twitter, Inc.
(« Twitter »).
Twitter recueille des informations directement à partir de l’utilisation des Sites en intégrant sa technologie publicitaire.
Ces informations comprennent les ID de cookie du navigateur, les ID d’appareils mobiles, les adresses e-mail cryptées, les données démographiques ou d’intérêt, ainsi que le contenu visualisé ou les actions prises sur les Sites.

<b>Google Analytics et DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, deux services de Google Inc.
(« Google ») : Google Analytics utilise des cookies qui permettent une analyse de votre utilisation des Sites.
Les informations collectées (adresse IP, activités de navigation et autres données liées à votre utilisation des Sites, par exemple, les détails du site de référence, le type de navigateur Web et le système d’exploitation, les clics sur les liens externes, l’interaction avec les widgets spécifiques au site) sont généralement transférées et stockées sur un serveur Google aux États-Unis.
Cependant, en raison de l’anonymisation IP que nous avons activée sur le portail, Google réduira au préalable votre adresse IP aux États membres de l’Union européenne/de l’espace économique européen (si vous naviguez sur le Site dans l’UE/EEE).
Ce n’est que dans des cas exceptionnels que l’adresse IP complète sera transmise à un serveur Google aux États-Unis et raccourcie là-bas.
Selon Google, l’adresse IP transmise par votre navigateur dans le cadre de Google Analytics ne sera pas fusionnée avec d’autres données Google.
Vous pouvez désactiver Google Analytics en suivant le lien ci-dessous :</li>
</ul>

<b>DoubleClick</b> est un outil de gestion de la publicité numérique.
<b>Floodlight</b> capture et génère des rapports sur les conversions – les activités des utilisateurs du site Web après avoir vu ou cliqué sur une publicité – et configure des publics cibles afin d’optimiser les actions et les campagnes de marketing.
Vous pouvez le désactiver en modifiant les paramètres de votre navigateur, comme décrit ci-dessus.</p>
<p>·         En outre, nos Sites utilisent <b>Google Tag Manager</b> par Google, qui permet de gérer les balises du site Web via une interface unique.
L’outil lui-même (mettant en œuvre les balises) déclenche d’autres balises qui peuvent collecter elles-mêmes des données (personnelles).
Cependant, Google Tag Manager n’accède pas à ces données.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>SessionCam</b> - nos sites utilisent SessionCam pour créer des enregistrements de la navigation des visiteurs sur le site Web afin d’identifier les problèmes d’ergonomie rencontrés par nos visiteurs.

L’affichage de la publicité personnalisée est basé sur une analyse de l’utilisation de nos Sites à l’aide de cookies et de technologies comparables, telles que le suivi des pixels, qui nous permet d’identifier les clients qui deviennent finalement des prospects à partir d’une campagne Facebook.com.
Cela nous aide à prouver l’efficacité de nos campagnes de marketing.
De plus, le service nous permet de surveiller l’activité du site Web afin de créer des publics pour que nous puissions les cibler de nouveau en fonction de leur visite sur les Sites.
Nous ne connaîtrons pas de données personnelles dans ce contexte tant que vous n’aurez pas choisi de les fournir en remplissant un formulaire ou en nous contactant d’une autre manière.</p>

<p>·         Les Sites utilisent également des services de marketing et de suivi en ligne offerts par LinkedIn, Corp., en particulier <b>LinkedIn Ads</b> et <b>LinkedIn Analytics.
</b>Les deux services recueillent et traitent les données d’utilisation et d’interaction, les informations de contact, l’adresse IP et les données de localisation.
Nous utilisons LinkedIn Ads pour diriger le trafic vers les Sites en publiant des publicités en ligne sur LinkedIn.com qui peut à terme conduire les utilisateurs vers les Sites.
Nous utilisons LinkedIn Analytics pour mesurer le succès de nos campagnes publicitaires afin que nous puissions voir quels utilisateurs deviennent finalement des prospects sur les Sites.

 <b>Protection contre le pistage</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Certains navigateurs Web peuvent envoyer des signaux contre le pistage aux sites avec lesquels l’utilisateur communique.Comme l’intégration et l’activation de cette fonction diffèrent d’un navigateur à l’autre, il peut être difficile de déterminer si l’utilisateur permet sciemment la transmission de ces signaux ou s’il a conscience de l’existence d’un tel mécanisme.Nous ne répondons actuellement pas à ces signaux.</p>

</p>
<p>·       <b>Recherche et analyse.</b> Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses afin de nous aider à examiner vos préférences d’achat, à déterminer les produits et services qui répondent le mieux à vos besoins et à mesurer l’efficacité de la publicité que nous vous présentons.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Application de la loi: </b>Nous pouvons utiliser les renseignements personnels que nous recueillons afin de détecter, de prévenir et de combattre la fraude, l’utilisation abusive de nos sites et la violation de la propriété intellectuelle, de nos conditions générales et des lois.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>3.    <b>Fondement juridique selon lequel nous traitons les renseignements</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Lorsque la loi l’exige, nous nous assurons qu’il existe un fondement juridique pour le traitement de vos renseignements personnels.
Dans la plupart des cas, le fondement juridique sera le suivant :</p>
<p>·       le traitement est nécessaire pour l’exécution des services que nous vous fournissons;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       le traitement est nécessaire pour nous conformer à nos obligations légales, y compris le respect des lois, des règlements, des demandes gouvernementales et quasi gouvernementales, des ordonnances ou des citations à comparaître applicables; <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       le traitement est fondé sur votre consentement au traitement de vos renseignements personnels à une ou plusieurs fins précisées (par exemple, à des fins de marketing); <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       le traitement est nécessaire pour répondre à nos intérêts légitimes, par exemple pour développer et améliorer nos sites, nos produits ou nos services au profit de nos clients. </p>
<p>4.    <b>Anonymisation des renseignements</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Conformément à la loi applicable, nous pouvons anonymiser vos renseignements personnels afin qu’ils ne puissent plus être utilisés pour vous identifier.Les renseignements anonymisés ne sont pas considérés comme des renseignements personnels.
ils ne sont donc pas assujettis à cet énoncé de confidentialité.Nous pouvons recueillir, utiliser et partager des renseignements anonymisés à n’importe quelle fin.</p>
<p>5.    <b>Durée de conservation des renseignements</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
La période durant laquelle nous conservons vos renseignements personnels varie en fonction de l’objectif de traitement.Par exemple, nous conservons les renseignements personnels nécessaires pour vous fournir des produits et des services ou pour faciliter les transactions que vous avez demandées aussi longtemps que vous êtes un client de la Société.Conformément à la loi applicable, nous conservons vos renseignements personnels à des fins de marketing jusqu’à ce que vous vous désabonniez des communications de marketing direct.Si vous soumettez une demande d’emploi sur nos sites, nous conserverons les détails de votre demande comme l’indique l’énoncé de confidentialité ou tout autre avis mis à votre disposition dans le cadre de votre demande ou comme la loi l’exige.Dans tous les autres cas, nous conservons vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que nécessaire aux fins décrites dans cet énoncé de confidentialité, après quoi ils sont anonymisés (lorsque la loi applicable le permet), supprimés ou détruits.</p>
<p>6.    <b>Divulgation des renseignements</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers sélectionnés conformément à la loi applicable, y compris comme indiqué ci-dessous.</p>
<p>·       <b>Les sociétés de notre groupe. </b>Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec nos sociétés affiliées et les sociétés de notre groupe comme raisonnablement nécessaire aux fins décrites dans le présent énoncé de confidentialité.<br>

Nous exigeons que ces fournisseurs de services protègent la confidentialité de vos renseignements personnels. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Distributeurs et autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance. </b>Nous pourrions partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers qui distribuent nos produits et avec d’autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance à des fins comprenant la possibilité que ces tiers communiquent avec vous à des fins de marketing.<br>

<p>·       <b>Divulgation relative aux acquisitions ou aux cessions. </b>Dans certaines circonstances, il est possible que la Société décide, pour des questions stratégiques ou d’autres raisons professionnelles, de vendre, d’acheter, de fusionner ou de réorganiser autrement les activités dans certains pays ou de se départir de ces activités.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Divulgation pour d’autres motifs. </b>Nous pouvons divulguer des renseignements personnels si la loi l’exige ou l’autorise ou si nous jugeons en toute bonne foi qu’une telle action est nécessaire pour nous conformer à des obligations légales ou à des recours en droit exercés à notre égard, pour protéger et défendre nos droits et nos biens, ou dans des circonstances urgentes de protection de la sécurité personnelle de tout individu.</p>

<br>
<b>Utilisateurs résidant dans l’Espace économique européen (EEE)</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Au besoin, nous avons instauré des mécanismes de protection appropriés avec les sociétés de notre groupe, nos fournisseurs de service, nos entrepreneurs, nos distributeurs et nos autres partenaires et agents commerciaux pour garantir que les renseignements personnels transférés à l’extérieur de l’EEE sont adéquatement protégés.Ces protections comprennent généralement les clauses contractuelles types de l’UE conformément à l’article 46(2) du règlement général sur la protection des données.Pour plus de renseignements sur les protections appropriées instaurées afin de protéger vos renseignements personnels, veuillez communiquer avec nous aux coordonnées indiquées à la fin du présent énoncé de confidentialité.</p>
<p>8.    <b>Sécurité</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Nous nous engageons à protéger la sécurité de vos renseignements personnels.<br>
Nous utilisons toute une gamme de technologies et de procédures de sécurité pour protéger vos renseignements personnels contre l’accès, l’utilisation ou la divulgation non autorisés, y compris la mise en place de telles mesures de sécurité comme prescrit par les lois applicables.<br>
Cependant, comme aucun système d’information ne peut être protégé à 100 %, nous ne pouvons garantir la sécurité totale de vos renseignements personnels.
De plus, nous ne sommes pas responsables de la sécurité des renseignements que vous transmettez à des sites au moyen de réseaux que nous ne contrôlons pas, y compris l’Internet et les réseaux sans fil.</p>
<p>
<br>
La protection et la sécurité de vos renseignements personnels relèvent également de votre responsabilité.Vous avez la responsabilité de préserver la confidentialité de l’identifiant d’utilisateur et du mot de passe servant à accéder à nos sites que nous vous fournissons ou que vous avez choisis et de ne pas les révéler à autrui.</p>
<p>9.    <b>Témoins et technologies similaires.
analyse Web</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Qu’est-ce qu’un témoin? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Les témoins sont des fichiers texte contenant de petites quantités de données, qui sont téléchargés sur votre disque dur ou dans la mémoire de votre navigateur chaque fois que vous consultez l’un de nos sites.
Les témoins sont utiles parce qu’ils nous aident à organiser le contenu et les éléments de la mise en page de nos sites et à reconnaître les ordinateurs et autres appareils s’étant déjà connectés à nos sites.
Les témoins ont une utilité très variée.
Par exemple, ils permettent à nos sites de garder en mémoire le réglage de vos préférences et nous aident à améliorer la convivialité, le rendement et l’expérience d’utilisation de nos sites.</p>
<p>Nos sites peuvent également contenir des images électroniques connues sous le nom de pixels invisibles (parfois aussi appelés GIF invisibles) qui nous permettent de compter le nombre d’utilisateurs qui consultent des pages précises.
Nous pouvons également inclure des pixels invisibles dans les courriels promotionnels ou bulletins d’information afin de déterminer si les messages ont été ouverts et s’ils ont fait l’objet d’une action.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Catégories de témoins et de technologies semblables que nous utilisons</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Les types de témoins ou de technologies semblables que nous utilisons sur nos sites font partie de l’une des quatre catégories suivantes : Stricte nécessité, Performance, Fonctionnalité et profil, et Publicité.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Témoins strictement nécessaires</b>
</p>
<p>Ces témoins sont essentiels pour les fonctionnalités de base du site, car ils vous permettent de parcourir nos sites et d’utiliser leurs fonctionnalités, particulièrement en ce qui concerne les recherches d’information et l’exécution des commandes de produits.
Sans ces témoins, il est impossible de vous fournir les services que vous demandez.
Ces témoins ne recueillent aucun renseignement à votre sujet pouvant servir à des campagnes de marketing et ils ne conservent aucune trace de ce que vous faites sur Internet.
Exemples de témoins strictement nécessaires : témoins d’un panier d’achats, utilisés pour se rappeler les produits que vous voulez acheter lorsque vous ajoutez des produits à votre panier d’achats ou passez à la caisse.
témoins de connexion et d’authentification, utilisés pour permettre et gérer votre accès au site après votre connexion de session.
témoins de session, utilisés pour transmettre les données et vous présenter le site.
témoins de sécurité, utilisés pour détecter les échecs de connexion ou d’autres abus similaires des sites.
Ces types de témoins sont stockés régulièrement, mais seulement aussi longtemps que nécessaire à leur usage.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Témoins de performance</b>
</p>
<p>Ces témoins recueillent des informations sur la façon dont vous utilisez nos sites, comme les pages que vous visitez le plus souvent et les messages d’erreur reçus sur certaines pages, le cas échéant.
Ils recueillent des renseignements qui servent à améliorer le fonctionnement de nos sites.
Sans ces témoins, nous ne pouvons pas évaluer le rendement de nos sites ni apporter des améliorations dans le but de vous offrir une meilleure expérience de navigation.
Les exemples de témoins de performance qu’utilisent nos sites comprennent les témoins de Google et d’Adobe Analytics (voir la discussion ci-dessous).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Témoins de fonctionnalité et de profil</b>
</p>
<p>Ces témoins permettent à nos sites de stocker certains renseignements que vous fournissez, comme vos préférences, de même que des données techniques utiles pour l’utilisation de nos sites.
Par exemple, ils peuvent conserver votre identifiant d’utilisateur et des éléments de votre profil d’utilisateur.
Ils s’assurent également que votre expérience d’utilisation des sites sera pertinente pour vous.
Ils peuvent également servir à fournir des services que vous avez demandés, comme regarder une vidéo ou commenter un blogue (sans être un témoin strictement nécessaire au fonctionnement du site, voir la catégorie 1).
Ces témoins ne seront pas utilisés pour faire le suivi de vos activités de navigation sur d’autres sites Web.</p>
<p>Sans ces témoins, il est impossible pour un site Web de garder en mémoire les choix que vous avez faits auparavant ou de personnaliser votre expérience de navigation.
Ce type de témoin nous sert, par exemple, à conserver votre langue de préférence pour que nous puissions vous présenter des résultats de recherche dans la langue appropriée.
Il nous sert également à conserver vos préférences concernant l’apparence de la bannière d’information sur les témoins que nous affichons sur nos sites.
Ces témoins mémorisent votre choix concernant l’apparence d’une bannière de ce genre, et vous n’aurez plus à refaire ce choix lors de votre prochaine visite du même site ni de n’importe quel autre site de la Société appartenant au même domaine ou au même domaine de premier niveau.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Témoins de publicité et technologies semblables</b>
</p>
<p>Ces témoins ou technologies semblables peuvent être utilisés pour diffuser des publicités plus pertinentes pour vous en fonction de vos intérêts.
Ils peuvent également permettre de limiter la récurrence d’une publicité et de mesurer l’efficacité d’une campagne publicitaire.
Ces témoins peuvent faire le suivi de vos visites vers d’autres sites Web.
Sans ces témoins ou technologies semblables, la publicité en ligne que vous voyez serait moins pertinente et moins adaptée à vos champs d’intérêt.</p>
<p>Nous permettons à des partenaires publicitaires tiers (voir ci-dessous) d’utiliser des témoins et d’autres technologies pour recueillir des renseignements sur vos activités de navigation au fil du temps et sur différents sites Web lorsque vous utilisez nos sites, y compris sur les produits que vous consultez ou achetez et sur votre emplacement.
Exemples de témoins publicitaires ou de technologies semblables que nous utilisons : Google AdWords et Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Réglage de vos préférences en matière de témoins<br>
</b>
<br>
Vous pouvez modifier les paramètres de votre navigateur pour refuser les témoins et vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment en modifiant les paramètres de votre navigateur afin de refuser ou de désactiver les témoins, ou en vous désabonnant de certains témoins au moyen des options de désabonnement partagées ci-dessous.
Si vous choisissez de refuser tous les témoins, il se peut que vous ne puissiez pas bénéficier entièrement des fonctions des sites que vous consultez.</p>
<p>
<b>Notre utilisation des analyses Web<br>
<br>
</b>Nous utilisons des outils d’analyse Web standard pour comptabiliser les visites sur nos sites (« fournisseurs d’analyses Web »).
Les renseignements sur votre utilisation de nos sites produits par les témoins (y compris votre adresse IP) sont transmis à nos fournisseurs d’analyses Web et stockés sur leurs serveurs.
Les fournisseurs d’analyses Web utilisent ces renseignements pour évaluer votre utilisation de nos sites, pour produire des rapports d’activité des sites Web destinés à leurs exploitants et pour fournir d’autres services liés à l’activité des sites Web et à l’utilisation d’Internet en général (comme décrit ci-dessous).
Les fournisseurs d’analyses Web peuvent également transférer ces données à des tiers si la loi les y oblige ou dans le cas où des tiers mandatés par ces fournisseurs traitent ces données.</p>
<p>Nous utilisons différents outils d’analyse qui servent à mesurer, à analyser et à optimiser nos mesures de marketing ainsi qu’à vous fournir des publicités personnalisées en fonction de vos intérêts.
Plus particulièrement, nous utilisons les outils suivants :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, service de Twitter, Inc.
(« Twitter »).
Twitter recueille des informations directement à partir de l’utilisation des sites en intégrant sa technologie de publicité.
Ces renseignements comprennent les identifiants de témoin, les identifiants d’appareils mobiles, les adresses de courriel hachées, les données démographiques ou d’intérêt, ainsi que le contenu consulté ou les actions prises sur les sites.
Vous pouvez vous désabonner de Twitter Advertising en suivant le lien ci-dessous :</li>

<p>Lien de désabonnement de Twitter Advertising</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Google Analytics et DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, deux services de Google Inc.
(« Google ») : Google Analytics utilise des témoins qui permettent une analyse de votre utilisation des sites.
Les renseignements recueillis (adresse IP, activités de navigation et autres données liées à votre utilisation des sites, p. ex., les détails du site de départ, le type de navigateur et du système d’exploitation, les clics sur les liens externes, l’interaction avec les widgets du site) sont généralement transférés à un serveur Google aux États-Unis et stockés à cet endroit.
Toutefois, en raison de l’anonymisation des adresses IP que nous avons activée sur le portail, Google réduira au préalable votre adresse IP au sein des États membres de l’Union européenne/de l’espace économique européen (si vous naviguez sur le site dans l’UE/l’EEE).
Ce n’est que dans des cas exceptionnels que l’adresse IP complète sera transmise à un serveur Google aux États-Unis et raccourcie à ce moment.
Selon Google, l’adresse IP transmise par votre navigateur dans le cadre de Google Analytics ne sera pas fusionnée avec les autres données de Google.
Vous pouvez vous désabonner de Google Analytics en suivant le lien ci-dessous :</li>
</ul>
<p>Lien de désabonnement Google Analytics</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> est un outil de gestion de la publicité numérique.
<b>Floodlight</b> capte et signale les conversions (activités des utilisateurs du site Web lorsqu’ils ont consulté ou interagi avec une publicité) et définit des publics cibles afin d’optimiser les mesures et les campagnes de marketing.
Vous pouvez vous désabonner en modifiant les paramètres de votre navigateur, comme décrit ci-dessus.</p>
<p>·         De plus, nos sites utilisent <b>Google Tag Manager</b> par Google, ce qui nous permet de gérer des balises des sites Web à l’aide d’une seule interface.
L’outil lui-même (la mise en œuvre des balises) déclenche d’autres balises qui pourraient collecter des données (personnelles).
Toutefois, Google Tag Manager n’accède pas à ces données.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>Session Cam</b> : nos sites utilisent la SessionCam pour générer l’historique de navigation des visiteurs du site afin d’identifier les problèmes de convivialité qu’ils rencontrent.
Les informations de visiteurs collectées par SessionCam sont anonymes et ne contiennent pas de renseignements permettant d’identifier une personne.
Dans ce cadre, SessionCam enregistre les mouvements de la souris, les clics, les gestes mobiles, l’entrée de formulaire, le défilement.
Pour en savoir plus sur l’utilisation des témoins par Session Cam, consultez la Politique de confidentialité de SessionCam.
En tant qu’utilisateur, vous pouvez choisir de ne pas faire enregistrer toutes vos activités anonymes sur le site Web par SessionCam. Pour ce faire, cliquez ici : https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
Vous serez dirigé vers une page du site Web de SessionCam où vous pourrez désactiver l’option d’enregistrement par SessionCam en cliquant sur une seule touche.
Si vous choisissez de le faire, un témoin est placé sur votre navigateur, qui est ensuite utilisé par SessionCam pour indiquer que les visites effectuées depuis votre appareil ne seront pas enregistrées.
Les données collectées par ce service sont utilisées à des fins d’amélioration de la convivialité de notre site Web.
Les informations recueillies sont mémorisées et utilisées pour des rapports statistiques et agrégés.
Elles sont ensuite évaluées pour améliorer la fonctionnalité de nos sites Web pour nos visiteurs.<i>

Nous utilisons ces données pour fournir de la publicité en rapport avec l’expérience de navigation sur notre site.
Les données collectées peuvent comprendre l’activité du site, les adresses IP et les identifiants de témoins.
Veuillez noter que vous recevrez toujours des publicités même si vous vous désabonnez, mais elles ne seront pas personnalisées par RollWorks.

<p>·         Les sites utilisent également des services d’Adobe Inc.
(« Adobe »), plus particulièrement <b>Adobe Audience Manager</b>, une plateforme de gestion de données qui nous aide à créer des profils de public uniques afin que nous puissions déterminer nos segments les plus précieux, et <b>Adobe Analytics</b>, qui nous permet d’analyser l’utilisation de notre site Web afin d’optimiser sa conception et sa convivialité et de mieux l’adapter aux besoins de nos visiteurs.
À cette fin, Adobe Analytics recueillera des données personnelles, telles que votre adresse IP et d’autres identifiants, les informations relatives à l’utilisation, l’adresse de courriel et les données d’emplacement.

<p>·         Les sites utilisent <b>Facebook Custom audience</b>, un service de remarketing fourni par Facebook Inc.
(1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA) qui nous permet de diriger les visiteurs de nos sites via Facebook avec notre publicité.
L’affichage de la publicité personnalisée repose sur l’analyse de l’utilisation de nos sites à l’aide de témoins et de technologies comparables, comme les pixels-espions, qui nous permettent d’identifier les clients et de les convertir en clients potentiels depuis une campagne sur Facebook.com.
Cela nous permet de valider l’efficacité de nos campagnes de marketing.
De plus, le service nous permet de surveiller l’activité du site Web afin d’accroître notre public et ainsi mieux cibler les communications que nous leur envoyons en fonction de leur visite sur les sites.
Dans ce contexte, nous ne connaîtrons pas vos données personnelles tant que vous ne vous serez pas inscrit en remplissant un formulaire ou en nous communiquant d’une autre manière.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur les paramètres de confidentialité de Facebook et sur les options qui vous permettent de les modifier en suivant le lien suivant :</p>

<p>·         Les sites utilisent également des services de marketing et de suivi en ligne offerts par LinkedIn, Corp., plus particulièrement <b>LinkedIn Ads</b> et <b>LinkedIn Analytics.
</b>Les deux services recueillent et traitent les données relatives à l’utilisation et à l’interaction, les coordonnées, l’adresse IP et les données d’emplacement.
Nous utilisons LinkedIn Ads pour diriger le trafic vers les sites en servant des publicités en ligne sur LinkedIn.com qui pourraient éventuellement amener les utilisateurs vers les sites.
Nous utilisons LinkedIn Analytics pour évaluer le succès de nos campagnes de publicité afin que nous puissions voir quels utilisateurs finissent par devenir clients potentiels sur les sites.
Dans ce contexte, nous ne connaîtrons pas vos données personnelles tant que vous ne vous serez pas inscrit en remplissant un formulaire ou en nous communiquant d’une autre manière.</p>

<p>3.    <b>Az adatfeldolgozás jogalapja</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Ha a jogszabályok előírják, gondoskodunk arról, hogy személyes adatai feldolgozásának megfelelő jogalapja legyen.A legtöbb esetben a feldolgozás jogalapja a következő:</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       az adatok feldolgozására az Önnek nyújtott szolgáltatások teljesítéséhez van szükség;<br>
<br>
</p>

marketingcélra) való feldolgozásához.
vagy<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       az adatok feldolgozására jogos érdekeinknek való megfelelés, például webhelyeink, termékeink és/vagy szolgáltatásaink ügyfeleink érdekében történő fejlesztéséhez és javításához van szükség.</p>
<p>4.    <b>Az adatok névtelenítése</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
A vonatkozó törvényeknek megfelelően névtelenné tehetjük személyes adatait annak érdekében, hogy azok alapján Ön ne legyen azonosítható.A névtelen adatok nem számítanak személyes adatoknak, azért ezekre a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat nem vonatkozik.Névtelen adatokat bármilyen célból gyűjthetünk, használhatunk és megoszthatunk.</p>
<p>5.    <b>Mennyi ideig őrizzük meg az adatokat?</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
A személyes adatok megőrzésének időtartama a feldolgozás céljától függően eltérő lehet.A termékek és szolgáltatások biztosításához, illetve az Ön által kért tranzakciók teljesítéséhez szükséges személyes adatokat addig őrizzük meg, amíg Ön a Vállalat ügyfele.A marketingcélokra használt személyes adatokat addig őrizzük meg, amíg Ön a vonatkozó törvényeknek megfelelően le nem iratkozik az általunk küldött további közvetlen marketingkommunikációról.Ha Ön webhelyeinken keresztül álláspályázatot küld be, a jelentkezés részleteit az adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban vagy az állásjelentkezéssel kapcsolatban elérhetővé tett egyéb értesítésben meghatározott, illetve a törvény által előírt ideig őrizzük meg.A személyes adatokat minden egyéb esetben a jelen adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célok teljesítéséhez szükséges ideig őrizzük meg, amelyet követően az adatokat névtelenítjük (ha a vonatkozó törvények ezt lehetővé teszik), töröljük vagy megsemmisítjük.</p>
<p>6.    <b>Az adatok nyilvánosságra hozatala</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
A vonatkozó törvényeknek megfelelően személyes adatait bizonyos harmadik felekkel is megoszthatjuk.
Ezeket a harmadik feleket az alábbiakban ismertetjük.</p>
<p>·       <b>A csoport vállalatai.</b>
<br>
Személyes adatait a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célokhoz szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk társvállalatainkkal és a csoporthoz tartozó vállalatokkal.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Szolgáltatók.</b>
<br>
Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a nevünkben olyan szerződéses szolgáltatásokat nyújtó vállalatokkal, például mint a webhelyek üzemeltetése, felmérések végzése, tranzakciók feldolgozása, webhelyeink elemzése, valamint az üzletünk, webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink minőségének javítását célzó elemzések végzése.
Ezektől a szolgáltatóktól elvárjuk, hogy személyes adatait mindig bizalmasan kezeljék. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Forgalmazók és egyéb megbízható üzleti partnerek. </b>
<br>
Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a termékeinket forgalmazó harmadik felekkel és egyéb megbízható üzleti partnerekkel többek, és többek között engedélyezhetjük az ilyen harmadik feleknek, hogy marketinganyagokat küldjenek Önnek.
A személyes adatok marketingcélokból történő megosztása mindig a vonatkozó törvényeknek és jogszabályoknak megfelelően történik. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Az adatok közzététele tranzakciókkal kapcsolatban.</b>
<br>
Bizonyos tranzakciókkal kapcsolatban pénzügyi intézményekkel, kormányzati szervezetekkel, valamint a tranzakciók teljesítésében érintett szállítmányozási vállalatokkal és postai szolgáltatókkal oszthatjuk meg bizonyos személyes adatait vagy valamennyi személyes adatát.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Az adatok közzététele felvásárlásokkal vagy leválasztásokkal kapcsolatban. </b>
<br>
Előfordulhatnak olyan esetek, amikor stratégiai vagy üzleti célokból a Vállalat úgy dönt, hogy bizonyos országokban elad, megvásárol, leválaszt, összeolvaszt vagy egyéb módon átszervez egyes vállalatokat.
Ilyen esetben a vállalati eszközök egy részének vagy egészének összeolvasztásával, felvásárlásával, leválasztásával vagy eladásával járó műveletekre irányuló tárgyalásokhoz, illetve az ilyen műveletek teljesítéséhez szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk az Önről tárolt adatokat. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Egyéb okokból történő közzététel.</b>
<br>
Személyes adatait olyan esetben is közzétehetjük, ha azt törvény írja elő vagy teszi lehetővé, illetve ha jóhiszeműen úgy véljük, hogy az adatok közzétételére törvényi kötelezettségeinknek vagy jogi eljárásnak való megfelelés, jogaink vagy tulajdonunk védelme, valamint sürgős esetekben valamely személy biztonságának védelme érdekében van szükség.</p>

<p>
<br>
Elkötelezettek vagyunk személyes adatai védelme iránt.
Számos különböző biztonsági technológiát és eljárást alkalmazunk annak érdekében, hogy személyes adatait megóvjuk a jogosulatlan hozzáférés, felhasználás és közzététel ellen, beleértve a vonatkozó törvények által megkövetelt biztonsági óvintézkedések végrehajtását.
Azonban egyetlen információs rendszer sem lehet 100%-osan biztonságos, így nem garantálhatjuk személyes adatai teljes biztonságát.
Emellett nem vállalunk felelősséget a nem az általunk kezelt hálózatokon, például az interneten és vezeték nélküli hálózatokon keresztül a webhelyekre továbbított adatok biztonságáért.</p>
<p>
<br>
Személyes adatainak biztonságáért Ön is felelősséggel tartozik.Ha a webhelyek használatához felhasználói azonosítót és jelszót kapott tőlünk (vagy felhasználói azonosítót és jelszót választott magának), az Ön felelőssége, hogy ezeket a bejelentkezési adatokat bizalmasan kezelje, és ne ossza meg ezeket másokkal.</p>

<li>
<b>Mi az a cookie? </b>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A cookie-k kis mennyiségű információt tartalmazó szöveges fájlok, amelyeket a webhelyeink használata során a merevlemezén vagy a böngésző memóriájában helyezünk el.
A cookie-k azért hasznosak, mert segítséget nyújtanak a webhelyek tartalmának és elrendezésének optimalizálásában, és lehetővé teszik azon számítógépek és egyéb eszközök felismerését, amelyekkel korábban már ellátogattak a webhelyeinkre.
A cookie-k több különböző feladatot töltenek be, például lehetővé teszik a preferenciákkal kapcsolatos beállítások megjegyzését, és segítenek a felhasználói élmény, valamint a webhelyek használhatóságának és teljesítményének javításában.</p>
<p>A webhelyeink emellett adatgyűjtő jeleket (más néven egypixeles GIF-eket) is tartalmazhatnak, amelyek segítségével nyomon követhetjük az adott oldalakat meglátogató felhasználók számát.
Adatgyűjtő jeleket a promóciós e-mailekben és hírlevelekben is elhelyezhetünk annak meghatározására, hogy az üzeneteket megnyitotta-e, illetve végzett-e valamilyen műveletet azokkal kapcsolatban.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Az általunk használt cookie-k és egyéb technológiák kategóriái</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Webhelyeinken az alábbi négy kategóriába tartozó cookie-kat és hasonló technológiákat használunk: Feltétlenül szükséges, teljesítményjavító, funkcionalitást lehetővé tevő és profillal kapcsolatos, valamint hirdetési cookie-k.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Feltétlenül szükséges cookie-k</b>
</p>
<p>Ezek a cookie-k feltétlenül szükségesek az oldal alapvető funkcióinak használatához, és ezek teszik lehetővé a webhelyeinken történő navigálást, valamint a webhelyek funkcióinak használatát, különös tekintettel a keresésekkel és megrendelésekkel kapcsolatos funkciókra.
Ezek nélkül a cookie-k nélkül nem tudjuk biztosítani az Ön által kért szolgáltatásokat.
Ezek a cookie-k nem gyűjtenek Önről marketingcélokra használható információkat, és nem jegyzik meg, hogy milyen oldalakat látogatott meg az interneten.
Feltétlenül szükséges cookie-k például a következők: a bevásárlókosár-cookie, amely arra szolgál, hogy megjegyezze az Ön által megvásárolni kívánt termékeket, amikor termékeket ad hozzá a bevásárlókosárhoz, illetve amikor a kifizetési oldalra lép.
a bejelentkezési/hitelesítési cookie, amely lehetővé teszi a webhelyre való bejelentkezést, és azonosítja a felhasználókat a bejelentkezést követően az egyszeri bejelentkezés érdekében.
a munkamenetcookie, amelyre az adatátvitel elvégzéséhez van szükség, és amely lehetővé teszi a webhely elérését.
a biztonsági cookie, amely érzékeli a többszöri sikertelen bejelentkezési kísérleteket, valamint a webhelyeink egyéb nem megfelelő módon történő használatát.
Az ilyen típusú cookie-kat csak addig tárolja a rendszer, amíg az a rendeltetésük érdekében szükséges.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Teljesítménycookie-k</b>
</p>
<p>Ezek a cookie-k a webhelyeink használatával kapcsolatos információkat gyűjtenek, például melyik oldalakat látogatja a leggyakrabban, és kapott-e hibaüzenetet bizonyos oldalakról.
Az ilyen cookie-kkal gyűjtött információkat webhelyeink működésének javítására használjuk fel.
Ezek nélkül a cookie-k nélkül nem tudjuk meghatározni webhelyeink teljesítményét, és nem tudunk azokon az Ön böngészési élményét javító fejlesztéseket végezni.
A webhelyeinken használt teljesítményjavító cookie például a Google és az Adobe Analytics cookie (lásd alább).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Funkciókkal és profillal kapcsolatos cookie-k</b>
</p>
<p>Ezekkel a cookie-kkal a webhelyeink az Ön által nyújtott információkat (pl.
nyelvi beállításokat), valamint a webhelyeinken végzett műveletekhez hasznos technikai jellegű információkat tárolják el.
Ezek a cookie-k például megjegyzik az Ön felhasználói azonosítóját és felhasználói profilja elemeit.
Arról is gondoskodnak, hogy webhelyeinken releváns felhasználói élményt nyújthassunk Önnek.
Ezeket a cookie-kat az Ön által kért szolgáltatások (például videomegtekintés vagy hozzászólás egy bloghoz) teljesítéséhez is felhasználhatjuk (ugyanakkor ezek a cookie-k nem feltétlenül szükségesek a webhely alapvető funkcióinak használatához, lást az 1.
kategóriát).
Ezeket a cookie-kat nem használjuk a más webhelyeken végzett böngészési tevékenységek nyomon követéséhez.</p>
<p>Ezek nélkül a cookie-k nélkül a webhelyeink nem képesek megjegyezni az Ön korábbi választásait, illetve nem tudnak személyre szabott böngészési élményt biztosítani.
Például egy cookie-t használunk az Ön nyelvi beállításainak tárolásához, így mindig a megfelelő nyelven jeleníthetjük meg Önnek a keresési eredményeket.
Emellett a webhelyeinken megjelenő, a cookie-használatról tájékoztató banner megjelenítésével kapcsolatos beállítását is egy cookie segítéségével tároljuk.
Ez a cookie abban segít, hogy megjegyezzük a cookie-k használatáról tájékoztató banner megjelenésével kapcsolatos beállítását, amikor ismét egy olyan oldalra, illetve azonos tartománynevű vagy azonos legelső tartományú vállalati oldalra látogat, ahol korábban már elvégezte a banner megjelenésével kapcsolatos beállítást.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Hirdetési cookie-k és hasonló technológiák</b>
</p>
<p>Ezek a cookie-k vagy hasonló technológiák az Ön számára releváns és az érdeklődési körének megfelelő hirdetések megjelenítését szolgálják.
Emellett ezeket a cookie-kat a hirdetések megjelenítési számának korlátozására, valamint a reklámkampányaink hatékonyságának mérésére is használhatjuk.
Ezek a cookie-k a más webhelyeken tett látogatásait is nyomon követhetik.
Ezek nélkül a cookie-k és egyéb technológiák nélkül kevésbé releváns és az érdeklődésének kevésbé megfelelő online hirdetéseket fog látni.</p>
<p>A harmadik fél hirdetési partnerek (lásd alább) számára engedélyezzük, hogy cookie-k és egyéb technológiák használatával információkat gyűjtsenek a webhelyek használata során végzett böngészési tevékenységekről, többek között a megtekintett és megvásárolt termékekről, valamint helyadatairól.
A hirdetési cookie-k és hasonló technológiák közé tartoznak a Google AdWords és a Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>A cookie-k beállítása<br>
</b>
<br>
A böngésző beállításainak módosításával általában elutasíthatja a cookie-kat, illetve a böngészőben a cookie-k elutasításával vagy letiltásával vagy az alább felsorolt opciókon keresztül bizonyos cookie-k letiltásával bármikor visszavonhatja a hozzájárulását.
Ha úgy dönt, hogy teljesen elutasítja a cookie-kat, elképzelhető, hogy nem használhatja a webhelyek minden funkcióját.</p>
<p>
<b>A webanalitika használata<br>
<br>
</b>Az oldalainkon tett látogatások nyomon követéséhez az iparági szabványnak webanalitikát használunk.
A cookie által a webhelyek használatával kapcsolatban generált adatokat (az IP-címet is beleértve) a webanalitikai szolgáltatókhoz továbbítjuk, amelyeket ezek a szolgáltatók saját kiszolgálóikon tárolnak.
A webanalitikai szolgáltatók ezeket az információkat a webhelyeink használatának értékeléséhez, a webhelyek üzemeltetőinek szóló és a webhelyen végzett tevékenységekkel kapcsolatos jelentések elkészítéséhez, valamint a webhelyeken végzett tevékenységekkel és az internethasználattal kapcsolatos egyéb szolgáltatások biztosításához használják fel (az alábbiakban meghatározott módon).
A webanalitikai szolgáltatók ezeket az információkat harmadik feleknek is továbbíthatják, ha erre törvény kötelezi őket, illetve ha ezek a harmadik felek a nevükben végeznek adatfeldolgozást.</p>
<p>Különböző analitikai eszközöket használunk, amelyek célja a marketingtevékenységek mérése, elemzése és optimalizálása, valamint az Ön érdeklődési körének megfelelő, személyre szabott hirdetések megjelenítése.
Többek között az alábbi eszközöket használjuk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, a Twitter, Inc.
(„Twitter”) szolgáltatása.
A Twitter a hirdetési technológia integrálása révén közvetlen információkat gyűjt a webhelyek használatáról.
Ilyen információk például a böngésző cookie-azonosítói, a mobileszköz-azonosítók, a hash e-mail-címek, a demográfiai és érdeklődési körrel kapcsolatos adatok, valamint a megtekintett tartalmak és webhelyen végzett tevékenységek.

<b>Google Analytics és DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, a Google Inc.
(„Google”) szolgáltatásai: A Google Analytics a webhelyek használatának elemzésére szolgáló cookie-kat használ.
A szolgáltatás az összegyűjtött információkat (IP-cím, böngészési műveletek, valamint a webhelyek használatával kapcsolatos egyéb adatok, pl.
a forrásoldal részletei, a böngésző és az operációs rendszer típusa, külső hivatkozásokra történő kattintások, webhelyspecifikus widgetekkel végzett műveletek) általában a Google egy egyesült államokbeli kiszolgálójára továbbítja.
Azonban a portálon aktivált IP-anonimizálás miatt a Google az Európai Unió/Európai Gazdasági Térség tagállamain belül lerövidíti az IP-címet (ha az EU/EGT területén használja a webhelyet).
Csak a kivételes esetekben fordul elő, hogy a szolgáltatás a teljes IP-címet egy egyesült államokbeli Google-kiszolgálóra továbbítja, és csak ott rövidíti le.
A Google szerint a Google Analytics keretében a böngészője által továbbított IP-címet a szolgáltatás nem egyesíti egyéb Google-adatokkal.

<b>A DoubleClick</b> a digitális hirdetések kezelésére szolgáló eszköz.
A <b>Floodlight</b> rögzíti a konverziókat, azaz valamely hirdetés megtekintése vagy valamely hirdetésre történő kattintás után a webhely felhasználói által végzett műveleteket, és jelentéseket készít azokkal kapcsolatban, emellett pedig célközönségeket állít be a marketingtevékenységek és -kampányok optimalizálásához.
A szolgáltatás letiltásához módosítsa a böngésző beállításait a fentiekben ismertetett módon.</p>
<p>·         Webhelyeinken emellett a Google <b>Google Tag Manager</b> szolgáltatását is használjuk, amelynek köszönhetően egyetlen felületről kezelhetjük a webhely minden címkéjét.
Az eszköz a címkék alkalmazása után további olyan címkéket aktivál, amelyek (személyes) adatokat gyűjtenek.
A Google Tag Manager azonban nem fér hozzá ezekhez az adatokhoz.</p>

<b>SessionCam</b> – webhelyeink a SessionCam segítségével rögzítik a webhelyek látogatóinak navigációját, hogy azonosítsák a látogatók számára a használhatósági problémákat.
A SessionCam gyűjti össze a látogatók adatait.
Ezek névtelenek és nem tartalmaznak személyes azonosításra alkalmas információt.
Ennek részeként a SessionCam rögzíti az egérmozgásokat, kattintásokat, mobil gesztusokat, űrlapbevitelt, görgetést.
Ha többet szeretne tudni arról, hogy a SessionCam hogyan használja a sütiket, tekintse meg a SessionCam adatvédelmi irányelveit.
Egyéni felhasználóként azt is választhatja, hogy a SessionCam ne rögzítse az összes névtelen tevékenységét a webhelyen. Ezt megteheti, ha ide kattint: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
A SessionCam webhely egyik oldalára lép, ahol egy kattintással kikapcsolhatja a SessionCam által készített felvételt.
Ha ezt választja, akkor a böngészőjében be lesz állítva egy süti, amelyet a SessionCam használ annak jelzésére, hogy az eszközéről tett látogatások ne legyenek rögzítve.
A szolgáltatás által összegyűjtött adatok weboldalunk használhatóságának javítását szolgálják.
Az összegyűjtött adatokat tároljuk és összesített, illetve statisztikai jelentések készítéséhez használjuk fel, továbbá értékeljük azért, hogy a látogatóink számára a webhelyeink működését javítsuk.<i>

Inoltre, non siamo responsabili per la sicurezza delle informazioni trasmesse ai siti Honeywell tramite reti delle quali non abbiamo il controllo, incluse le reti Internet e wireless.</p>
<p>La sicurezza e la protezione delle informazioni personali dipendono anche dall'utente stesso.Nel caso in cui vengono forniti (o scelti) un ID utente e una password di accesso ai siti Honeywell, l'utente ha la responsabilità di mantenere tali credenziali di accesso riservate e di non rivelarle ad altre persone.</p>

<b>9)    Cookie e tecnologie similari.
web analytics</b>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cos'è un cookie? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I cookie sono file di testo contenenti poche informazioni, che vengono scaricati sul disco rigido dell'utente o nella memoria del suo browser quando viene visitato un Sito Honeywell.
I cookie sono utili per organizzare i contenuti e definire il layout dei siti Honeywell, consentendoci di riconoscere computer o altri dispositivi che si sono collegati a tali siti in passato.
I cookie svolgono molte funzioni diverse.
ad esempio, permettono ai siti Honeywell di ricordare le preferenze dell'utente e aiutano Honeywell a migliorare l'usabilità e le prestazioni dei suoi siti e l'esperienza dell'utente durante il loro utilizzo.</p>
<p>I nostri siti possono contenere immagini elettroniche conosciute come web beacon o single-pixel gif (immagini con un pixel singolo), che ci consentono di contare il numero di utenti che visitano determinate pagine.
Ulteriormente, possiamo inserire web beacon nelle e-mail promozionali o nelle newsletter, per determinare se i messaggi vengono aperti e utilizzati.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Categorie di cookie e tecnologie analoghe utilizzate da Honeywell</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I tipi di cookie o di tecnologie analoghe che potrebbero essere utilizzati sui siti Honeywell rientrano in una delle seguenti quattro categorie: strettamente necessari, prestazionali, funzionali e di profilo oppure pubblicitari.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Cookie strettamente necessari</b>
</p>
<p>Questi cookie sono essenziali, in quanto consentono all'utente di navigare all'interno del Sito e di utilizzare le sue funzionalità, in particolare per quanto concerne la ricerca di informazioni e la richiesta di ordini.
Senza questi cookie non è possibile fornire i servizi richiesti dall'utente.
Questi cookie non raccolgono informazioni sull'utente che potrebbero essere utilizzate a scopi di marketing o per ricordare la cronologia di navigazione su Internet.
Gli esempi dei cookie strettamente necessari sono un cookie del cestino degli acquisti, utilizzato per ricordare i prodotti che si desidera acquistare quando si aggiungono i prodotti al carrello degli acquisti o si procede all'acquisto, un cookie di accesso/autenticazione che consente e gestisce l'accesso al Sito e identifica l'utente dopo l'accesso per una singola sessione, un cookie di sessione che è necessario per eseguire la trasmissione dei dati e fornire il Sito all'utente, un cookie di sicurezza che rileva ripetuti tentativi di accesso non riuscito o simili abusi dei Siti.
Questi tipi di cookie vengono archiviati regolarmente solo a condizione che siano necessari per il loro scopo.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Cookie prestazionali</b>
</p>
<p>Questi cookie raccolgono informazioni su come l'utente utilizza i nostri Siti, per esempio quali pagine ha visitato più spesso o se ha ricevuto messaggi di errore da certe pagine.
Questi cookie raccolgono informazioni che vengono utilizzate per migliorare le prestazioni dei nostri Siti.
Senza questi cookie non siamo in grado di verificare le prestazioni dei nostri Siti e di apportare i miglioramenti necessari per una migliore navigazione.
Esempi di cookie prestazionali utilizzati dai nostri Siti includono cookie da Google e Adobe Analytics (vedere in seguito per maggiori dettagli).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Cookie relativi alle funzionalità e al profilo</b>
</p>
<p>Questi cookie consentono ai nostri Siti di archiviare alcune informazioni fornite dall'utente, come le preferenze di lingua o informazioni tecniche utili per l'interazione con i nostri Siti.
Per esempio, tali cookie possono memorizzare l'ID utente o alcuni elementi del profilo dell'utente.
Garantiscono inoltre che l'esperienza con i Siti sia pertinente per l'utente.
Possono inoltre essere utilizzati per fornire servizi richiesti dall'utente, ad esempio visualizzazione di un video o invio di commenti su un blog (senza essere un cookie strettamente necessario per il funzionamento del Sito, vedere la categoria 1).
Questi cookie non verranno utilizzati per tenere traccia dell'attività di navigazione dell'utente su altri siti Web.</p>
<p>Senza questi cookie, un sito Web non è in grado di ricordare le scelte effettuate in precedenza dall'utente o di personalizzare l'esperienza di navigazione.
Per esempio, utilizziamo un cookie per memorizzare le preferenze di lingua, e ciò ci consente di fornire contenuti nella lingua dell'utente, oppure possiamo utilizzare un cookie per memorizzare le preferenze dell'utente in merito alla visualizzazione dei banner pubblicitari sui nostri Siti.
Tale tipo di cookie ci consente di ricordare la scelta dell'utente relativa alla visualizzazione o meno del banner informativo quando l'utente torna a visitare lo stesso sito su cui ha già specificato la propria preferenza, evitando così di doverla ripetere su altri Siti Honeywell con lo stesso dominio o sullo stesso livello di dominio.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Cookie pubblicitari e tecnologie simili</b>
</p>
<p>I suddetti cookie o tecnologie simili possono essere utilizzati per fornire annunci che siano di maggiore pertinenza per l'utente e i suoi interessi.
Possono anche essere utilizzati per limitare il numero di volte in cui l'utente visualizza una pubblicità, così come per aiutarci a valutare l'efficacia di una campagna pubblicitaria.
Questi cookie potrebbero tenere traccia delle visite dell'utente su altri siti Web.
Senza questi cookie o altre tecnologie, le pubblicità online visualizzate dall'utente saranno meno di suo interesse o gradimento.</p>
<p>Honeywell consente a partner pubblicitari esterni di utilizzare cookie e altre tecnologie per raccogliere informazioni relative alle attività di navigazione nel tempo e in diversi siti Web quando l'utente utilizza i nostri Siti, incluse le informazioni relative ai prodotti cercati o acquistati dall'utente e alla sua posizione.
Esempi di cookie pubblicitari o tecnologie simili che utilizziamo comprendono Google AdWords e pixel di Facebook.</p>
<p>
<b>Impostazione delle preferenze dei cookie<br>
</b>
<br>
È generalmente possibile modificare le impostazioni del browser per rifiutare i cookie ed è possibile ritirare il proprio consenso in qualsiasi momento modificando le impostazioni del browser per rifiutare o disabilitare i cookie o scegliendo di rifiutare cookie specifici attraverso le opzioni di opt-out condivise di seguito.
Un utente che scelga di non accettare l'utilizzo di tutti i cookie potrebbe non essere in grado di sfruttare appieno le caratteristiche dei Siti Honeywell o di altri siti Web visitati.</p>
<p>
<b>Utilizzo di strumenti di web analytics da parte di Honeywell<br>
<br>
</b>Honeywell utilizza strumenti di web analytics standard di settore per tenere traccia delle visite ai nostri Siti ("Fornitori di strumenti di web analytics").
Le informazioni generate dai cookie riguardo l'utilizzo da parte dell'utente dei nostri Siti (compreso l'indirizzo IP dell'utente stesso) saranno trasmesse e archiviate dai nostri fornitori di strumenti di web analytics sui loro server.
I fornitori di strumenti di web analytics ricorreranno a tali informazioni allo scopo di valutare l'uso dei Siti Honeywell da parte dell'utente, di compilare rapporti sull'attività dei siti Web per gli operatori dei siti e di erogare altri servizi correlati all'attività dei siti Web e all'utilizzo di Internet (come specificato in seguito).
I fornitori di strumenti di web analytics potranno inoltre trasferire tali informazioni a terze parti nei casi previsti dalla legge o qualora tali terze parti elaborino le informazioni per loro conto.</p>
<p>Utilizziamo strumenti di analisi differenti che servono allo scopo di misurare, analizzare e ottimizzare le nostre misure di marketing e fornire all'utente annunci pubblicitari personalizzati che potrebbero essere di particolare interesse.
In particolare, utilizziamo i seguenti strumenti:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, servizio di Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter raccoglie informazioni direttamente in base all'utilizzo dei Siti integrando la sua tecnologia pubblicitaria.
Queste informazioni includono ID cookie del browser, ID dispositivo mobile, indirizzi e-mail con hash, dati demografici o di interessi e contenuti visualizzati o azioni intraprese sui Siti.
È possibile scegliere di effettuare il recesso da Twitter Advertising seguendo il collegamento seguente:</li>
</ul>
<p>Collegamento per il recesso da Twitter Advertising</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Google Analytics and DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, entrambi servizi di Google Inc.
("Google"): Google Analytics utilizza i cookie che consentono di analizzare l'utilizzo dei Siti.
Le informazioni raccolte (indirizzo IP, attività di navigazione e altri dati legati all'utilizzo dei Siti, ad esempio i dettagli del sito di riferimento, tipo di browser Web e sistema operativo, i clic su collegamenti esterni, l'interazione con i widget specifici del Sito) di solito sono trasferite a un server Google negli Stati Uniti e qui archiviati.
Tuttavia, a causa dell'anonimizzazione dell'indirizzo IP attivata sul portale, Google ridurrà in precedenza l'indirizzo IP dell'utente all'interno degli Stati membri dell'Unione europea/Spazio economico europeo (se l'utente naviga nel Sito nell'UE/SEE).
Solo in casi eccezionali, l'indirizzo IP completo sarà trasmesso a un server Google negli Stati Uniti e ridotto in questa sede.
In base a quanto definito da Google, l'indirizzo IP trasmesso dal browser nel quadro di Google Analytics non sarà unito ad altri dati di Google.
L'utente è in grado di effettuare il recesso da Google Analytics seguendo il collegamento riportato di seguito:</li>
</ul>
<p>Collegamento per il recesso da Google Analytics</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> è uno strumento per la gestione della pubblicità digitale.
<b>Floodlight</b> acquisisce e segnala informazioni sulle conversioni: attività degli utenti del Sito Web dopo che hanno visto o fatto clic su un annuncio pubblicitario e imposta il pubblico di destinazione per ottimizzare le misure e le campagne di marketing.
È possibile effettuare il recesso modificando le impostazioni del browser come descritto in precedenza.</p>
<p>·         Inoltre, i nostri Siti utilizzano <b>Google Tag Manager</b> di Google, che consente di gestire i tag del sito Web tramite un'unica interfaccia.
Lo strumento stesso (implementazione dei tag) attiva altri tag che possono raccogliere i dati (personali).
Tuttavia, Google Tag Manager non accede a questi dati.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>Session Cam</b> – i nostri siti utilizzano SessionCam per creare registrazioni delle sessioni di navigazione del sito Web dei visitatori, al fine di identificare problemi relativi alla facilità di utilizzo da parte degli utenti.
Le informazioni sui visitatori raccolte da SessionCam sono anonime e non includono dati di identificazione personale.
Come parte di tale processo, SessionCam registra i movimenti del mouse, i clic, i gesti per dispositivi mobili, l'input dei moduli, lo scorrimento.
Per scoprire maggiori informazioni sul modo in cui Session Cam utilizza i cookie, consultare l’Informativa sulla privacy di SessionCam.
Ogni utente può scegliere che tutte le sue attività anonime sul sito Web non vengano registrate da SessionCam. Ciò può essere fatto facendo clic qui: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
L'utente verrà indirizzato a una pagina del sito Web di SessionCam dove, con un solo clic, potrà disattivare la registrazione di SessionCam.
Se si sceglie questa opzione, nel browser dell’utente viene impostato un cookie che sarà poi utilizzato da SessionCam per non registrare eventuali visite dal dispositivo dell’utente.
I dati raccolti da questo servizio sono usati per migliorare la facilità di utilizzo del nostro sito.
Le informazioni raccolte vengono archiviate e utilizzate per report aggregati e statistici e vengono valutate per migliorare la funzionalità dei nostri siti Web per i visitatori.<i>

<b>Rollworks di NextRoll</b> - Quando i visitatori arrivano sul nostro sito, questo utilizza strumenti di terze parti (come RollWorks) e può inserire cookie nei browser dei visitatori allo scopo di inviare inserzioni mirate.
Utilizziamo questi dati per fornire contenuti pubblicitari pertinenti all'esperienza di navigazione sul nostro sito.
I dati raccolti possono includere attività del sito Web, indirizzi IP e identificatori di cookie.  Si tenga presente che continueranno ad essere visualizzati annunci pubblicitari anche annullando la sottoscrizione, ma non saranno personalizzati da RollWorks.

<p>·         I Siti utilizzano inoltre i servizi di Adobe Inc.
("Adobe"), in particolare <b>Adobe Audience Manager</b>, una piattaforma per la gestione dei dati che ci aiuta a creare profili di pubblico unici in modo da identificare i nostri segmenti di maggior valore e <b>Adobe Analytics</b>, che ci consente di analizzare l'utilizzo del nostro Sito Web al fine di ottimizzarne il design e l'usabilità e di adattarlo meglio alle esigenze dei visitatori.
A questo scopo, Adobe Analytics raccoglierà i dati personali, quali l'indirizzo IP e altri identificatori, informazioni sull'utilizzo, indirizzo e-mail e dati sulla posizione.
È possibile scegliere di effettuare il recesso dai servizi di Adobe Analytics seguendo il collegamento riportato di seguito:</p>
<p>Collegamento per il recesso da Adobe Analytics</p>
<p>·         I Siti utilizzano <b>Facebook Custom Audience</b>, un servizio fornito da Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025, Stati Uniti, un servizio di remarketing che ci permette di indirizzare i visitatori ai nostri Siti tramite Facebook con la pubblicità posizionata da noi.
La visualizzazione di pubblicità personalizzata si basa su un'analisi dell'utilizzo dei nostri Siti utilizzando i cookie e le tecnologie simili, come i tracking pixel, che ci consentono di identificare i clienti che alla fine si convertono in un lead da una campagna Facebook.com.
Questo ci aiuta a dimostrare l'efficacia delle nostre campagne di marketing.
Inoltre, il servizio consente di monitorare l'attività del sito Web per creare pubblico in modo che sia possibile riorientare ulteriormente le comunicazioni in base alle visite ai Siti.
Non avremo accesso a informazioni di alcun tipo sui dati personali in questo contesto fino a quando l'utente non le fornisce compilando un modulo o contattandoci in altro modo.</p>
<p>È possibile reperire ulteriori informazioni sulle impostazioni relative alla privacy di Facebook e sulle opzioni per modificarle accedendo al seguente collegamento:</p>
<p>Collegamento alle impostazioni di privacy di Facebook (l'utente deve essere connesso con il proprio account).</p>
<p>·         I Siti utilizzano inoltre il marketing online e i servizi di tracking offerti da LinkedIn, Corp., in particolare <b>LinkedIn Ads</b> e <b>LinkedIn Analytics.
</b>Entrambi i servizi raccolgono ed elaborano i dati sull'utilizzo e sulle interazioni, le informazioni di contatto, l'indirizzo IP e i dati sulla posizione.
Utilizziamo LinkedIn Ads per indirizzare il traffico verso i Siti servendo pubblicità online su LinkedIn.com che possono alla fine condurre gli utenti ai Siti.
Utilizziamo LinkedIn Analytics per misurare il successo delle nostre campagne pubblicitarie in modo da poter vedere quali utenti alla fine si convertono in un lead sui Siti.
Non avremo accesso a informazioni di alcun tipo sui dati personali in questo contesto fino a quando l'utente non le fornisce compilando un modulo o contattandoci in altro modo.</p>
<p>È possibile escludere da LinkedIn il targeting dei cookie facendo clic sul seguente collegamento per il recesso:</p>
<p>Collegamento per il recesso da LinkedIn</p>
<p>·         I nostri Siti utilizzano anche il servizio di marketing <b>AddThis</b>, fornito da by Oracle America, Inc.
e lo strumento di misurazione del coinvolgimento dell'utente <b>Marketo, </b>offerto da Marketo Inc.
AddThis è uno strumento di condivisione social utilizzato sui Siti all'interno di articoli di notizie e potrebbe raccogliere dati sui Siti utilizzando un cookie per eseguire il servizio di targeting che utilizziamo per migliorare i nostri servizi e fornire annunci personalizzati.
I dati elaborati da AddThis includono ID univoci (ad es.
ID cookie), indirizzo IP, posizione geografica, informazioni sul dispositivo quali il tipo di browser e dispositivo, il sistema operativo e la lingua preferita, la data e l'ora in cui sono stati visitati i Siti e l'URL di riferimento.</p>
<p>È possibile effettuare il recesso da AddThis facendo clic sul collegamento seguente:</p>
<p>Collegamento per il recesso da AddThis</p>
<p>I cookie di Marketo sono utilizzati per misurare il coinvolgimento degli utenti con i Siti, gli eventi online, la pubblicità e i contenuti online, ad esempio i download di white paper.
Il cookie consente di collegare un utente al destinatario di una campagna di e-mail marketing per misurare l'efficacia della campagna.
I dati personali raccolti possono includere quanto segue: ora della visita, pagine visitate, dettagli del sito di riferimento, tipo di browser Web e sistema operativo, interazioni sul sito, posizione di rete, indirizzo IP, download di documenti, clic su collegamenti che portano a siti Web esterni.
Nel servizio fornito da Marketo utilizziamo la funzione di anonimizzazione dell'indirizzo IP.</p>
<p>             <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>10) Non monitorare</b>
</p>
<p>Alcuni browser Web possono trasmettere segnali "non-monitorare" ai siti con cui l'utente comunica.A causa delle diverse modalità con cui i browser Web integrano e attivano tale funzionalità, non è sempre chiaro se gli utenti desiderano che tali segnali vengano trasmessi o se invece non sono neppure al corrente del loro invio.Al momento, Honeywell non intraprende alcuna azione in risposta a questi segnali.</p>

<p>9.    <b>쿠키와 유사 기술, 웹 분석</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>쿠키란? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>쿠키는 사용자가 당사 사이트 중 하나를 방문할 때 사용자의 하드 디스크나 브라우저의 메모리에 다운로드되는 텍스트 파일로, 소량의 정보가 담겨 있습니다.
쿠키는 사이트의 콘텐츠와 레이아웃을 정렬하는 데 도움이 되고 이전에 당사 사이트에 접속한 적이 있는 컴퓨터나 기타 장치를 인식할 수 있기 때문에 유용합니다.
쿠키는 당사 웹 사이트에서 사용자가 선호하는 설정을 기억할 수 있게 하고, 사이트의 성능과 유용성을 높이며 사이트를 사용하는 사용자의 경험을 향상시키는 등 다양한 역할을 합니다.</p>
<p>또한 당사 사이트에는 웹 탐지 장치라고 하는 전자 이미지(때로는 단일 픽셀 gif이라고 부름)가 포함되어 있을 수 있으며 이는 특정 페이지를 방문하는 사용자의 수를 계산하는 데 사용됩니다.
또한 홍보용 이메일 메시지나 뉴스레터에도 메시지를 읽었는지 여부와 이에 어떤 대응을 했는지를 확인하기 위한 웹 탐지 장치가 있을 수 있습니다.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>당사가 사용하는 쿠키와 유사 기술의 범주</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>당사 사이트에 사용될 수 있는 쿠키 또는 유사 기술은 필수, 성능, 기능과 프로필, 광고의 네 가지 범주 중 하나에 속할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    필수 쿠키</b>
</p>
<p>필수 쿠키는 사이트의 기본 기능에 꼭 필요한 것이며, 특히 정보 검색과 주문과 관련하여 사용자가 당사 사이트를 이동하고 기능을 사용할 수 있게 해줍니다.
이 쿠키가 없으면 요청한 서비스를 제공할 수 없습니다.
이 쿠키는 사용자의 인터넷 사용 내역을 기억하거나 마케팅을 위해 사용될 수 있는 정보를 수집하지 않습니다.
필수 쿠키의 예로 장바구니 쿠키가 있으며, 이 쿠키는 사용자가 제품을 장바구니에 추가하거나 결제를 진행할 때 사용자가 구입하려는 제품을 기억하는 데 사용됩니다.
로그인/인증 쿠키는 사이트 로그인을 허용하고 관리하며 사용자가 세션에 로그인한 후 사용자를 식별합니다.
세션 쿠키는 데이터 전송과 사용자에게 사이트를 제공하는 데 필요하고, 보안 쿠키는 반복적으로 실패한 로그인 시도나 이와 유사한 사이트의 잘못된 사용을 파악합니다.
이러한 유형의 쿠키는 이러한 용도에 필요한 만큼만 정기적으로 저장됩니다.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    성능 쿠키</b>
</p>
<p>이러한 쿠키는 사용자가 당사 사이트를 사용하는 방식에 대한 정보를 수집합니다.
예를 들어 사용자가 가장 자주 이용하는 페이지는 무엇인지, 특정 페이지에서 오류 메시지를 받았는지 등의 정보를 수집합니다.
이 쿠키는 사이트의 성능을 향상하기 위해 사용되는 정보를 수집합니다.
이 쿠키가 없으면 사이트의 성능을 파악할 수 없고, 사용자의 사이트 탐색 경험을 높일 수 있는 개선을 이룰 수 업습니다.
당사 사이트에서 사용하는 성능 쿠키의 예로는 Google과 Adobe Analytics 등의 쿠키가 있습니다(자세한 내용은 아래 참조).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    기능 및 프로필 쿠키</b>
</p>
<p>당사 사이트는 이 쿠키를 사용하여 사용자가 제공하는 기본 설정 등과 같은 정보를 저장하고, 사용자와 사이트의 상호 작용에 유용한 기술 정보를 저장합니다.
예를 들어 이 쿠키는 사용자 ID와 사용자 프로필의 내용을 기억합니다.
또한 사용자가 사이트를 이용할 때 사용자에게 관련이 있는 내용이 표시되도록 합니다.
또한 비디오를 보거나 블로그에 댓글을 다는 등 사용자가 요청한 서비스를 제공하는 데 사용될 수도 있습니다.(사이트가 작동하는 데 꼭 필요한 쿠키는 아닙니다.
범주 1을 참조하세요.) 이 쿠키는 다른 웹 사이트에서 사용자가 어떤 탐색 활동을 하는지 추적하는 데 사용되지 않습니다.</p>
<p>이 쿠키가 없으면 웹 사이트에서 사용자가 이전에 선택한 설정을 기억할 수 없으며 사용자의 탐색 경험을 사용자에게 맞게 특화할 수 없습니다.
예를 들어 당사는 쿠키를 사용하여 사용자의 언어 설정을 저장함으로써 제품 검색 결과를 해당 언어로 표시하며, 당사 사이트에 표시되는 쿠키 정보 배너의 모양 중 사용자가 선택한 모양이 무엇인지 저장합니다.
이 쿠키는 사용자가 선택한 쿠키 정보 배너의 모양을 기억하여 동일한 사이트를 다시 방문하거나 동일한 도메인의 사이트 또는 상위 도메인이 같은 다른 사이트를 방문할 때 이 모양으로 배너를 표시하는 데 도움이 됩니다.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    광고 쿠키 및 유사 기술</b>
</p>
<p>이러한 쿠키 또는 유사한 기술은 사용자 및 사용자의 관심사와 더 관련이 깊은 광고를 제공하기 위해 사용될 수 있습니다.
또한 광고가 사용자에게 노출되는 횟수를 제한하고 광고 캠페인의 효율성을 측정하는 데에도 사용될 수 있습니다.
이 쿠키는 사용자의 다른 사이트 방문을 추적할 수 있습니다.
이 쿠키 또는 유사 기술이 없으면 사용자와 관련성이 떨어지고 관심도가 낮은 온라인 광고가 사용자에게 표시됩니다.</p>
<p>당사는 사용자가 탐색하거나 구매하는 제품 및 사용자 위치를 포함하여 사용자가 당사 사이트를 이용할 때의 시간에 따른 활동과 서로 다른 웹 사이트에서의 탐색 활동에 대한 정보를 타사 광고 파트너(아래 참조)가 쿠키 및 기타 기술을 사용하여 수집할 수 있도록 허용합니다.
당사가 사용하는 광고 쿠키 또는 유사한 기술의 예로는 Google AdWords, Facebook Pixel 등이 있습니다.</p>
<p>
<b>쿠키 설정 지정<br>
</b>
<br>
사용자는 대개 브라우저 설정을 수정하여 쿠키를 거부할 수 있으며, 쿠키를 거부하거나 사용하지 않도록 브라우저의 설정을 수정하여 언제든지 동의를 철회할 수 있고, 아래에 있는 정보 수집 거부 옵션을 통해 특정 쿠키를 받지 않을 수 있습니다.
모든 쿠키를 거부하도록 선택하면 방문하는 웹 사이트의 일부 기능을 사용하지 못할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p>
<b>웹 분석 사용<br>
<br>
</b>당사는 산업 표준 웹 분석(이하 "웹 분석 제공업체")을 사용하여 당사 사이트에 대한 방문을 추적합니다.
이 쿠키가 생성한 사용자의 당사 사이트 이용 정보(사용자의 IP 주소 포함)는 웹 분석 제공업체에서 자사의 서버에 전송하여 저장합니다.
웹 분석 제공업체는 사용자의 당사 사이트 이용을 평가하고, 웹 사이트 운영자를 위한 웹 사이트 활동 보고서를 제작하며, 웹 사이트 활동 및 인터넷 사용과 관련한 다른 서비스(아래에 구체적으로 설명)를 제공하는 목적으로 이 정보를 사용합니다.
웹 분석 제공업체는 또한 법적으로 요구될 경우나 제3자가 정보를 대신 처리할 경우 이 제3자에게 정보를 전송할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p>당사는 마케팅 전략을 측정, 분석, 최적화하고 사용자가 특별히 관심이 있는 부분에 대한 맞춤식 광고를 제공할 목적으로 다양한 분석 도구를 사용합니다.
특히 다음 도구를 사용합니다.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter, Inc.(이하 "Twitter")의 서비스인 Twitter 광고</b>.
Twitter는 자사의 광고 기술을 통합하여 사용자가 사이트를 이용할 때 직접 정보를 수집합니다.
이 정보에는 브라우저 쿠키 ID, 모바일 장치 ID, 해시된 이메일 주소, 인구 통계 또는 관심 데이터, 사이트에서 본 콘텐츠나 한 행동이 포함됩니다.
아래 링크를 클릭하여 Twitter 광고의 정보 수집을 거부할 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>Twitter 광고 정보 수집 거부 링크</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Google Inc.(이하 "Google")의 서비스인 Google Analytics와 DoubleClick Floodlight</b>.
Google Analytics는 쿠키를 사용하여 사용자의 사이트 이용을 분석합니다.
수집되는 정보에는 IP 주소, 탐색 활동, 사이트 이용에 관련된 기타 데이터가 있습니다.
기타 데이터의 예로는 참조 사이트 세부 정보, 웹 브라우저와 운영 체제의 종류, 외부 링크 클릭, 사이트별 위젯과의 상호 작용 등이 있으며, Google은 보통 이러한 정보를 미국에 있는 서버로 전송하여 저장합니다.
그러나 포털에 적용된 IP 익명화 정책으로 인해 EU(유럽 연합)/EEA(유럽 경제 지역) 회원국 내의 IP 주소(EU/EEA에서 사이트를 탐색할 경우)는 사전에 짧게 줄입니다.
유일한 예외는 전체 IP 주소를 미국의 Google 서버로 전송하고 여기서 줄이는 경우입니다.
Google에 따르면 Google Analytics의 범위 내에서 브라우저가 전송한 IP 주소는 다른 Google 데이터와 병합되지 않습니다.
아래 링크를 클릭하여 Google Analytics의 정보 수집을 거부할 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Analytics 정보 수집 거부 링크</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b>은 디지털 광고를 관리하는 도구입니다.
<b>Floodlight</b>는 웹 사이트 사용자가 광고를 보거나 클릭한 후의 활동을 포착하고 변환하여 보고하며 대상 고객을 설정하여 마케팅 측정과 캠페인을 최적화합니다.
위에서 설명한 방법으로 브라우저 설정을 변경하여 정보 수집을 거부할 수 있습니다.</p>
<p>·         또한 당사의 사이트는 Google의 <b>Google 태그 관리자</b>를 사용하여 하나의 인터페이스로 웹 사이트 태그를 관리합니다.
이 도구(태그 구현)는 자체적으로 (개인) 데이터를 수집할 수 있는 다른 태그를 트리거합니다.
하지만 Google 태그 관리자는 이 데이터에 액세스하지 않습니다.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Hva er en informasjonskapsel? </b>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Informasjonskapsler er tekstfiler som inneholder små mengder informasjon som lastes ned til harddisken eller i nettleserens minne når du besøker en av våre nettsteder.
Informasjonskapsler er nyttige fordi de hjelper til med å ordne innholdet og utformingen av nettstedene våre og tillate oss å gjenkjenne de datamaskinene eller andre enheter som har vært på våre nettsteder før.
Informasjonskapsler gjør mange forskjellige jobber, som gjør at våre nettsteder kan huske dine innstillinger og hjelpe oss med å forbedre brukervennligheten og ytelsen til våre nettsteder og din erfaring når du bruker dem.</p>
<p>Våre nettsteder kan også inneholde noen elektroniske bilder som kalles websignaler (web beacons) – noen ganger kalt enkeltpiksel-gif-er – som gjør det mulig for oss å telle antallet brukere som har besøkt bestemte sider.
Det kan også hende vi legger inn websignaler i e-post med reklame eller i nyhetsbrev for å fastslå om meldinger er blitt åpnet og gjort noe med.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Kategorier av informasjonskapsler og lignende teknologier som vi bruker</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typen informasjonskapsel eller lignende teknologi som kan brukes på våre nettsteder kan deles inn i 1 av 4 kategorier: Strengt nødvendig, ytelse, funksjonalitet og &amp;profil samt reklame.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler</b>
</p>
<p>Disse informasjonskapslene er nødvendige fordi de gjør det mulig for deg å bevege deg rundt på nettstedene våre og bruke funksjonene der, spesielt i forbindelse med informasjonssøk og bestilling.
Uten disse informasjonskapslene kan vi ikke levere tjenestene du ber om.
Disse informasjonskapslene samler ikke informasjon om deg som kan brukes til markedsføring og husker ikke hvor du har vært på Internett.
Eksempler på strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler er en informasjonskapsel for handlekurv som brukes til å huske varene du ønsker å kjøpe når du legger til produkter i handlekurven eller fortsetter til kassen, en innloggings-/autentiseringsinformasjonskapsel som tillater og administrerer innloggingen til nettstedet og identifiserer deg etter at du har logget inn til en enkelt økt, en øktinformasjonskapsel som er nødvendig for å utføre dataoverføring og gi tilgang til nettstedet for deg, en sikkerhetsinformasjonskapsel som oppdager gjentatte mislykkede påloggingsforsøk eller lignende misbruk av nettstedene.
Disse typene informasjonskapsler lagres hovedsakelig bare så lenge det er nødvendig for oppfylle formålet deres.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Ytelsesinformasjonskapsler</b>
</p>
<p>Disse informasjonskapslene samler inn opplysninger om hvordan du bruker nettstedene våre, for eksempel hvilke sider du besøker oftest, og om du får feilmeldinger fra bestemte sider.
Disse informasjonskapslene samler inn informasjon som brukes til å forbedre hvordan våre nettsteder fungerer.
Uten disse informasjonskapslene kan vi ikke lære hvor godt våre nettsteder fungerer og gjøre relevante forbedringer som kan forbedre nettleseropplevelsen din.
Eksempler på ytelseskapsler som nettstedene våre bruker omfatter informasjonskapsler fra Google og Adobe Analytics (se mer informasjon nedenfor).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Informasjonskapsler &amp;for funksjonalitet og profil</b>
</p>
<p>Disse informasjonskapslene gjør det mulig for nettstedene våre å lagre opplysninger som du oppgir, for eksempel innstillinger samt lagre tekniske opplysninger som er nyttige for samhandlingen din med nettstedene våre.
For eksempel husker de bruker-ID-en din og elementene i brukerprofilen din.
De sørger også for at din opplevelse ved bruk av nettstedene er relevant for deg.
De kan også brukes til å yte tjenester du har bedt om, for eksempel å se på en video eller kommentere på en blogg (uten å være en informasjonskapsel som er strengt nødvendig for at nettstedet skal fungere, se kategori 1).
Disse informasjonskapslene vil ikke bli brukt til å spore netteleseraktiviteten din på andre nettsteder.</p>
<p>Uten disse informasjonskapslene kan ikke et nettsted huske dine tidligere valg eller gi deg en personlig tilpasset brukeropplevelse.
Vi bruker for eksempel en informasjonskapsel for å lagre språkinnstillingene dine, noe som lar oss gi deg produktsøksresultater på riktig språk, og vi bruker en informasjonskapsel for å lagre ditt valg om visning av informasjonsbanneret for informasjonskapsler som vi viser på våre nettsteder.
Denne informasjonskapselen vil hjelpe oss med å huske ditt valg om visning av informasjonskapselbanneret når du senere besøker det samme nettstedet hvor du har gjort ditt valg om banneret og andre av selskapets nettsteder med samme domene eller det samme toppnivådomenet.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Markedsføringskapsler og lignende teknologier</b>
</p>
<p>Disse informasjonskapslene eller lignende teknologier kan brukes til å levere annonser som er mer relevante for deg og interessene dine.
De kan også brukes til å begrense antall ganger du ser en annonse samt bidra til å måle annonseringskampanjens effektivitet.
Disse informasjonskapslene kan spore surfingaktiviteten din på andre nettsteder.
Uten disse informasjonskapslene eller andre teknologier vil nettannonsene du ser være mindre relevante for deg og dine interesser.</p>
<p>Vi tillater tredjeparts annonsepartnere (se nedenfor) å bruke informasjonskapsler og annen teknologi for å samle inn informasjon om nettlesingsaktivitetene dine over tid og på forskjellige nettsteder når du bruker webområdene våre, inkludert produkter du ser gjennom eller kjøper samt hvor du befinner deg.
Eksempler på markedsføringskapsler eller lignende teknologier som vi bruker, er Google AdWords og Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Angi innstillinger for informasjonskapsler<br>
</b>
<br>
Du kan vanligvis endre nettleserinnstillingene for å avvise informasjonskapsler, og du kan når som helst trekke samtykket ditt tilbake ved å endre innstillingene til nettleseren din for å avvise eller deaktivere informasjonskapsler eller ved å ekskludere spesifikke informasjonskapsler ved hjelp av alternativene som er oppgitt nedenfor.
Hvis du velger å avslå informasjonskapsler fullstendig, kan det hende du ikke fullt ut kan bruke funksjonene på nettstedene våre du besøker.</p>
<p>
<b>Vår bruk av webanalyse<br>
<br>
</b>Vi bruker bransjestandard webanalyseverktøy for å spore besøk på våre nettsteder ("webanalyseleverandører").
Informasjonen som informasjonskapsler genererer om din bruk av nettstedene våre (inkludert din IP-adresse), blir overført til og lagret av webanalyseleverandører på deres servere.
Webanalyseleverandører vil bruke denne informasjonen for å evaluere din bruk av nettstedene våre, utarbeide rapporter om nettstedsaktivitet for nettstedsoperatører og tilby andre tjenester relatert til nettstedsaktivitet og bruk av Internett (som angitt nedenfor).
Webanalyseleverandører kan også overføre denne informasjonen til tredjeparter når de er pålagt å gjøre dette i henhold til lov, eller når slike tredjeparter behandler informasjonen på deres vegne.</p>
<p>Vi bruker ulike analyseverktøy for å måle, analysere og optimalisere markedsføringstiltak og gi deg tilpassede annonser som kan være av særlig interesse for deg.
Spesielt bruker vi følgende verktøy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising </b>, en tjeneste fra Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter samler inn informasjon direkte om bruken av nettstedene ved å integrere reklameteknologien.
Denne informasjonen omfatter informasjon om nettleserinformasjonskapslene, ID-er for mobilenheter, krypterte e-postadresser, demografiske data eller interessedata og innholdsvisning eller handlinger som er utført på nettstedene.
Du kan velge bort Twitter Advertising ved å følge lenken nedenfor:</li>

<li>
<b>Google Analytics og DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, begge tjenestene er levert av Google Inc.
("Google"):  Google Analytics bruker informasjonskapsler som gjør det mulig å analysere bruken av nettstedene.
Informasjonen som samles inn (IP-adresse, nettleseraktivitet og andre data knyttet til bruken av nettstedene, for eksempel opplysninger om nettstedet du kom fra, nettleser- og operativsystem, klikk på eksterne koblinger, samhandling med nettstedsspesifikke widgeter) overføres vanligvis til en Google-server i USA og lagres der.
På grunn av IP-anonymisering som vi har aktivert på portalen, vil Google imidlertid redusere IP-adressen din i EU/EØS-land på forhånd (hvis du surfer på nettstedet i EU/EØS-sonen).
Bare i unntakstilfeller vil hele IP-adressen bli overført til en Google-server i USA og forkortet der.
Ifølge Google blir ikke IP-adressen som overføres av nettleseren din innenfor rammen av Google Analytics, slått sammen med andre Google-data.
Du kan fravelge Google Analytics ved å følge koblingen nedenfor:</li>

<b>DoubleClick</b> er et verktøy for å administrere digital annonsering.
<b>Floodlight </b>fanger opp og rapporter om konverteringer - aktiviteter fra nettsidebrukere etter at de har sett eller klikket på en annonse – og konfigurerer målgrupper for å optimalisere markedsføringstiltak og kampanjer.
Du kan velge dette bort ved å endre nettleserinnstillingene som beskrevet ovenfor.</p>
<p>·         Videre bruker våre nettsteder <b>Google Tag Manager </b>fra Google, som bidrar til å administrere nettstedskoder gjennom et enkelt grensesnitt.
Verktøyet selv (implementering av koder) utløser andre koder som selv kan samle inn (personlige) opplysninger.
Google Tag Manager har imidlertid ikke tilgang til disse opplysningene.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>Session Cam</b> – nettstedene våre bruker SessionCam for opptak av navigasjonsnettsteder for besøkende for å identifisere bruksproblemer for besøkende.
Besøksinformasjonen samles inn av SessionCam og er anonym og inkluderer ikke noen PII (personlig identifiserbar informasjon).
Som en del av dette registrerer SessionCam musebevegelser, klikk, mobilbevegelser, skjemainndata, rulling.
For å finne ut mer om hvordan SessionCam bruker informasjonskapsler, se personvernerklæringen til SessionCam.
Som individuell bruker kan du velge slik at alle de anonyme nettstedsaktivitene dine ikke blir registrert av SessionCam. Dette kan gjøres ved å klikke her: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
Du blir ført til en side på SessionCam-nettstedet der du kan slå av innspilling på SessionCam ved å klikke på en enkelt knapp.
Hvis du velger å gjøre dette, plasseres en informasjonskapsel i nettleseren din som deretter blir brukt av SessionCam for å indikere at eventuelle besøk fra enheten din ikke blir registrert.
Data samlet inn av denne tjenesten brukes til å forbedre bruken av nettstedet.

Visningen av personlig annonsering er basert på en analyse av bruken av våre nettsteder ved hjelp av informasjonskapsler og sammenlignbare teknologier, for eksempel sporing av piksler, noe som gjør at vi kan identifisere kunder som til slutt konverterer til et prospekt fra en Facebook.com-kampanje.
Dette hjelper oss med å dokumentere effektiviteten av våre markedsføringskampanjer.
Videre gjør tjenesten det mulig å overvåke nettstedaktivitet for å bygge opp publikum slik at vi kan videreformidle kommunikasjon til dem basert på deres besøk på nettstedene.
Vi kjenner ingen personopplysninger i denne sammenhengen før du velger å oppgi dem ved å enten fylle ut et skjema eller kontakte oss på en annen måte.</p>
<p>Du kan finne ut mer om personverninnstillingene i Facebook og dine muligheter til å endre dem under følgende kobling:</p>

<b>Ikke spor</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Enkelte nettlesere kan sende "ikke-spor"-signaler til nettstedene som brukeren kommuniserer med.På grunn av forskjeller i hvordan nettlesere innlemmer og aktiverer denne funksjonen, er det ikke alltid klart om brukerne har til hensikt å overføre disse signalene, eller om de selv er klar over dem.Vi foretar på det nåværende tidspunkt ingen handlinger som respons på disse signalene.</p>

Jesteśmy firmą o zasięgu globalnym.Zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem, korzystając z Witryn lub uzyskując do nich dostęp oraz kontaktując się z nami i przekazując nam swoje dane, Użytkownik potwierdza i wyraża zgodę na to, aby jego dane osobowe mogły być gromadzone, przesyłane do i konsultowane przez Firmę, spółki należące do naszej grupy, dostawców, naszych dystrybutorów i innych partnerów biznesowych i/lub przedstawicieli, zlokalizowanych w krajach znajdujących się poza krajem zamieszkania Użytkownika, w tym, ale nie wyłącznie, w Stanach Zjednoczonych, Meksyku i Indiach.Należy pamiętać, że ochrona prywatności i wymogi prawne, w tym prawa organów władzy do uzyskania dostępu do danych osobowych Użytkownika, w niektórych z tych krajów mogą nie być równoważne z przepisami obowiązującymi w jego kraju zamieszkania.Niemniej jednak, podejmiemy odpowiednie kroki, aby chronić prywatność Użytkownika i zapewnić poziom ochrony danych osobowych porównywalny z tym istniejącym w jego kraju zamieszkania.</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Użytkownicy zlokalizowani na terenie Europejskiego Obszaru Gospodarczego (EOG)</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Tam, gdzie jest to wymagane, wprowadziliśmy odpowiednie zabezpieczenia, wraz ze spółkami należącymi do grupy, dostawcami usług, kontrahentami, dystrybutorami i innymi partnerami biznesowymi oraz przedstawicielami, aby zapewnić odpowiednią ochronę danych osobowych przekazywanych poza granice EOG.Zabezpieczenia te zazwyczaj obejmują standardowe klauzule umowne UE zgodnie z art.
46 ust.
2 ogólnego rozporządzenia o ochronie danych UE (RODO).Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat odpowiednich zabezpieczeń w celu ochrony danych osobowych Użytkownika, należy skontaktować się z nami, korzystając z danych podanych na końcu niniejszego Oświadczenia o ochronie prywatności.</p>
<p>8.    <b>Bezpieczeństwo</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Jesteśmy zobowiązani do ochrony informacji osobistych Użytkownika.<br>
Korzystamy z różnorodnych technologii i procedur zabezpieczających w celu chronienia informacji osobowych Użytkownika przed nieupoważnionym dostępem, wykorzystaniem i ujawnieniem, w tym wdrażając takie środki bezpieczeństwa, jakie mogą być wymagane przez obowiązujące prawo.<br>
Żaden system informacyjny nie może być jednak w 100% bezpieczny, dlatego nie możemy zagwarantować całkowitego bezpieczeństwa danych osobowych Użytkownika.
Ponadto, nie ponosimy odpowiedzialności za bezpieczeństwo informacji przesyłanych do Witryn przez sieci, nad którymi nie sprawujemy kontroli, w tym za Internet i sieci bezprzewodowe.</p>
<p>
<br>
Bezpieczeństwo danych osobowych Użytkownika zależy również od niego samego.W przypadku, gdy udostępnimy Użytkownikowi (lub gdy wybierze on) jego identyfikator i hasło umożliwiające uzyskanie dostępu do Witryn, będzie on odpowiedzialny za zachowanie poufności tychże danych logowania i nieujawnianie ich innym.</p>

<b>Co to jest plik cookie? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pliki cookie są plikami tekstowymi, które zawierają niewielkie ilości informacji i są pobierane na dysk twardy lub zapisywane w pamięci przeglądarki podczas odwiedzania naszych Witryn.
Pliki cookie są przydatne, ponieważ ułatwiają organizację treści oraz układu Witryn oraz pozwalają nam rozpoznawać te komputery i inne urządzenia, które w przeszłości połączyły się z naszymi Witrynami.
Pliki cookie służą wielu różnym celom, np.
umożliwiają naszym Witrynom zapamiętywanie ustawień preferencji użytkownika oraz pomagają usprawniać działanie i przeglądanie naszych Witryn.</p>
<p>Nasze Witryny mogą także zawierać obrazy elektroniczne, inaczej obrazy web beacon, czasem nazywane także jednopikselowymi obrazami gif, które umożliwiają nam zliczanie użytkowników odwiedzających określone strony.
Możemy również umieszczać obrazy web beacon w promocyjnych wiadomościach e-mail lub biuletynach informacyjnych w celu ustalenia, czy wiadomość została otwarta i czy została podjęta czynność, o której informuje.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Kategorie plików cookie i podobne technologie, z których korzystamy</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typy plików cookie lub podobnych technologii, jakie możemy stosować na naszych witrynach, można podzielić na 4 kategorie: niezbędne, związane z wydajnością, funkcjonalnością i profilem oraz reklamami.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Niezbędne pliki cookie</b>
</p>
<p>Te pliki są niezbędne w celu zapewnienia podstawowych funkcjonalności Witryny, ponieważ umożliwiają poruszanie się po naszych Witrynach internetowych i korzystanie z ich opcji, w szczególności w związku z wyszukiwaniem informacji i składaniem zamówień.
Bez tych plików nie można dostarczyć żądanych usług.
Te pliki cookie nie gromadzą informacji o Użytkowniku, jakie mogłyby zostać wykorzystane w celach marketingowych lub w celu zapamiętania odwiedzanych stron w Internecie.
Przykładami bezwzględnie niezbędnych plików cookie są plik cookie koszyka używany do zapamiętywania produktów, które użytkownik chce zakupić podczas dodawania produktów do koszyka lub po przejściu do kasy, plik cookie logowania/uwierzytelniania, który umożliwia zalogowanie się użytkownika Witrynie, zarządza nim oraz identyfikuje użytkownika po zalogowaniu się na jedną sesję, plik cookie sesji, który jest wymagany do wykonania transmisji danych i umożliwienia użytkownikowi korzystania z Witryny internetowej, plik cookie zabezpieczeń, który wykrywa powtarzanie się nieudanych prób logowania lub podobnych nadużyć witryn.
Pliki cookie tych typów są regularnie przechowywane tylko tak długo, jak jest to wymagane celów z nimi związanych.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Pliki cookie związane z wydajnością</b>
</p>
<p>Pliki te gromadzą informacje na temat sposobu korzystania przez Użytkownika z Witryn, np.
najczęściej odwiedzanych stron internetowych, czy komunikatów o błędach wyświetlanych na określonych stronach.
Te pliki cookie zbierają wyłącznie informacje służące optymalizacji działania Witryn.
Bez tych plików cookie nie jesteśmy w stanie ustalić, czy nasze Witryny działają poprawnie, ani wprowadzić odpowiednich ulepszeń, które mogłyby usprawnić ich przeglądanie.
Nasze Witryny korzystają m.in.
z takich plików cookie związanych z wydajnością jak Google i Adobe Analytics (patrz dalsze informacje poniżej).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Pliki cookie związane z funkcjonalnością i profilem</b>
</p>
<p>Te pliki cookie pozwalają naszym Witrynom przechowywać informacje udostępniane przez użytkownika, takie jak preferencje, oraz informacje techniczne przydatne w interakcjach użytkownika z naszymi Witrynami.
Zapamiętują one na przykład identyfikator i elementy profilu użytkownika.
Zapewniają również odpowiednie wrażenia podczas korzystania z Witryn.
Mogą być również wykorzystywane do świadczenia usług, o które prosi użytkownik, takich jak oglądanie wideo lub komentowanie na blogu (nie będąc plikami cookie, które są absolutnie niezbędne do funkcjonowania Witryny, patrz kategoria 1).
Te pliki cookie nie będą używane do celów śledzenia aktywności użytkownika w innych witrynach internetowych.</p>
<p>Bez tych plików cookie witryna nie może zapamiętać wcześniejszych wyborów użytkownika ani spersonalizować jego procesu przeglądania.
Korzystamy z pliku cookie na przykład po to, aby zapisać preferencje językowe użytkownika, co pozwala przedstawić wyniki wyszukiwania produktu w odpowiednim języku, a także w celu zapisania wyboru użytkownika dotyczącego wyglądu banera informującego o plikach cookie na naszych Witrynach.
Takie pliki cookie pomagają nam zapamiętywać wybór użytkownika dotyczący wyglądu banera informującego o plikach cookie na naszych witrynach, gdy po raz kolejny odwiedzi on tę samą witrynę, na której dokonano wyboru co do banera, a także inną witrynę Firmy w tej samej domenie lub tej samej domenie najwyższego poziomu.</p>
<p>

Informacje generowane przez pliki cookie na temat korzystania przez użytkownika z naszych Witryn internetowych (w tym adresów IP Użytkownika) będą przekazywane do naszych Dostawców narzędzi analizy internetowej i przechowywane przez nich na ich serwerach.
Dostawcy narzędzi analizy internetowej będą wykorzystywać te informacje do celów oceny korzystania przez Użytkownika z naszych Witryn internetowych, sporządzania sprawozdań dotyczących aktywności witryn internetowych, by w stosunku do operatorów witryn świadczyć dalsze usługi związane z aktywnością witryny i korzystania z Internetu (w sposób określony poniżej).
Dostawcy narzędzi analizy internetowej mogą również przekazywać te informacje stronom trzecim w sytuacji, gdy wymaga tego prawo, lub w przypadku przetwarzania informacji przez strony trzecie w ich imieniu.</p>
<p>Wykorzystujemy różne narzędzia analityczne, które służą do mierzenia, analizowania i optymalizowania naszych działań marketingowych oraz dostarczania spersonalizowanych reklam, które mogą być dla użytkownika szczególnie interesujące.
Wykorzystujemy w szczególności następujące narzędzia:</p>

szczegóły Witryny, typ przeglądarki internetowej i systemu operacyjnego, kliknięcia łączy zewnętrznych, interakcja z widżetami poszczególnych Witryn) są zwykle przenoszone na serwer Google w Stanach Zjednoczonych i tam przechowywane.
Jednak ze względu na anonimizację IP adresów, którą aktywowaliśmy w portalu, Google skróci adresy IP użytkowników z państw członkowskich Unii Europejskiej/Europejskiego Obszaru Gospodarczego (jeśli przeglądają Witrynę w UE/EOG).
Tylko w wyjątkowych przypadkach pełny adres IP zostanie przesłany na serwer Google w Stanach Zjednoczonych i tam skrócony.
Według Google, adres IP przesłany przez przeglądarkę użytkownika w ramach usługi Google Analytics nie zostanie scalony z innymi danymi Google.

Aceste module cookie nu colectează informaţii despre dumneavoastră care ar putea fi folosite pentru campanii de marketing sau pentru a memora site-urile pe care le-aţi accesat.
Exemple de module cookie strict necesare sunt un modul cookie pentru coșul de cumpărături, care este utilizat pentru a vă aminti produsele pe care doriţi să le cumpăraţi când le adăugaţi în coșul de cumpărături sau treceţi la finalizarea tranzacţiei, un modul cookie pentru conectare/autentificare ce vă permite și gestionează conectarea la Site și vă identifică după ce vă conectaţi pentru prima sesiune, un modul cookie destinat sesiunii care contribuie la transmiterea datelor și vă pune la dispoziţie Site-ul, un modul cookie de securitate care detectează încercările repetate de conectare nereușite sau abuzurile similare ale Site-urilor.

<b>Utilizarea analizelor web<br>
<br>
</b>Utilizăm analize web standard în domeniu pentru a urmări vizitele de pe site-urile noastre („furnizori de analiză web”).
Informaţiile generate de modulele cookie dedicate utilizării Site-urilor noastre (inclusiv adresa dumneavoastră IP) vor fi transmise către și memorate de furnizorii noștri de analiză web, pe serverele acestora.
Furnizorii de analiză web vor folosi aceste informaţii în scopul evaluării modului în care utilizaţi Site-urile noastre, întocmind rapoarte despre activitatea pe site-urile web pentru operatorii acestor site-uri, și asigurând și alte servicii referitoare la activitatea pe site și utilizarea internetului (după cum este specificat mai jos).
Furnizorii de analiză web pot transfera, de asemenea, aceste informaţii către terţe părţi, când acest lucru este impus prin lege sau când terţii respectivi procesează informaţiile în nume propriu.</p>
<p>Utilizăm numeroase instrumente analitice care contribuie la măsurarea, analiza și optimizarea măsurilor noastre de marketing și vă oferim anunţuri personalizate, care v-ar putea interesa în mod deosebit.
Folosim, în special, următoarele instrumente:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Publicitate pe Twitter</b>, serviciul Twitter, Inc.
(„Twitter”).
Prin integrarea tehnologiei sale de publicitate, Twitter colectează informaţii direct în urma utilizării Site-urilor.
Aceste informaţii includ ID-urile modulelor cookie ale browserului, ID-urile dispozitivelor mobile, adresele de e-mail trunchiate, datele demografice sau de interes, precum și conţinutul vizualizat sau acţiunile întreprinse pe Site-uri.

<b>Google Analytics și DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, ambele servicii oferite de Google Inc.
(„Google”): Google Analytics utilizează module cookie care permit o analiză privind utilizarea de către dumneavoastră a Site-urilor.
Informaţiile colectate (adresa IP, activităţile de navigare și alte date legate de utilizarea Site-urilor de către dumneavoastră, de exemplu trimiterea detaliilor site-ului, banda browserului web și sistemul de operare, clicurile pe linkuri externe, interacţiunea cu componentele specifice site-ului) sunt de obicei transferate către un server Google din S.U.A.
și stocate acolo.
Totuși, din cauza anonimizării IP-ului pe care l-am activat pe portal, Google vă va reduce în prealabil adresa IP în statele membre ale Uniunii Europene/Spaţiului Economic European (dacă navigaţi pe Site din UE/SEE).
Doar în cazuri excepţionale, adresa IP completă va fi transmisă unui server Google din S.U.A.
și va fi stocată acolo.
Conform Google, adresa IP transmisă de browserul dumneavoastră în cadrul Google Analytics nu va fi combinată cu alte date Google.

<b>DoubleClick</b> este un instrument pentru gestionarea publicităţii digitale.
<b>Floodlight</b> surprinde și raportează conversiile – activităţile utilizatorilor site-urilor după ce aceștia au văzut sau accesat o reclamă – și stabilește publicul vizat pentru a optimiza măsurile și campaniile de marketing.
Puteţi dezactiva opţiunea modificând setările browserului, conform descrierii de mai sus.</p>
<p>·         Mai mult, Site-urile noastre utilizează <b>Google Tag Manager</b> oferit de Google, care ajută la gestionarea etichetelor site-ului printr-o singură interfaţă.
Instrumentul propriu-zis (implementarea etichetelor) generează alte etichete care pot colecta date cu caracter personal.
Totuși, Google Tag Manager nu accesează datele respective.</p>

<b>Rollworks de la NextRoll</b> - Când vizitatorii ajung pe site-ul nostru web, acesta utilizează instrumente de la terţi (cum este, de exemplu, RollWorks) și poate instala module cookie pe browserele vizitatorilor în scopuri publicitare pe segmente personalizate.
Noi utilizăm aceste date pentru a furniza reclame personalizate în funcţie de experienţa de navigare a fiecărui utilizator.
Informaţiile colectate pot include activitatea înregistrată pe site, adrese de IP și identificatori cookie.

Acesta este un serviciu de remarketing care ne permite să ne adresăm vizitatorilor Site-urile noastre folosind Facebook, prin reclamele pe care le plasăm.
Afișarea publicității personalizate se bazează pe o analiză a utilizării Site-urilor noastre folosind module cookie și tehnologii comparabile, cum ar fi pixeli de urmărire, care ne permit să identificăm clienții care până la urmă generează conversii printr-o campanie de pe Facebook.com.
Acest lucru ne ajută să dovedim eficacitatea campaniilor noastre de marketing.
Mai mult, serviciul ne permite să monitorizăm activitatea site-ului web pentru a crea publicuri țintă, astfel încât să le putem transmite în continuare mesaje pe baza vizitei lor de pe Site-uri.
În acest context, nu vom cunoaște datele cu caracter personal până când nu le oferiți fie completând un formular, fie contactând-ne în alt mod.</p>

</b>Ambele servicii colectează și procesează datele privind utilizarea și interacțiunea, informațiile de contact, adresa IP și datele de localizare.
Folosim LinkedIn Ads pentru a direcționa traficul către Site-uri, difuzând reclame online pe LinkedIn.com care în cele din urmă pot direcționa utilizatorii către Site-uri.
Folosim LinkedIn Analytics pentru a măsura succesul campaniilor noastre publicitare, astfel încât să vedem care dintre utilizatori vor genera până la urmă conversie pe Site-uri.

și instrumentul de măsurare a implicării utilizatorilor, <b>Marketo</b>, oferit de Marketo Inc.
AddThis este un instrument de partajare socială utilizat pe site-urile din cadrul articolelor noastre de știri.
Acesta poate colecta date de pe Site-uri utilizând un modul cookie destinat prestării serviciului de vizare pe care îl folosim pentru a ne îmbunătăți serviciile și a oferi publicitate personalizată.
Datele prelucrate de AddThis includ ID-uri unice (de exemplu, ID-ul modulului cookie), adresa IP, locația geografică, informații despre dispozitiv, cum ar fi tipul browserului și al dispozitivului, sistemul de operare și limba preferată, data și ora la care ne-ați accesat Site-urile, adresa URL pentru recomandare.</p>

<b>Nu urmări</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
Unele browsere web pot transmite semnale „nu urmări” către Site-urile cu care comunică utilizatorul.
Deoarece diferite browsere web încorporează şi activează această caracteristică în mod diferit, nu este întotdeauna evident dacă utilizatorul intenţionează ca aceste semnale să fie transmise, sau dacă are măcar cunoştinţă despre aceste semnale.
În acest moment, nu întreprindem nicio acţiune ca răspuns la aceste semnale.</p>

<b>Что такое файлы cookie? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Файлы cookie — это текстовые файлы, содержащие небольшое количество информации, которые загружаются на ваш жесткий диск или в память браузера при посещении одного из наших сайтов.
Файлы cookie полезны, так как они помогают упорядочивать содержимое и структуру наших сайтов и позволяют распознавать компьютеры и другие устройства, с которых пользователи уже заходили на сайты ранее.
Эти файлы выполняют множество различных функций, например, позволяют нашим сайтам запоминать ваши предпочтения и помогают нам повышать удобство использования, увеличивать производительность сайтов и упрощать ваше взаимодействие с ними.</p>
<p>Наши сайты также могут содержать электронные изображения, известные как сетевые маячки, иногда называемые «однопиксельные GIF-файлы» (single-pixel gifs), которые позволяют нам считать количество пользователей, посетивших эти страницы.
Мы можем также включать сетевые маячки в наши рекламные сообщения или информационные бюллетени, рассылаемые по электронной почте, чтобы определить, было ли сообщение открыто и проследовали ли вы по содержащимся в нем ссылкам.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Категории файлов cookie и других аналогичных технологий, которые мы используем</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии, используемые на наших сайтах, могут относиться к 1 из 4 категорий.
строго необходимые файлы.
файлы, отвечающие за производительность.
файлы, отвечающие за функциональность и конфигурацию.
и рекламные файлы.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Строго необходимые файлы cookie</b>
</p>
<p>Эти файлы cookie необходимы для обеспечения функционирования сайта, так как позволяют вам перемещаться по нашим сайтам и пользоваться их возможностями, особенно при поиске информации и размещении заказов.
Без подобных файлов cookie запрошенные вами услуги не могут быть предоставлены.
Они не используются для сбора информации, которая может быть использована в маркетинговых целях, и для фиксации истории ваших действий в Интернете.
Примерами строго необходимых файлов cookie являются файл cookie для корзины покупок: он используется для запоминания продуктов, которые вы добавили в свою корзину, и при переходе к оформлению заказа.
файл cookie для входа в систему / проверки подлинности, который управляет вашим входом в систему и идентифицирует вас после входа в систему.
файл cookie сеанса, который необходим для осуществления передачи данных и предоставления вам возможностей и сервисов сайта.
файл cookie безопасности, который обнаруживает повторяющиеся неудачные попытки входа в систему и другие нарушения при пользовании сайтами.
Эти типы файлов cookie хранятся ровно столько времени, сколько требуется для выполнения их назначения.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Файлы cookie, отвечающие за производительность</b>
</p>
<p>Такие файлы cookie собирают информацию об использовании наших веб-сайтов, например о том, какие страницы вы чаще всего посещаете, а также о наличии сообщений об ошибках на отдельных страницах.
Они собирают только информацию, которая используется для улучшения работы сайтов.
Без них мы не сможем узнать, как функционируют сайты, и выполнить соответствующие улучшения, чтобы повысить удобство их использования.
Используемые нами файлы cookie, отвечающие за производительность, включают файлы cookie от Google и Adobe Analytics (см.
информацию ниже).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Файлы cookie, отвечающие за функциональность и конфигурацию</b>
</p>
<p>Эти файлы cookie позволяют хранить информацию, предоставляемую вами, например предпочтительные настройки и техническую информацию, полезную для вашего взаимодействия с нашими сайтами.
Например, они помнят ваши имя пользователя и элементы профиля пользователя.
Они также обеспечивают оптимальный для вас режим работы сайтов.
Эти файлы cookie могут также использоваться для предоставления запрашиваемых вами услуг, таких как просмотр видео и комментирование в блоге (при этом они не относятся к файлам cookie, строго необходимым для функционирования сайта, см.
категорию 1).
Они не отслеживают вашу активность на других веб-сайтах.</p>
<p>Без этих файлов cookie веб-сайт не может запомнить сделанный вами выбор или персонализировать ваш доступ к ресурсам.
Например, мы используем файл cookie для хранения ваших языковых предпочтений, позволяющих нам предоставлять вам результаты поиска продукта на вашем языке, а также указанного вами внешнего вида информационного баннера с cookie, который отображается на наших сайтах.
Эти файлы cookie помогают нам запомнить выбранный вами внешний вид информационного баннера с cookie, когда вы снова посещаете тот же сайт, на котором сделали выбор относительно этого баннера, или любой другой сайт компании в том же домене или в том же домене верхнего уровня.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Рекламные файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии</b>
</p>
<p>Такие файлы cookie или аналогичные технологии могут использоваться для показа рекламных сообщений, которые могут быть вам интересны.
Кроме того, они могут использоваться для ограничения времени отображения рекламы, а также помогают оценивать эффективность рекламных кампаний.
Они могут отслеживать вашу активность на других веб-сайтах.
Без этих файлов cookie и аналогичных технологий интернет-реклама, которая попадается вам, будет меньше соответствовать вашим интересам.</p>
<p>Мы разрешаем сторонним партнерам по рекламе (см.
далее) использовать файлы cookie и другие технологии для сбора информации о вашей активности в разные промежутки времени и на разных веб-сайтах, когда вы используете наши сайты, включая продукты, которые вы просматриваете или приобретаете, и ваше местоположение.
Примеры используемых нами рекламных файлов cookie и аналогичных технологий включают Google AdWords и Facebook Pixels.</p>

<p>
<b>Использование данных веб-аналитики<br>
<br>
</b>Для отслеживания посещаемости наших сайтов мы используем стандартные средства веб-аналитики (Поставщики услуг веб-аналитики).
Информация о посещениях наших сайтов, сгенерированная файлами cookie (включая ваш IP-адрес), передается нашим поставщикам услуг веб-аналитики и хранится на их серверах.
Поставщики услуг веб-аналитики используют данную информацию в целях оценки посещений наших сайтов, создания отчетов об активности на веб-сайтах для их администраторов и предоставления иных услуг, связанных с активностью на веб-сайтах и использованием сети Интернет (как указано далее).
Поставщики услуг веб-аналитики также имеют право передавать данную информацию третьим лицам, если этого требует законодательство, или если данные третьи лица занимаются обработкой подобной информации в их интересах.</p>
<p>Мы используем различные инструменты аналитики, которые служат для измерения, анализа и оптимизации наших маркетинговых шагов и предоставляют вам персонализированные рекламные объявления, которые могут представлять для вас особый интерес.
В частности, мы используем следующие инструменты:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, сервис компании Twitter, Inc.
(Twitter).
Twitter собирает информацию непосредственно в ходе использования Сайтов путем интеграции в них своих рекламных технологий.
Собираемая информация включает в себя идентификаторы файлов cookie браузера, идентификаторы мобильных устройств, хeшированные адреса электронной почты, демографические данные или данные об интересах, а также сведения о просмотренном контенте или действиях, предпринятых на сайтах.

<b>Google Analytics и DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, сервисы компании Google Inc.
(Google): Google Analytics использует файлы cookie, которые позволяют анализировать использование вами наших сайтов.
Собранная информация (IP-адрес, действия в браузере и другие данные, связанные с использованием сайтов, например, сведения о ссылающихся сайтах, тип веб-браузера и операционной системы, переходы по внешним ссылкам, взаимодействие с виджетами сайта) обычно передается на сервер Google в США и хранится там.
Однако из-за анонимизации IP-адреса, которую мы используем на портале, Google сначала сократит ваш IP-адрес в государствах-членах Европейского союза / Европейской экономической зоны (если вы просматриваете сайт в ЕС/ЕЭЗ).
Только в исключительных случаях полный IP-адрес будет передаваться на сервер Google в США и сокращаться там.
Компания Google утверждает, что IP-адрес, передаваемый вашим браузером в рамках Google Analytics, не будет объединяться с другими данными Google.

<b>DoubleClick</b> — это инструмент для управления цифровой рекламой.
<b>Floodlight</b> обнаруживает конверсии, сообщает о них — речь идет о действиях пользователей сайта после того, как они просмотрели или щелкнули рекламу — и определяет целевую аудиторию для оптимизации маркетинговых мероприятий и кампаний.
Вы можете отказаться от сервиса, изменив настройки браузера, как описано выше.</p>
<p>·         Кроме того, наши сайты используют сервис <b>Google Tag Manager</b> от Google, который помогает управлять тегами сайта через единый интерфейс.
Этот инструмент (внедряющий теги) запускает другие теги, которые могут сами собирать (личные) данные.
Однако Google Tag Manager не имеет доступа к этим данным.</p>
<p>

<b>Session Cam</b> – наши сайты используют SessionCam для создания записей навигации посетителей сайта с целью выявления проблем с удобством пользования для наших посетителей.
Информация о посетителях, собранная SessionCam, является анонимной и не включает персональные данные (данные, позволяющие идентифицировать личность).
Для этого SessionCam записывает движения мыши, щелчки, мобильные жесты, форму ввода, действия прокрутки.
Чтобы узнать подробнее о том, как Session Cam использует файлы cookie, ознакомьтесь с политикой конфиденциальности SessionCam.
Будучи индивидуальным пользователем, вы можете отказаться от регистрации SessionCam всех ваших анонимных действий на веб-сайте.Это можно сделать, нажав здесь: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded.

<b>Не отслеживать</b>
</p>
<p>Некоторые браузеры могут передавать сигналы о запрете на сбор информации о перемещениях пользователя («Do-Not-Track») на сайты, с которыми он взаимодействует.
Из-за различий в способах включения и активации этой функции в браузерах не всегда понятно, действительно ли пользователи хотят передать этот сигнал и знают ли они вообще о существовании такой возможности.
На данный момент мы не предпринимаем никаких действий в ответ на эти сигналы.</p>

<b>Čo je súbor cookie? </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Súbory cookie sú textové súbory obsahujúce malé množstvá informácií, ktoré sa sťahujú na váš pevný disk alebo do pamäte prehliadača, keď navštívite niektorú z našich webových lokalít.
Súbory cookie sú užitočné, pretože pomáhajú usporiadať obsah a rozloženie našich webových lokalít a umožňujú nám rozpoznať počítače a ďalšie zariadenia, ktoré sa v minulosti pripojili k našim webovým lokalitám.
Súbory cookie slúžia na mnoho rôznych účelov, napríklad umožňujú našim webovým lokalitám zapamätať si vaše nastavenia predvolieb, pomáhajú nám zlepšovať použiteľnosť a výkonnosť našich webových lokalít a možnosti ich používania.</p>
<p>Naše webové lokality môžu obsahovať aj elektronické obrázky nazývané webové majáky (niekedy tiež jednopixelové súbory GIF), ktoré nám umožňujú spočítať, koľko používateľov navštívilo konkrétne stránky.
Webové majáky môžeme zahrnúť aj do propagačných e-mailových správ alebo bulletinov s cieľom zistiť, či boli správy otvorené a či sa s nimi vykonali príslušné činnosti.</p>

<b>Kategórie súborov cookie a podobných technológií, ktoré používame</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Súbory cookie a iné obdobné technológie používané na našich webových lokalitách možno rozdeliť do štyroch kategórií: nevyhnutne potrebné, výkonnostné, funkčné a profilové a napokon reklamné.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Nevyhnutne potrebné súbory cookie</b>
</p>
<p>Tieto súbory cookie sú nevyhnutne potrebné pre základné funkcie webových lokalít.
Umožňujú vám prezerať si naše webové lokality a používať ich funkcie, a to najmä v súvislosti s vyhľadávaním informácií a zadávaním objednávok.
Bez týchto súborov cookie nemožno poskytovať služby, o ktoré požiadate.
Tieto súbory cookie nezhromažďujú údaje o vás, ktoré by mohli byť použité na marketingové účely alebo ukladanie informácií o tom, ktoré internetové stránky ste navštívili.
Medzi príklady nevyhnutne potrebných súborov cookie patria súbor cookie nákupného košíka, ktorý sa používa na ukladanie informácií o produktoch, ktoré ste pridali do svojho nákupného košíka, pretože si ich chcete kúpiť alebo chcete prejsť k pokladni, prihlasovací/overovací súbor cookie, ktorý umožňuje a spravuje vaše prihlásenie k webovej lokalite a identifikuje vás po prihlásení počas jednej relácie, súbor cookie relácie potrebný na prenos údajov a poskytovanie funkcií webovej lokality a súbor cookie zabezpečenia, ktorý deteguje opakované neúspešné pokusy o prihlásenie alebo podobné zneužívanie webových lokalít.
Tieto typy súborov cookie sa zvyčajne ukladajú iba dovtedy, kým je to potrebné na splnenie ich účelu.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Výkonnostné súbory cookie</b>
</p>
<p>Tieto súbory cookie zhromažďujú informácie o vašom používaní našich webových lokalít, napríklad o tom, aké stránky navštevujete najčastejšie a či sa vám na určitých stránkach zobrazia nejaké chybové hlásenia.
Tieto súbory cookie zhromažďujú údaje používané na zlepšovanie činnosti našich webových lokalít.
Bez týchto súborov cookie nemôžeme zistiť, ako dobre fungujú naše webové lokality, aby sme mohli príslušne vylepšiť ich prezeranie.
Príkladmi výkonnostných súborov cookie, ktoré používame na našich webových lokalitách, sú súbory cookie služieb Google a Adobe Analytics (pozrite si ďalšie informácie uvedené nižšie).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Funkčné a profilové súbory cookie</b>
</p>
<p>Tieto súbory cookie umožňujú našim webovým lokalitám ukladať informácie, ktoré nám poskytnete, napríklad vaše predvoľby, a ukladať technické údaje, ktoré sú užitočné na vaše interakcie s našimi webovými lokalitami.
Napríklad ukladajú váš identifikátor používateľa a prvky vášho používateľského profilu.
Tiež zaručujú, aby ste mohli používať naše webové lokality prispôsobené pre vás.
Môžu sa používať aj na poskytovanie služieb, o ktoré ste požiadali, napr.
sledovanie videa alebo komentovanie blogu (nie sú to súbory cookie nevyhnutne potrebné na fungovanie webovej lokality – pozrite si kategóriu 1).
Tieto súbory cookie neslúžia na sledovanie vašej aktivity na iných webových lokalitách.</p>
<p>Bez týchto súborov cookie si webová lokalita nemôže zapamätať vami vykonané voľby ani vám nemôže prispôsobiť možnosti jej prezerania.
Do súboru cookie napríklad ukladáme vaše jazykové predvoľby, čo nám umožňuje poskytovať vám výsledky vyhľadávania produktov v správnom jazyku.
Do súboru cookie ukladáme aj vašu voľbu zobrazovania informačného bannera o súboroch cookie, ktorý zobrazujeme na našich webových lokalitách.
Vďaka tomuto súboru cookie si pamätáme vašu voľbu zobrazovania informačného bannera o súboroch cookie pri vašich ďalších návštevách rovnakej webovej lokality, na ktorej ste vykonali danú voľbu zobrazovania bannera, ako aj všetkých ďalších webových lokalít našej spoločnosti v rovnakej doméne alebo v rovnakej doméne najvyššej úrovne.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Reklamné súbory cookie a podobné technológie</b>
</p>
<p>Tieto súbory cookie a podobné technológie môžu slúžiť na zobrazovanie reklám, ktoré lepšie zodpovedajú vám a vašim záujmom.
Môžu sa tiež používať na obmedzenie časov, v ktorých sa vám zobrazuje reklama, a tiež môžu pomôcť merať efektívnosť reklamnej kampane.
Tieto súbory cookie môžu sledovať vaše návštevy iných webových lokalít.
Bez týchto súborov cookie alebo iných technológií budú zobrazované online reklamy menej zodpovedať vám a vašim záujmom.</p>
<p>Externým reklamným partnerom (pozrite nižšie) povoľujeme používanie súborov cookie a iných technológií umožňujúcich pri vašom používaní našich webových lokalít zhromažďovať informácie o vašich aktivitách prezerania webových stránok vykonávaných postupom času a v rámci rôznych webových lokalít vrátane prezeraných produktov, nákupov a vašej polohy.
Medzi príklady reklamných súborov cookie a podobných technológií, ktoré používame, patria Google AdWords a Facebook Pixels.</p>

<p>
<b>Naše používanie služieb webových analýz<br>
<br>
</b>Na sledovanie návštev našich webových lokalít používame štandardné služby webových analýz (ďalej len „poskytovatelia webových analýz“).
Informácie generované prostredníctvom súboru cookie o vašom používaní našich webových lokalít (vrátane vašej adresy IP) sa budú prenášať k našim poskytovateľom webových analýz a uchovávať na ich serveroch.
Poskytovatelia webových analýz budú používať tieto údaje na účely vyhodnocovania vášho používania našich webových lokalít, na zostavovanie správ o aktivitách na webových lokalitách pre ich prevádzkovateľov a na poskytovanie ďalších služieb súvisiacich s aktivitami na webových lokalitách a používaním internetu (uvedených nižšie).
Poskytovatelia webových analýz môžu tieto údaje prenášať aj k tretím stranám, ak to vyžadujú platné právne predpisy alebo ak tieto tretie strany spracúvajú údaje v ich mene.</p>
<p>Používame rôzne analytické nástroje, ktoré slúžia na meranie, analýzu a optimalizáciu našich marketingových opatrení a poskytujú vám prispôsobené reklamy, ktoré by vás mohli zaujímať.
Používame najmä tieto nástroje:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, služba spoločnosti Twitter, Inc.
(ďalej len „spoločnosť Twitter“).
Spoločnosť Twitter zhromažďuje informácie priamo z používania našich webových lokalít integráciou svojej reklamnej technológie.
Tieto informácie zahŕňajú identifikátory súborov cookie prehliadača, identifikátory mobilných zariadení, hašované e-mailové adresy, demografické údaje alebo údaje o záujmoch a obsah zobrazený na našich webových lokalitách alebo akcie vykonané na týchto lokalitách.

<b>Google Analytics a DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, služby spoločnosti Google Inc.
(ďalej len „spoločnosť Google“): Google Analytics používa súbory cookie, ktoré umožňujú analýzu vášho používania našich webových lokalít.
Zhromaždené informácie (adresa IP, aktivity prezerania a ďalšie údaje súvisiace s vaším používaním našich webových lokalít, napr.
podrobnosti o odkazujúcej webovej lokalite, typ webového prehliadača a operačného systému, kliknutia na externé prepojenia, interakcie s miniaplikáciami špecifickými pre webovú lokalitu) sa zvyčajne prenesú na server spoločnosti Google v USA a uložia sa tam.
Z dôvodu anonymizácie adries IP, ktorú sme aktivovali na portáli, však spoločnosť Google predtým zredukuje vašu adresu IP v rámci členských štátov Európskej únie alebo Európskeho hospodárskeho priestoru (ak si našu webovú lokalitu prezeráte v EÚ/EHP).
Len vo výnimočných prípadoch sa na server spoločnosti Google v USA prenesie úplná adresa IP, ktorá sa tam skráti.
Podľa spoločnosti Google sa adresa IP, ktorú váš prehliadač prenáša v rámci služby Google Analytics, nespojí s inými údajmi, ktoré má spoločnosť Google k dispozícii.

<b>DoubleClick</b> je nástroj na správu digitálnej reklamy.
<b>Floodlight</b> zachytáva konverzie a vytvára správy o konverziách – aktivitách používateľov webových lokalít potom, ako videli reklamu alebo na ňu klikli, a vytvára cieľové publiká s cieľom optimalizovať marketingové opatrenia a kampane.
Používanie tejto služby môžete zakázať tak, že zmeníte nastavenia prehliadača, ako je uvedené vyššie.</p>
<p>·         Naše webové lokality navyše používajú <b>Správcu značiek Google</b> od spoločnosti Google, ktorý pomáha spravovať značky na webových lokalitách prostredníctvom jedného rozhrania.
Samotný nástroj (ktorý implementuje značky) spúšťa ďalšie značky, ktoré môžu zhromažďovať (osobné) údaje.
Správca značiek Google však k týmto údajom nemá prístup.</p>

Táto remarketingová služba nám umožňuje zobrazovať na Facebooku naše reklamy návštevníkom našich webových lokalít.
Zobrazovanie prispôsobených reklám je založené na analýze používania našich webových lokalít pomocou súborov cookie a porovnateľných technológií, ako sú napríklad sledovacie pixely, ktoré nám umožňujú identifikovať zákazníkov, ktorí sa nakoniec zmenia na potenciálnych zákazníkov prostredníctvom kampane na webovej lokalite Facebook.com.
Pomáha nám to overovať efektívnosť našich marketingových kampaní.

<b>Categorías de cookies y tecnologías similares que utilizamos</b>
</li>
</ul>

Estos tipos de cookies se almacenan frecuentemente solo el tiempo que sea necesario para su finalidad.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Cookies de rendimiento</b>

Por ejemplo, usamos una cookie para almacenar sus preferencias de idioma, lo que nos permite mostrarle los resultados de búsqueda de un producto, y otra distinta para almacenar sus preferencias sobre la aparición del banner de información sobre cookies que mostramos en nuestros Sitios.
Esta cookie nos ayudará a recordar sus preferencias sobre la aparición del banner cada vez que visite el mismo sitio donde eligió la opción sobre el banner y en cualquier otro sitio de la Empresa del mismo dominio o del mismo dominio de nivel superior.</p>

</p>
<p>
<br>
I de fall där tillämplig lagstiftning kräver det, kommer vi att säkerställa att laglig grund finns för bearbetningen av dina personuppgifter.I de flesta fall kommer den lagliga grunden utgöras av att:</p>
<p>·       bearbetningen är nödvändig för att säkra prestandan hos de tjänster vi tillhandahåller<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>·       bearbetningen är nödvändig för efterlevnaden av lagkrav, inklusive efterlevnaden av tillämplig lagstiftning, regler, begäranden från statliga och halvstatliga organisationer, domstolsbeslut eller stämningar<br>

</p>
<p>Vi kan, i enlighet med tillämplig lagstiftning, anonymisera dina personuppgifter så att de inte längre kan användas för att identifiera dig.Anonymiserad information anses inte utgöra personuppgifter och omfattas därför inte av den här sekretesspolicyn.Vi kan samla in, använda och dela anonymiserad information för alla tänkbara syften.</p>
<p>5.    <b>Tiden för lagring av information</b>
</p>
<p>Hur länge vi lagrar dina personuppgifter varierar beroende på syftet med bearbetningen.Vi lagrar till exempel de personuppgifter som är nödvändiga för att kunna tillhandahålla produkter och tjänster till dig samt för att underlätta begärda transaktioner så länge du är kund hos företaget.Vi lagrar dina personuppgifter för användning i marknadsföringssyfte ända till dess att du, enligt tillämplig lagstiftning, har avanmält dig från att få ytterligare direkt marknadskommunikation.Om du skickar en anställningsansökan via våra webbplatser lagrar vi informationen i din ansökan enligt innehållet i den sekretesspolicy eller de andra meddelanden som visas i samband med att du gör din ansökan, eller enligt tillämplig lagstiftning.I alla övriga fall lagrar vi dina personuppgifter under den tid som krävs för att uppfylla de syften som beskrivs i den här sekretesspolicyn.
När dina personuppgifter inte längre behövs anonymiserar vi dem (där tillämplig lagstiftning medger detta), raderar eller förstör dem.</p>
<p>6.    <b>Utlämnande av information</b>

<br>
</p>
<p>·       <b>Utlämnande av uppgifter av andra orsaker. </b>Vi kan lämna ut personuppgifter om så krävs enligt lag, om vi har rätt att göra det enligt lag eller om det sker i tron att det är nödvändigt för att uppfylla rättsliga krav eller följa rättsliga beslut, för att skydda och försvara våra rättigheter eller egendom eller för att skydda någon individs personliga säkerhet under omständigheter som kräver särskild skyndsamhet.</p>
<p>7.    <b>Internationella överföringar</b>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Användare i Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet (EES)</b>
</p>
<p>Vi har, där detta krävs, infört lämpliga säkerhetsåtgärder för våra koncernbolag, tjänstleverantörer, underleverantörer, distributörer och andra affärspartner och agenter för att se till att överföringar av personuppgifter till länder utanför EES har ett lämpligt skydd.Dessa säkerhetsåtgärder omfattar oftast EU:s standardavtalsklausuler enligt artikel 46(2) i EU:s allmänna dataskyddsförordning.Kontakta oss via kontaktuppgifterna i slutet av den här sekretesspolicyn för att få mer information om de säkerhetsåtgärder vi använder för att skydda dina personuppgifter.</p>
<p>8.    <b>Säkerhet</b>
</p>
<p>Vi strävar efter att skydda dina personuppgifter.<br>
Vi använder flera olika säkerhetstekniker och säkerhetsrutiner för att förhindra obehörig åtkomst till, användning eller utlämnande av dina personuppgifter.
Det omfattar till exempel implementeringen av de säkerhetsåtgärder som kan krävas enligt tillämplig lagstiftning.<br>
Eftersom inga informationssystem kan vara hundraprocentigt säkra kan vi inte garantera att dina personuppgifter är absolut säkra.
Vi är inte heller ansvariga för säkerheten för den information du överför till våra webbplatser via nätverk som inte står under vår kontroll, till exempel Internet och trådlösa nätverk.</p>
<p>
<br>
Ditt eget agerande kan dessutom påverka säkerheten för dina personuppgifter.I de fall vi har gett dig (eller du själv har valt) ett användar-id och lösenord till våra webbplatser är du ansvarig för att se till att dessa inloggningsuppgifter förblir konfidentiella och inte avslöjas för andra.</p>

<p>Cookies är textfiler som innehåller små mängder information och som laddas ned till din hårddisk eller webbläsarens minne när du besöker en av våra webbplatser.
Cookies ger oss möjlighet att hantera innehållet och layouten på våra webbplatser, och identifiera datorer och andra enheter som har besökt webbplatserna tidigare.
Cookies har flera olika uppgifter.
De används till exempel för att våra webbplatser ska komma ihåg dina inställningar och hjälper oss förbättra webbplatsernas användbarhet och prestanda, och din upplevelse när du besöker dem.</p>
<p>Våra webbplatser kan även innehålla elektroniska bilder, så kallade webbfyrar eller pixeltaggar, som gör det möjligt att räkna antalet användare som har besökt olika sidor.
Vi kan också lägga in webbfyrar i e-postmeddelanden med reklammaterial eller nyhetsbrev så att vi kan se om meddelandena har öppnats och lett till någon åtgärd.</p>

<li>
<b>Olika kategorier av cookies och liknande tekniker vi använder</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>De typer av cookies och liknande tekniker som kan användas på våra webbplatser tillhör någon av följande fyra kategorier: Strikt nödvändig, Prestanda, Funktion &amp.
profil och Reklam.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Strikt nödvändiga cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Strikt nödvändiga cookies är en förutsättning för webbplatsens grundläggande funktionalitet.
De gör det möjligt för användaren att navigera och använda funktionerna på den, framförallt för att söka efter information och göra beställningar.
Utan den här typen av cookies kan tjänster som du efterfrågar inte tillhandahållas.
Den här typen av cookies samlar inte in information om dig som kan användas i marknadsföringssyften eller för att komma ihåg var du har varit på Internet.
Exempel på strikt nödvändiga cookies är en varukorgscookie som används för att komma ihåg vilka produkter du vill köpa när du lägger till produkter i din varukorg eller fortsätter till kassan, en inloggnings- / autentiseringscookie som tillåter och hanterar din inloggning till webbplatsen och identifierar dig efter att du har loggat in för en session, en sessionscookie som krävs för att utföra dataöverföring och tillhandahålla webbplatsen till dig, en säkerhetscookie som upptäcker upprepade misslyckade inloggningsförsök eller liknande missbruk av webbplatser.
Dessa typer av cookies lagras regelbundet endast så länge som krävs för deras syfte.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Prestandacookies</b>
</p>
<p>Prestandacookies samlar in information om hur du använder våra webbplatser, till exempel vilka sidor du oftast går till, och om du får felmeddelanden från vissa sidor.
Den här typen av cookies samlar in information som används för att förbättra funktionen hos våra webbplatser.
Utan prestandacookies kan vi inte få information om våra webbplatsers prestanda och göra relevanta förbättringar som kan ge dig en bättre webbupplevelse.
Exempel på prestandacookies som vi använder på våra webbplatser är cookies från Google och Adobe Analytics (se mer information nedan).</p>
<p>
<b>3.    Cookies för funktioner &amp.
profiler:</b>
</p>
<p>Med hjälp av funktions- och profilcookies kan uppgifter som du tillhandahåller, till exempel olika inställningar, lagras på våra webbplatser liksom teknisk information som är till hjälp vid din interaktion med webbplatserna.
De lagrar till exempel ditt användar-id och delar av din användarprofil.
De ser även till att upplevelsen på webbplatsen är relevant för dig.
De kan också användas för att tillhandahålla tjänster som du har bett om, till exempel att titta på en video eller kommentera en blogg (utan att vara en cookie som är absolut nödvändig för att webbplatsen ska fungera, se kategori 1).
Dessa cookies används inte för att spåra din aktivitet på andra webbplatser.</p>
<p>Utan dem kan en webbplats inte komma ihåg val som du gjort tidigare eller anpassa din webbupplevelse.
Vi använder till exempel en cookie för att lagra din språkinställning så att vi kan visa resultaten från produktsökningar på rätt språk och en annan cookie för att lagra om du vill att den banderoll med cookieinformation som finns på våra webbplatser ska visas.
Den cookien hjälper oss att komma ihåg ditt val angående visningen av banderollen med cookieinformation nästa gång du besöker samma webbplats eller någon annan av företagets webbplatser med samma domän eller toppnivådomän.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Reklamcookies och liknande tekniker</b>
</p>
<p>Reklamcookies eller liknande tekniker kan användas för att visa annonser som är mer relevanta för dig och dina intressen.
De kan även användas för att begränsa antalet gånger en annons visas för dig och för att mäta hur effektiv en reklamkampanj är.
Dessa cookies kan spåra dina besök på andra webbplatser.
Utan den här typen av cookies och liknande tekniker blir den onlinereklam som visas mindre relevant för dig och dina intressen.</p>
<p>Vi tillåter fristående annonseringspartner (se nedan) att använda cookies och andra tekniker för att samla in information om dina webbaktiviteter över tid och på olika webbplatser när du använder våra webbplatser, till exempel information om vilka produkter du söker efter eller köper samt din plats.
Några exempel på reklamcookies eller liknande tekniker vi använder är Google AdWords och Facebook Pixels.</p>
<p>
<b>Ange cookieinställningar<br>
</b>
<br>
Du kan vanligtvis ändra dina webbläsarinställningar för att avvisa cookies och du kan när som helst dra tillbaka ditt samtycke genom att ändra inställningarna för din webbläsare för att avvisa eller inaktivera cookies eller genom att välja specifika cookies genom de alternativ som meddelas nedan.
Om du väljer att avböja användningen av cookies helt och hållet kan du eventuellt inte använda alla funktioner på våra webbplatser eller andra webbplatser du besöker.</p>
<p>
<b>Vår användning av webbanalyser<br>
<br>
</b>Vi använder webbanalyser av branschstandardtyp för att spåra besökare på våra webbplatser (“leverantörer av webbanalyser”).
Den information som genereras av cookien om hur du använder våra webbplatser (inklusive din IP-adress) överförs till och lagras av våra leverantörer av webbanalyser på deras servrar.
Våra leverantörer av webbanalyser använder informationen i syfte att utvärdera din användning av våra webbplatser, sammanställa rapporter om webbplatsaktiviteter för webbplatsoperatörer och tillhandahålla andra tjänster som är kopplade till webbplatsaktiviteter och Internetanvändning (se nedan).
Leverantörerna av webbanalyser kan även överföra informationen till tredje man om så krävs enligt lag, eller om tredje man bearbetar informationen för deras räkning.</p>
<p>Vi använder olika analytiska verktyg som tjänar syftet att mäta, analysera och optimera våra marknadsföringsåtgärder och visa anpassade annonser som kan vara av särskilt intresse för dig.
I synnerhet använder vi följande verktyg:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, tjänst från Twitter, Inc.
("Twitter").
Twitter samlar in information direkt från användningen av webbplatser genom att integrera sin reklamteknik.
I informationen ingår webbläsarcookie-ID, mobilenhets-ID, hash-e-postadresser, demografiska eller räntedata och innehåll som visats eller åtgärder som vidtagits på webbplatserna.
Du kan välja bort Twitter Advertising genom att följa länken nedan:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Google Analytics och DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, båda tjänsterna från Google Inc.
("Google"): Google Analytics använder cookies som möjliggör en analys av din webbplatsanvändning.
Den information som samlas in (IP-adress, webbläsningsaktiviteter och andra uppgifter som är kopplade till din användning av webbplatserna, t.ex.
hänvisningswebbplats, webbläsare och operativsystem, klick på externa länkar, interaktion med webbplatsspecifika widgets) överförs vanligtvis till en Google-server i USA och lagras där.
På grund av den IP-anonymisering som vi har aktiverat på portalen kommer Google på förhand att reducera din IP-adress inom EU / Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet (om du surfar på webbplatsen i EU / EES).
Endast i undantagsfall kommer hela IP-adressen att skickas till en Google-server i USA och förkortas där.
Enligt Google kommer inte IP-adressen som överförs av din webbläsare inom ramen för Google Analytics att slås samman med andra Google-data.
Du kan välja bort Google Analytics genom att följa länken nedan:</li>
</ul>
<p>Länk till avanmälan från Google Analytics</p>
<p>
<b>DoubleClick</b> är ett verktyg för att hantera digital reklam.
<b>Floodlight</b> fångar och rapporterar om konvertering, det vill säga webbplatsanvändares aktiviteter efter att de har fått se eller klickat på en annons, och ställer in målgrupper för att optimera marknadsföringsåtgärder och kampanjer.
Du kan välja bort det genom att ändra dina webbläsarinställningar enligt ovan.</p>
<p>·         Dessutom använder våra webbplatser <b>Google Tag Manager</b> från Google, som hjälper till att hantera webbplatstaggar via ett enda gränssnitt.
Verktyget (implementering av taggarna) utlöser andra taggar som också kan samla in (personliga) data.
Google Tag Manager har dock inte tillgång till dessa data.</p>
<p>
<i>•      </i>
<b>Session Cam</b> – våra webbplatser använder SessionCam för att skapa inspelningar av navigeringar från webbplatsbesök för att identifiera problem vid användning, som våra besökare kan uppleva.
Besöksinformationen samlas in av SessionCam och är anonym och inkluderar inte någon PII (personligt identifierbar information) Som en del av detta så spelar SessionCam in musrörelser, klick, mobilgester, form av inmatning samt skrollning.
För att ta reda på mer om hur Session Cam använder cookies, besök SessionCams integritetspolicy.
Som en individuell använder kan du välja så att all din aktivitet på webbplatsen är anonym och inte spelas in av SessionCam. Detta kan göras genom att klicka här: https://sessioncam.com/choose-not-to-be-recorded/.
Du kommer tas till en sida på SessionCams webbplats där du kan stänga av inspelningen av SessionCam via ett knapptryck.
Om du väljer att göra detta kommer en cookie att installeras i din webbläsare och denna kommer sedan användas av SessionCam för att indikera att besöken från enheten inte ska spelas in.
Datainsamling via denna service är till för att förbättra användarupplevelsen på vår webbplats.
Den insamlade informationen lagras och används för sammanlagd och statistisk rapportering och utvärderas för att förbättra funktionerna på våra webbplatser för våra besökare.<i>

Det är en remarketingtjänst med vilken vi kan rikta besökare till våra webbplatser via Facebook med annonsering som placerats av oss.
Visningen av personlig annonsering baseras på en analys av användningen av våra webbplatser med hjälp av cookies och jämförbar teknik, till exempel spårningspixlar, vilket gör det möjligt för oss att identifiera dem som så småningom konverterar till kunder från en Facebook.com kampanj.
Detta hjälper oss att mäta våra marknadsföringskampanjers genomslagskraft.
Tjänsten gör det också möjligt för oss att övervaka webbplatsaktivitet och ta fram underlag så att vi kan vidareutveckla kommunikationen till kunderna baserat på deras besök på  webbplatserna.
Vi får inte tillgång till personliga uppgifter i det här sammanhanget förrän du väljer att tillhandahålla dem genom att antingen fylla i ett formulär eller kontakta oss på ett annat sätt.</p>

<p>9.    <b>Çerezler ve benzeri teknolojiler.
internet analizi</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Çerez nedir? </b>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Çerezler, Sitelerimizden birini ziyaret ettiğinizde sabit diskinize veya tarayıcınızın belleğine indirilen küçük miktarda bilgi içeren metin dosyalarıdır.
Çerezler, sitelerimizin içeriğini ve yerleşimini düzenlememize ve sitelerimize daha önce gelen bilgisayarları ve diğer cihazları tanımamıza yardımcı oldukları için kullanışlıdır.
Çerezler, Sitelerimizin tercih ayarlarınızı hatırlamasına ve Sitelerimizin kullanılabilirliğini ve performansını ve bunları kullanma deneyiminizi geliştirmemize yardımcı olmak gibi pek çok şey yapar.</p>
<p>Sitelerimiz, ayrıca, belirli sayfaları ziyaret eden kullanıcıları saymamıza izin veren web işaretçileri, bazen de tek piksellik gif'ler, olarak bilinen elektronik görüntüler içerebilir.
Reklam amaçlı e-posta mesajlarının veya haber bültenlerinin açılıp açılmadığını veya bunlar üzerinde işlem yapılıp yapılmadığını belirlemek için bunlara web işaretçileri de ekleyebiliriz.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Kullandığımız çerez ve benzer teknoloji kategorileri</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sitelerimizde kullanılabilecek çerez veya benzer teknoloji türü 4 kategoriden 1 tanesine girebilir: Kesinlikle Gerekli, Performans, İşlevsellik &amp.
Profil ve Reklam.</p>
<p>
<b>1.    Kesinlikle Gerekli Tanımlama Bilgileri</b>
</p>
<p>Bu çerezler Sitenin temel işlevleri için ve Sitelerimizde gezinmenizi ve Sitelerimizin özellikle bilgi arama ve sipariş verme işlevlerini kullanmanızı sağladıklarından gereklidir.
Bu çerezler olmadan istediğiniz hizmetler verilemez.
Bu çerezler, hakkınızda pazarlama veya internette gezdiğiniz yerleri hatırlama gibi amaçlarla kullanılabilecek bilgiler toplamaz.
Kesinlikle gerekli çerezlerine örnek olarak, alışveriş sepetinize ürün eklediğinizde veya kasaya yöneldiğinizde satın almak istediğiniz ürünleri hatırlamak için kullanılan alışveriş sepeti çerezi, Sitedeki oturum açma işleminize izin veren ve bunu yöneten ve tek bir oturum için oturum açtıktan sonra sizi tanımlayan oturum açma / kimlik doğrulama çerezi, veri aktarımını yürütmek ve Siteyi size sunmak için gerekli olan bir oturum çerezi, tekrarlanan başarısız oturum açma denemelerini veya Sitelerdeki benzer suistimalleri tespit eden bir güvenlik çerezi verilebilir.
Bu tür çerezler sadece amaçları için gerekli olduğu sürece düzenli olarak saklanır.</p>
<p>
<b>2.    Performans Çerezleri</b>
</p>
<p>Bu çerezler, Sitelerimizi nasıl kullandığımız konusunda bilgi toplar.
örneğin, en sık hangi sayfalara girdiğiniz ve belirli sayfalardan hata mesajı alıp almadığınız.
Bu çerezler Sitemizin çalışma biçimini iyileştirmek için kullanılan bilgiler toplar.
Bu çerezler olmadan Sitelerimizin performansı hakkında bilgi sahibi olamaz ve gezinme deneyiminizi iyileştirecek ilgili geliştirmeleri yapamayız.
Sitemizin kullandığı performans çerezlerinin örnekleri arasında Google ve Adobe Analytics'ten gelen çerezler (ayrıntılı açıklama için aşağıya bakın) sayılabilir.</p>
<p>
<b>3.    İşlevsellik &amp.
Profil Çerezleri</b>
</p>
<p>Bu tanımlama bilgileri, Sitelerimizin, sağladığınız tercihler gibi bilgileri ve Sitelerimizle etkileşiminiz için kullanışlı olan teknik bilgileri saklamasına izin verir.
Örneğin, kullanıcı kimliğinizi ve kullanıcı profilinizin öğelerini hatırlarlar.
Ayrıca Siteleri kullanma deneyiminizin sizinle alakalı olmasını sağlarlar.
Bir video izlemek veya bir blogda yorum yapmak gibi istediğiniz hizmetleri sağlamak için de kullanılabilirler (Sitenin çalışması için kesinlikle gerekli olan bir çerez olmadan, kategori 1'e bakınız).
Bu çerezler başka web sitelerindeki gezinme etkinliğinizi izlemek için kullanılmaz.</p>
<p>Bu çerezler olmadan bir web sitesi daha önce yaptığınız tercihleri hatırlayamaz ve tarama deneyiminizi kişiselleştiremez.
Örneğin, ürün arama sonuçlarını size doğru dilde sunmamızı sağlayan dil tercihlerinizi saklamak için bir çerez kullanırız ve Sitelerimizde gösterdiğimiz çerez armasının görünümü hakkında yaptığınız tercihi saklamak için de yine bir çerez kullanırız.
Bu çerez, çerez armasının görünümüyle ilgili olarak yaptığınız tercihi, ileride armayla ilgili olarak bu tercihi yaptığınız siteyi ve aynı etki alanındaki veya aynı en üst düzey etki alanındaki diğer Şirket sitelerini ziyaret ettiğinizde hatırlamamıza yardımcı olur.</p>
<p>
<b>4.    Reklam Çerezleri ve Benzer Teknolojiler</b>
</p>
<p>Bu çerezler ve benzer teknolojiler, size ve ilgi alanlarınıza daha uygun reklamların sunulması için kullanılır.
Bunlar ayrıca bir reklamı gördüğünüz süreyi sınırlamak ve reklam kampanyasının etkililiğini ölçmeye yardımcı olmak için de kullanılabilir.
Bu çerezler başka web sitelerine yaptığınız ziyaretleri izleyebilir.
Bu çerezler veya benzer teknolojiler olmadan karşılaştığınız çevrimiçi reklamlar sizinle ve ilgi alanlarınızla daha az alakalı olacaktır.</p>
<p>Üçüncü taraf reklam ortaklarının (aşağıya bakınız), Sitelerimizi kullandığınızda, baktığınız veya satın aldığınız ürünler ve konumunuz dâhil olmak üzere zaman içerisindeki ve farklı web sitelerdeki gezinme etkinlikleriniz hakkında bilgi toplamak amacıyla çerezler ve benzer teknolojiler kullanmalarına izin veriyoruz.
Kullandığımız reklam çerezleri veya benzer teknoloji örnekleri, Google AdWords ve Facebook Pixels'i kapsamaktadır.</p>
<p>
<b>Çerez tercihinizi belirleme<br>
</b>
<br>
Çerezleri reddetmek için genellikle tarayıcı ayarlarınızı değiştirebilir ve çerezleri reddetmek veya devre dışı bırakmak için tarayıcınızın ayarlarını değiştirerek veya aşağıda paylaşılan kapsam dışı bırakma seçeneklerinden belirli çerezleri seçmeyerek onayınızı istediğiniz zaman geri çekebilirsiniz.
Tüm çerezleri reddetmeyi seçerseniz ziyaret ettiğiniz Sitelerin işlevlerini tam olarak kullanamayabilirsiniz.</p>
<p>
<b>Web analizini kullanımımız<br>
<br>
</b>Sitelerimize yapılan ziyaretleri izlemek için endüstri standardı web analizi kullanırız ("Web Analytics Sağlayıcıları").
Çerezler tarafından Sitelerimizi kullanma biçiminizle ilgili olarak üretilen bilgiler (IP adresiniz dâhil) Web Analiz Sağlayıcılarımız tarafından kendi sunucularına aktarılır ve bu sunucularda saklanır.
Web Analiz Sağlayıcıları, bu bilgileri Sitelerimizi kullanma biçiminizi değerlendirmek, web sitesi işletmenleri için web sitesi etkinlikleri hakkında raporlar derlemek ve web sitesi etkinliği ve internet kullanımıyla ilgili başka hizmetler sağlamak üzere kullanırlar (aşağıda belirtildiği gibi).
Web Analiz Sağlayıcıları, ayrıca, bu bilgileri yasaların gerekli kıldığı durumlarda veya bilgiyi üçüncü tarafların onlar adına işlediği durumlarda üçüncü taraflara aktarabilirler.</p>
<p>Pazarlama tedbirlerimizi ölçme, analiz etme ve optimize etme amacına hizmet eden ve sizin özel ilgi duyabileceğiniz kişiselleştirilmiş reklamlar sunan farklı analitik araçlar kullanıyoruz.
Özellikle, aşağıdaki araçları kullanıyoruz:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Advertising</b>, Twitter, Inc.'in ("Twitter") hizmeti.
Twitter, reklam teknolojisini entegre ederek bilgileri doğrudan Sitelerin kullanımından toplar.

<b>Google Analytics ve DoubleClick Floodlight</b>, ikisi de Google Inc.
("Google") hizmetidir: Google Analytics, Siteleri kullanımınızın analizini sağlayan çerezleri kullanır.
Toplanan bilgiler (IP adresi, tarama etkinlikleri ve Siteleri kullanımınızla bağlantılı diğer veriler, örneğin site ayrıntılarına, web tarayıcısına ve işletim sistemi türüne gönderme, dış bağlantılara tıklamalar, siteye özgü widget'larla etkileşim) genellikle ABD'deki Google sunucusuna aktarılır ve orada saklanır.
Fakat, portalda aktif hale getirdiğimiz IP anonimleştirmesi nedeniyle Google, daha önceden Avrupa Birliği/Avrupa Ekonomik Bölgesi Üye Ülkelerindeki IP adresinizi düşürecektir (Sitede AB/AEA’dayken geziniyorsanız).
Yalnızca istisnai durumlarda tam IP adresi ABD'deki bir Google sunucusuna iletilir ve orada kısaltılır.
Google’a göre, tarayıcınız tarafından Google Analytics çerçevesinde gönderilen IP adresi diğer Google verileriyle birleştirilmeyecektir.
