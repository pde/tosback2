For purposes of this Agreement, “affiliate” means any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Comcast Corporation.
Service(s) may include, but are not limited to, cable television service (“Video”), XFINITY High-Speed Internet service (“HSI”), and XFINITY Voice or Unlimited Select service (herein collectively “XV” WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS FOR UNLIMITED SELECT AS OTHERWISE INDICATED BELOW) (each a “Service” and collectively the “Services”).
The Service(s) do not include Comcast owned or controlled websites such as Comcast.com, Comcast.net, Fancast.com, or Plaxo.com.
Those websites have their own terms of service and policies that are accessible directly from those sites.</p>
<p>We may change our prices, fees, the Service(s) and/or the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the future.
Unless this Agreement or applicable law specifies otherwise, we will give you thirty (30) days prior notice of any significant change to this Agreement.
If you find the change unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Service(s).
However, if you continue to receive Service(s) after the end of the notice period (the “Effective Date”) of the change, you will be considered to have accepted the changes.
You may not modify this Agreement by making any typed, handwritten, or any other changes to it for any purpose.<br> Note: This Agreement contains a binding arbitration provision in Section 13 that affects your rights under this Agreement with respect to all Service(s).
These terms and conditions are subject to applicable tariffs and service guides.</p> GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <p>

<strong>2.
CHARGES AND BILLINGS</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>a.
Charges, Fees, and Taxes You Must Pay.</strong> You agree to pay all charges associated with the Service(s), including, but not limited to, installation/service call charges, monthly service charges, Xfinity Equipment (as defined below) charges, measured and per call charges, applicable federal, state, and local taxes and fees (however designated), regulatory recovery fees for municipal, state and federal government fees or assessments imposed on Comcast, permitted fees and cost recovery charges, or any programs in which Comcast participates, including, but not limited to, public, educational, and governmental access, universal service, telecom relay services for the visually/hearing impaired, rights-of-way access, and programs supporting the 911/E911 system and any fees or payment obligations imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies for the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Service(s).
<strong>YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED FEES AND TAXES THAT BECOME APPLICABLE RETROACTIVELY.</strong> We will provide you with notice and an effective date of any change in our prices or fees, unless the change in price is related to a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees, or assessments, in which case we may elect not to provide notice except where required by applicable law.
Not all fees apply to all Service(s).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Video Customers.</strong> Video price information is supplied with our Welcome Kit.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For HSI Customers.</strong> HSI price information is available at www.comcast.com (or an alternative site if we notify you).
</li>
<li>
<strong>For XV Customers.</strong> XV price information is available at www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service (or an alternative site if we notify you).
</li>
<li>
<strong>For Minimum Term Customers.</strong> If you have agreed to a minimum term arrangement, your price for Service(s) is as specified in the minimum term arrangement.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>b.
How We Will Bill You.
</strong>Unless you are subject to a minimum term arrangement, Service(s) are provided to you on a month-to-month basis.
You will generally be billed monthly, in advance, for recurring service charges, equipment charges, and fees.
<strong>YOU MUST PAY, ON OR BEFORE THE DAY WE INSTALL ANY OR ALL OF THE SERVICE(S), THE FIRST MONTH’S SERVICE CHARGES, XFINITY EQUIPMENT CHARGES, ANY DEPOSITS, AND ANY INSTALLATION CHARGES.
</strong>Your first bill may include pro-rated charges from the date you first begin receiving Service(s), as well as monthly recurring charges for the next month and charges for non-recurring services you have received.
You may be billed for some Service(s) individually after they have been provided to you.
these include measured and per-call charges (as explained below) and charges for pay-per-view movies or events, interactive television, and e-commerce.
If you receive Service(s) under a promotion, after the promotional period ends, regular charges for the Service(s) will apply.<br> We do not waive our rights to collect the full balance owed to us by accepting partial payment.
We will apply the partial payment to the outstanding charges in the amounts and proportions that we determine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For XV Customers.</strong> If you pay a flat monthly fee for your calling plan, that fee may not cover certain types of calls.
You will be billed for these excluded call types on a per-call basis (e.g., operator services) or a measured basis (e.g., international calls).<br> Generally, for billing purposes, a measured call begins when the call is answered by the called party or an automated answering device (such as an answering machine or fax machine).
it ends when one of the parties disconnects the call.
However, some providers (e.g., those involved in calls to foreign countries) charge for a completed call when the called party’s line rings or after a certain number of rings.
If such a provider charges Comcast, its affiliates, or suppliers as if your call were answered by the called party, Comcast will charge you for a completed call.<br> Measured calls are recorded in whole minutes, with partial minutes rounded up to the next whole minute.
If the charge for a measured call or for taxes or surcharges includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  See www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service for information on per-call charges and the timing of measured-call charges.<br> Our paper bills for XV contain only a summary of charges.
Detailed information about your calls and charges are available for a limited period at a password-protected portion of our website.
You may call 1-800-COMCAST for a paper copy of outbound toll call records related to your most recent bill.
There may be an additional charge for these outbound toll call records except as otherwise required by applicable law.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>c.
Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility.</strong> You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party service providers such as accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet or interactive options on your Video Service that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us.
You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes.
In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.</p>
<p>
<strong>d.
Alternative Billing Arrangements.
</strong>Comcast may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party.
Any such third-party charges shall be payable pursuant to any contract or other arrangement between you and the third party.
We will not be responsible for any dispute regarding these charges between you and any third party.
You must address all such disputes directly with the third party.</p>
<p>
<strong>e.
Payment by Credit Card or Check.
</strong>If you use a credit card to pay for the Service(s), use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
If Comcast does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand.
If you make payment by check, you authorize Comcast to collect your check electronically.
You agree that you may not amend or modify this Agreement with any restrictive endorsements (such as “paid in full”), or other statements or releases on or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by Comcast and any such notations shall have no legal effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>f.
Our Remedies if You Pay Late or Fail to Pay</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Late or Non-Payments:</strong> You may be billed fees, charges, and assessments related to late or non-payments if for any reason (a) Comcast does not receive payment for the Service(s) by the payment due date or (b) you pay less than the full amount due for the Service(s).
<strong>YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF 10% PER MONTH FOR ANY PAYMENT AMOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT.
No more than three (3) monthly late fees will be imposed for any single payment amount that is past due, regardless of the period during which the payment remains past due.
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Garrett and Allegany County, Maryland Customers.</strong>You may be billed fees, charges and assessments related to late payments or non-payments if for any reason (a) Comcast does not receive from you any required payment for the Service(s) by the payment due date or (b) you pay less than the full amount due for the Service(s).
YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF $4.95 PER MONTH FOR EACH ACCOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT.

</li>
<li>
<strong>For Hancock, Maryland Customers.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties:</strong> Comcast does not anticipate that you will fail to pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers.
Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments.
These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance: (a) whether you will pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, if ever.
(b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay.
and (c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Collection Costs:</strong> If we use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection.
These costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency’s fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and arbitration or court costs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Suspension/Disconnect: </strong>If you fail to pay the full amount due for any or all of the Service(s) then Comcast, at its sole discretion in accordance with and subject to applicable law, may suspend or disconnect any or all the Service(s) you receive.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>g.
Reconnection Fees and Related Charges.
</strong>If you resume Service(s) after any suspension, we may require you to pay a reconnection fee.
If you reinstate any or all Service(s) after disconnection, we may require you to pay an installation fee and/or service activation fee.
These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees.
Reconnection of the Service(s) is subject to our credit policies, this Agreement and applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>h.
Our Right to Make Credit Inquiries.
YOU AUTHORIZE COMCAST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING YOU TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>i.
Your Responsibilities Concerning Billing Questions.</strong> Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a billing credit, you must contact Comcast within sixty (60) days of the date on the bill.
You waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within sixty (60) days.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Sacramento, California Customers.</strong>If there are any billing errors or other requests for credit, you must bring those to our attention within sixty (60) days of the time you receive the bill for which you are seeking correction, unless applicable law provides for a longer period which cannot be waived or otherwise modified.
We will investigate and respond to all complaints within five (5) business days of the receipt of the complaint.
In some cases, an investigation might require a search of historical records that could take up to 14 business days.
If you believe a payment was made which was not credited to your account, a copy of a cancelled check or money order may be required and the disputed amount will be set aside for up to fourteen (14) days while you gather that documentation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.
REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT</strong>
<br> We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Service(s), if you add Xfinity Equipment and/or Service(s) or if you fail to pay any amounts when they are due.
If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service(s) or for any Xfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For Prince Georges, Maryland Customers.</strong>If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within thirty (30) days or your next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service(s) or for any ComcastXfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4.
CHANGES TO SERVICES</strong>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Non-Recommended Configurations:</strong> Customer Equipment that does not meet Comcast’s minimum technical or other specifications constitutes a “Non-Recommended Configuration.” NEITHER COMCAST NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS WARRANT THAT A NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY INSTALL, ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE(S).
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY SUCH INSTALLATION, ACCESS, OPERATION, OR USE COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT TO FAIL TO OPERATE OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT, YOU, YOUR PREMISES OR XFINITY EQUIPMENT.
NEITHER COMCAST NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY SUCH FAILURE OR DAMAGE.
Comcast reserves the right to deny you customer support for the Service(s) and/or terminate Service(s) if you use a Non-Recommended Configuration.
</li>
<li>
<strong>No Unauthorized Devices or Tampering: </strong>You agree not to attach or assist any person to attach, any unauthorized device to our cable network, Xfinity Equipment or the Service(s).

</ul>
<p>
<strong>c.
Inside Wiring.</strong> You may install Inside Wiring, such as additional cable wiring and outlets, provided it does not interfere with the normal operations of our cable network.
If you have us install Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service.
Regardless of who installed it, we consider the Inside Wiring your property or the property of whomever owns the Premises.
Accordingly, you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the Inside Wiring, unless you and Comcast have agreed otherwise in writing.
(If you do not own the Premises, contact your landlord or building manager about the repair or maintenance of Inside Wiring.) If you have us repair or maintain the Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service.</p>
<ul>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<strong>For XV Customers.</strong> Except as described below, you may use XV with your telephone Inside Wiring, as long as we have reasonable access to it and you have the right to give us access to it.
If you wish to have your voice capable modem connected to your telephone Inside Wiring, you are advised to have a Comcast technician perform the installation.
To make that connection, we must first disconnect your telephone Inside Wiring from the network of your existing telephone provider, which may disable any services you receive from them.
If you install XV yourself (where self-installation is an option), you should connect the voice capable modem to a cordless phone, not directly to your telephone Inside Wiring.
If the voice capable modem is connected to your telephone Inside Wiring without first disconnecting the wiring from any existing telephone provider’s network, the voice capable modem may be damaged and/or XV may not operate properly.
</li>

BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>a.
Purpose.</strong> If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with Comcast that cannot be resolved through an informal dispute resolution with Comcast, you or Comcast may elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court.
Arbitration means you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>
<strong>b.
Definitions.</strong> The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Comcast regarding any aspect of your relationship with Comcast, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision.
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.
As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Comcast” means Comcast and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.</p>
<p>
<strong>c.
Right to Opt Out.</strong> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST RECEIVE THIS AGREEMENT BY VISITING WWW.COMCAST.COM/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT, OR BY MAIL TO COMCAST 1701 JOHN F.
KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.
YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND COMCAST ACCOUNT NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION.

<p>
<strong>d.

<p>
<strong>e.
Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Because the Service(s) provided to you by Comcast concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, applicable federal law or the law of the state where you receive the service from Comcast may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes.
No state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall be applicable under this Arbitration Provision.<br> If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the arbitration organization, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.
If AAA will not enforce this Arbitration Provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute with Comcast.
If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization.
If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this Arbitration Provision as written.
If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.<br> A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute.
The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information.<br> The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.<br> If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.
The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization.
The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed.
The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.</p>

<strong>1.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>a.
Limitations.</strong> XV includes 911/Enhanced 911 functionality (“911/E911”) that may differ from the 911/E911 functionality furnished by other providers.

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>i.
Correct Address:</strong> In order for your 911/E911 calls to be properly directed to emergency services, Comcast must have your correct Premises address.
If you move XV to a different address without Comcast’s approval, 911/E911 calls may be directed to the wrong emergency authority, may transmit the wrong address, and/or XV (including 911/E911) may fail altogether.
Therefore, you must call 1-800-COMCAST before you move XV to a new address.
Comcast will need several business days to update your Premises address in the E911 system so that your 911/E911 calls can be properly directed.
All changes in service address require Comcast’s prior approval.</p>
<p>
<strong>ii.
Service Interruptions: </strong>XV uses the electrical power in your home.
If there is an electrical power outage, 911 calling may be interrupted if a battery backup in the associated voice capable modem is not installed, fails, or is exhausted after several hours.
Furthermore, calls, including calls to 911/E911, may not be completed if there is a problem with network facilities, including network congestion, network/equipment/power failure, or another technical problem.</p>
<p>
<strong>iii.
Suspension and Termination by Comcast: </strong>You understand and acknowledge that all XV, including 911/E911, as well as all online features of XV, where we make these features available, will be disabled if your account is suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>
<strong>iv.
Telephone Number Assignments:</strong>  The telephone numbers utilized for XV are assigned in accordance with applicable federal and state numbering rules. Therefore, XV cannot accommodate the assignment of a telephone number outside of the telephone rate center to which that number is appropriately assigned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>b.
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.</strong> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMCAST WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SERVICE OUTAGE, INABILITY TO DIAL 911 USING THE SERVICE(S), AND/OR INABILITY TO ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL.

Non-Recommended Configurations as defined in Section 6(b) [including, but not limited to, voice capable modems not currently certified by Comcast as compatible with the Service(s)];</p>
<p>ii.

<p>vi.
Other call types not expressly set forth in our product literature (e.g., outbound shore-to-ship calling).
and</p>
<p>vii.
Certain service codes such as automatic callback and automatic recall (e.g., *66, *69) due to compatibility limitations with other carrier signal functions.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>3. VOICE-CAPABLE MODEM BACKUP BATTERY<br>
</strong>If the voice-capable modem is equipped with a backup battery, such battery is used to provide service during a power outage to your home where power to Comcast’s network remains available.
The length of time that XV will be available during a power outage will depend on the following: (i) the backup battery remains properly installed in the voice capable modem.
(ii) the condition and age of the backup battery.
and (iii) the amount of XV usage when the voice capable modem is utilizing power from the backup battery.
You understand and acknowledge that: (i) the performance of the backup battery is not guaranteed.
and (ii) you will not be able to use XV if electrical power to the voice capable modem is interrupted and the voice capable modem does not have a functioning backup battery.
If you are leasing a voice capable modem from Comcast, call 1-800-COMCAST if you believe the backup battery is not working properly or a replacement backup battery is needed.
The voice capable modem backup battery does not power cordless phones or other equipment connected to the telephone line that require electricity from your Premises, such as telecommunications devices used to assist customers with disabilities.</p>
