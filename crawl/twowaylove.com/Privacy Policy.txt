We care about your privacy
<br>
<br> Your privacy is very important to us.
Apart from the information you give to interact with other menbers on the twowaylove.com website (see Terms of Use, TwoWayLove.com (TWL) collects information only for performing statistical analysis and preventing abuse of our service.
Any information that is no longer needed for these purposes is deleted.<br>
<br>What information do we collect?
<br>
<br> We collect cookies to authenticate your browser to TWL.
Cookies don't store any personally identifying information, such as your name or email address.
You can also disable the cookies using your web-browser preferences, if you prefer.
Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to use certain parts of the TWL services or certain functions and features of the TWL site.<br>
<br> If you choose to register with TWL, we require some personal information.
We ask for your name, a nickname, an email address, a username, and a password (which you can choose yourself).
This information is stored in a secure database, and your password is processed such that it cannot be recovered.
If you participate in a discussion forum or leave feedback, we'll show your nickname next to your comments and feedback.<br>
<br>Why do we collect information?
<br>
<br> The information we collect when you create an account with TWL is used to identify you as a unique user.
Without this information we would not be able to provide a service to the user community.
The information the TWL portal collects is used for your convenience and for statistical purposes.
For example, if you forget your password, we can help you create a new one and guide you through this via email.
Background information such as age or gender is used to provide statistical information about website preferences.
This statistical information is stored without any personal information.<br>

features within the site.<br>
<br> TWL uses Piwik Analytics, a web analytics solution.
Piwik adds cookies to your computer when you visit the Portal and collects information about website traffic to create statistics for the site owner.
Unlike other analytical products, Piwik is hosted on the same server as the website and is, therefore, a little faster in operation and controlled by TWL.
Additionally, unlike most analytical products, Piwik does not make any data available to third-party companies which might reuse this data for other purposes.<br>
<br> TWL may also embed badges from the social networking site Twitter and Facebook.
The badges may add cookies to your computer when you visit the Portal.
 See Twitter privacy policy and Facebook privacy policy, for details.<br>
