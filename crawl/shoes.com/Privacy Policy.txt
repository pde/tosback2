Information Collection and Use <br> Information is collected from users at several different points on this website, including registration and order forms.
We may use this information in the following ways:<br>
<br> When you provide your information to one of Shoes.com, Inc.
websites, we may share that information with one or more of our other websites.<br>
<br> In order to streamline your shopping experience, we recommend that you complete our registration form.
During registration you are required to give personal contact information (such as name and email address).
By registering your account information, you are able to take advantage of special offers and e-mails about new promotions, fashion trends, site and service announcement updates, etc.
It is also more convenient for a registered customer to make purchases online.
We do not share your registration information with outside parties.<br>
<br> On the order form, you must provide contact information (such as name, billing address and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you.<br>
<br> If you elect to refer a friend to our website, we ask you for your name and email address and your friend's name and email address.
We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him or her to view your selected items on the website.
We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this email.<br>
<br> The personal information you provide may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from Shoes.com, Inc.
records and other sources.
This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient.<br>
<br> From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level).
Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
We may share this information with our service providers who perform services such as gathering survey data or facilitating contests on our behalf, but we do not authorize these providers to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.
<br>
<br> Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive information on products, services and special promotions.

</p>
Choice and Opt-out
<br> Our users are given the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.
For example, our Customer Account information form has an opt-out mechanism so users who register with us but don’t want any marketing material can keep their email address off our lists.
If you no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe option at the bottom of any email communication you receive or by clicking here.

Cookies
<br> A cookie is a short string of data that lets our website remember who you are, serving much like a unique membership ID.
We use cookies to remember reference keys to some of your search preferences, express checkout capabilities and other site preferences so we can provide a more convenient experience during your next site visit.<br>
<br> We don't store any personal information in the cookie--it's really just a combination of numbers and letters that uniquely identify your computer.
We absolutely don't store any credit card or financial data in the cookie.
All real account information and transaction histories are kept in our secure database.
When you leave our site, we terminate our interaction with the cookie.
The cookie stays on your computer, and you can delete it anytime you'd like, but that means that you'd need to login again and re-enter any preferences you have set.

<br>Shipping, Billing and Other Service Companies
<br> We use outside shipping companies to ship orders and mail catalogs and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.

Do Not Track Policy Some web browsers have a âdo not trackâ feature that lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
These features are not yet uniform across browsers, so this site is not currently set up to respond to those signals.
<p>
</p>
Notification of Changes Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
Additionally, if at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email.
At that time, you will have a choice as to whether we use your information in this different manner.
