<p>The Cable Internet Service speed may vary depending on location, line quality, inside wiring, Internet traffic, the cable provider in your area ("Cable Provider") and other factors beyond the control of EarthLink.
When using the Cable Internet Service, you are solely responsible for determining if use of a particular dial-up number will cause you to incur long-distance, toll, or any other charges, including simultaneous login charges.
EarthLink does not guarantee that any dial-up access numbers EarthLink provides to you will be a local call from your location.
EarthLink is not responsible for any long-distance, toll, or other charges you incur.
Toll-free (800, 888, 877), international, and simultaneous login access costs will be extra.
Current prices and features are listed on the EarthLink Website located at www.earthlink.net .

</p>
<p>If your inbox is approaching its storage limit, it also will be noted visually on your web mail and EarthLink also will send you email notices to your EarthLink email address notifying you that you are approaching your email storage limit.
Email accounts exceeding allotted email space may, depending on the billing plan and at EarthLink's discretion, be suspended and be transferred to a compressed temporary file or storage or may be deleted.
</p>
<p>The Cable Internet Service billing plan permits up to 20 hours per month of dial-up connection to the Internet from only one computer at a time.
If two or more computers are logged into one EarthLink account to access the Internet at the same time ("Simultaneous Usage"), Simultaneous Usage charges will be accrued for that month.
The Simultaneous Usage fee is $1.00 per hour, pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle.
The Simultaneous Usage fee will be added to your monthly bill.
Although some EarthLink access plans come with multiple email addresses, the use of two or more dial-up connections from one EarthLink account at the same time to access multiple email addresses associated with that account will accrue Simultaneous Usage charges.
</p>
<p>The Cable Provider may limit the amount of data that you can upload and/or download each month through the Cable Internet Service.
If Comcast is your Cable Provider for your Cable Internet Service, then your monthly data usage cannot exceed 250 gigabytes.
Data usage, also known as bandwidth usage, is the total amount of data, photos, videos and other files that you send, receive, download and upload over a specific period of time.
Comcast will call those customers who exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly consumption limit to inform them of how much data per month the account has used, help them identify the source of such excessive data usage, suggest ways to reduce data usage and explain the consequences of continuing to exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly usage cap, including termination of the Cable Internet Service.
If within six (6) months of the first call from Comcast about such excessive use, a customer continues to exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly consumption limit, then such customer's Cable Internet Service may be terminated.
Customers whose Cable Internet Service is terminated as a result of exceeding the 250 gigabyte monthly usage cap will be prohibited from subscribing to the Cable Internet Service for a year following the applicable termination date.
For more information on this 250 gigabytes monthly data usage cap, go to Frequently Asked Questions - Usage Cap, EarthLink Internet Cable Service powered by Comcast .
