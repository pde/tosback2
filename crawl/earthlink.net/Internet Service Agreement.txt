MISCELLANEOUS </strong>
</p>
<p>You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void.
If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby.
The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 18.
if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court.
EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision.
Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties.
EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent.
EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.
