<p>You represent that when you transmit, upload, post or submit any content, images or data using the Service you have the legal right to do so and that your use of such data or content does not violate any law (including copyright or trademark laws) or any other third party rights.
You agree that EarthLink has no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, value or usefulness of any content, advice or opinions contained in any emails, third party web sites, message boards, chat rooms, social networks or online services.

If your mailbox is approaching the storage limit for your Service, it will be noted visually on your web mail.
EarthLink also will send email notices to this mailbox stating you are approaching your email storage limit.
When your mailbox exceeds the allotted email storage space, you will receive a second email warning from EarthLink that your email storage is over quota and then EarthLink will stop transmitting email messages to your inbox.
Any incoming emails will be bounced with an error message to the sender stating that your mailbox is full.

You may purchase additional storage up to a fixed limit as described at https://.myaccount.earthlink.net or https://myacount.peoplepc.com.</p>
<p>Certain billing plans may offer the ability to create your personal webspace.

<p>EarthLink Dial-Up and PeoplePC Dial-Up accounts permit a dial-up connection to the Internet from only one computer at a time without incurring additional fees.
however, if two or more computers are logged into an EarthLink Dial-Up account or a PeoplePC Dial-Up account to access the Internet at the same time ("Simultaneous Usage"), Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue for that month.
The Simultaneous Usage fee is $1.00 per hour, pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle.
The Simultaneous Usage fee will be added to your monthly bill.
Although some EarthLink Dial-Up and PeoplePC Dial-Up plans come with multiple email addresses, Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue if two or more dial-up connections from one Dial-Up account are accessing more than one of these email addresses at the same time.
</p>
<p>EarthLink Residential DSL and PeoplePC DSL customers also may accrue Simultaneous Usage fees if accessing the Internet through a dial-up modem.
DSL Service accounts allow up to 20 hours per month of dial-up modem access to the Internet.
If you access the Internet via two or more dial-up modem connections at the same time using the same DSL Service account, Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue for that month.
If you have a DSL account, your primary connection via the DSL Service does not count toward the Simultaneous Usage calculations.</p>
<p>7.
LOCAL TELEPHONE, TOLL AND LONG DISTANCE CHARGE</p>
<p>When using the Service, you are solely responsible for determining if use of a particular dial-up number, if applicable, will cause you to incur long-distance, toll, or any other charges, including Simultaneous Usage charges.
EarthLink does not guarantee that any dial-up access numbers EarthLink provides will be a local call from your location.
EarthLink is not responsible for any long-distance, toll, or other charges you incur.
Toll-free (800, 888, 877), international, and Simultaneous Usage access costs will be extra.</p>
<p>EarthLink may change its POP numbers at any time.
EarthLink reserves the right to direct you to use certain numbers to access the Service or to restrict use of specific access numbers.
</p>
<p>8.
BILLING AND PAYMENT</p>
<p>You agree to pay the monthly fees in your billing plan for the Service and to pay (i) applicable taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity and (ii) other applicable fees and charges.
Depending on the billing plan for your Service, the other fees and charges may include hardware fees, activation fees, early termination fees, method of payment fees, or shipping and handling fees.
If your billing plan is based on a monthly subscription fee in addition to any of the aforementioned charges, you will be billed a flat monthly fee.
If your billing plan is based on usage, you will be billed each month based on usage.
EarthLink reserves the right to change the monthly fees of your billing plan upon 30 days prior notice to your EarthLink or PeoplePC contact email address on file prior to the effective date of such new monthly fee.

You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options.

</p>
<p>If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly invoice.
When you pay your fees by check, you authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment.
If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day as EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement.
EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.</p>
<p>If you signed up for a pre-paid billing plan, you will receive the Service for the duration of your membership term without further monthly Service fees.
Depending on which pre-paid billing plan you signed up under, your membership may convert to either a monthly or a fixed period membership at the end of the fixed pre-paid membership term.
Pricing will be subject to the rates in effect at that time for that Service.
If you cancel your membership before the end of the fixed term or if EarthLink terminates your membership for violations of this Agreement or other applicable EarthLink agreements or policies, and you have paid EarthLink in advance, the amount you have paid for your membership will not be refunded in whole or in part.</p>

<p>19.
ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR THE DSL SERVICE AND THE EARTHLINK DSL MODEM</p>
<p>This Section 19 explains the additional terms and conditions specific to the DSL Service and the EarthLink DSL Modem.
EarthLink charges a shipping and handling fee for shipping the DSL self-installation kit to you.
The free DSL self-installation kit includes the software needed to begin using the DSL Service and the EarthLink DSL Modem and filters.
After your payment of the shipping and handling fee clears, EarthLink will begin the provisioning process which includes shipping the DSL self-installation kit to you.
EarthLink recommends use of such EarthLink DSL Modem in order to ensure proper ongoing support for the DSL Service.
however, if you decide to use another provider's modem, the provisioning process will begin immediately after sign-up.</p>
<p>The installation, use, inspection, maintenance, repair, and removal of the EarthLink DSL Modem may result in a Service outage or potential damage to your computer.
You are solely responsible for backing up all of your existing computer files and data.
The EarthLink Parties will have no liability whatsoever for any damage to or loss or destruction of any of your hardware, software, files, data, or peripherals.
You assume responsibility for impacts to or loss of any warranty associated with the opening of your computer for installation purposes.</p>
<p>If you are unable to perform the self-installation of the EarthLink DSL Modem, EarthLink may suggest an outside vendor to help install the EarthLink DSL Modem.
You will be responsible for all costs and scheduling associated with the installation of the EarthLink DSL Modem by a third party.
You are also responsible for all inside wiring repair necessary to install the EarthLink DSL Modem.
If you are not the owner of the premises, you warrant that you have obtained the consent of the owner for vendor personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for installation.
You will indemnify, defend and hold the EarthLink Parties harmless from and against any claims of the owner of the premises arising out of the performance of this Agreement.</p>
<p>EARTHLINK DOES NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT, OR COVENANT THAT INSTALLATION BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY CHOSEN BY YOU WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE, NOR THAT SUCH INSTALLATION WILL NOT CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER, DATA, SOFTWARE, FILES, OR PERIPHERALS.</p>
<p>THE EARTHLINK PARTIES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE, OR FOR THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY INSTALL, ACCESS, USE, OR OPERATE THE EARTHLINK DSL MODEM OR THE DSL SERVICE BECAUSE OF YOUR INSTALLATION.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS IN ADDITION TO AND WILL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>Because of the complex nature of Internet service, availability, and the underlying infrastructure, it may not be possible to provide the DSL Service to everyone.
In its sole discretion, EarthLink may cancel the installation process and refund any money that you have paid.
EarthLink will notify you of its intent to cancel as soon as reasonably possible.
It may take up to 90 days to determine if EarthLink is able to provide the DSL Service.
The EarthLink Parties will have no responsibility whatsoever for claims arising out of EarthLink's failure or refusal to complete the installation or provide the DSL Service.</p>
<p>Changes to your DSL Service billing plan in months two through twelve may result in an early termination fee.
Such changes may include (i) cancellation of your DSL Service, (ii) downgrading or changing your DSL Service to another EarthLink or PeoplePC Service, or (iii) if you move the DSL Service to a new location, change your local telephone company within the same location or discontinue your local telephone service within the same location.</p>
<p>If you move your DSL Service or change your local telephone company and EarthLink can provide the DSL Service at the new location or on the new telephone line, you must pay a reactivation fee because this change requires a new installation.
however, EarthLink will credit a portion of any early termination fee to your account providing you reactivate the DSL Service and begin a new billing plan within 60 days from the date you terminated the previous DSL Service.
If EarthLink cannot provide the DSL Service in your new location on your new telephone line, you will be charged the early termination fee.</p>
<p>If you cancel your DSL Service account within the first 35 days from the shipment date of your EarthLink DSL Modem, you must return your EarthLink DSL Modem.
