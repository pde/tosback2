GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE SERVICE </strong>
</p>
<p> The Service speed may vary depending on location, line quality, inside wiring, Internet traffic, and other factors beyond the control of EarthLink.
EarthLink does not guarantee upload or download speeds.
Some line stabilization may be necessary for the Service.
Stabilization could include the lowering of provisioned line speed.
Should this occur, EarthLink will NOT be able to increase the line speed once the connection is stabilized.
Some of the Services may only work using certain telephone carriers or non-PBX (including rollover/party line) phone systems.
Some of the Services may require the use of specific hardware and/or software and may be limited by specific geographic location.
</p>
<p> The Service may require separate active telephone or cable service in order for the Service to work.
You are responsible for charges for such telephone or cable service.
Please note that changing telephone carriers or cable providers may result in substantial interruption of the Service and may result in fees associated with cancellation and setting up a new account.
</p>
<p> EarthLink also reserves the right to change any of the features, content or applications of the Service at any time with or without notice to you.
</p>
<p> Because of the complex nature of Internet service, availability, and the underlying infrastructure, it may not be possible to provide the Service to everyone.
In its sole discretion, EarthLink may cancel the Service and refund any money that you have paid.
EarthLink will notify you of its intent to cancel as soon as reasonably possible.

<p> Depending on the billing plan for your EarthLink Dial-Up Service or PeoplePC Dial-Up Service (collectively, "Dial-Up Service") you may have a limit to the number of hours of connection to the Internet per monthly billing cycle.
</p>
<p> The Dial-Up Service allows a dial-up connection to the Internet from only one computer at a time without incurring additional fees.
however, if two or more Devices are logged into a Dial-Up account to access the Internet at the same time ("Simultaneous Usage"), Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue for that month.
The Simultaneous Usage fee is $1.00 per hour, pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle.
The Simultaneous Usage fee will be added to your monthly bill.
Although some EarthLink access plans come with multiple email addresses, Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue if two or more dial-up connections from one account for the Dial-Up Service are accessing more than one of these email addresses at the same time.
</p>
<p> Unless your Service includes a static IP address, you will be allocated a dynamic IP address.
For the Dial-Up Service, EarthLink reserves the right to timeout connections that EarthLink deems are excessive.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS) </strong>
</p>
<p> 18.1 Summary </p>
<p> Most subscriber concerns can be resolved by calling 1-800-EARTHLINK.
If EarthLink is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if EarthLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, EarthLink will pay all costs of the arbitration.
Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from EarthLink to at least the same extent as you would be in court.
</p>
<p> In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), EarthLink will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what EarthLink has offered you to settle the dispute.
</p>
<p> 18.2 Agreement to Arbitrate </p>
<p> EarthLink and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li> Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
</li>
<li> Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising).
</li>
<li> Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and </li>
<li> Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
</li>
</ul>
<p> References to "EarthLink," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service under this Agreement or prior agreements between us.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court rather than by arbitration if the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over EarthLink and you is proper.
This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
</p>
<p> You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and EarthLink are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
</p>
<p> 18.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration </p>
<p> 18.3(1) Notice of Dispute </p>
<p> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
A Notice to EarthLink should be addressed to: EarthLink, LLC, 4001 Rodney Parham Rd., Little Rock, AR 72212, Mailstop B1F03-53A, Attn: Legal Department (Arbitration) ("Notice Address").
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
A Notice to you will be addressed to the billing address that EarthLink has on file for you.
</p>
<p> 18.3(2) Settlement Proposals </p>
<p> The amount of any settlement offer made by EarthLink or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator in any arbitration between us until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or EarthLink is entitled.
</p>
<p> 18.3(3) Failure to Reach Resolution </p>
<p> If EarthLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or EarthLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.
</p>
<p> 18.4 Commencement of Arbitration </p>
<p> You may initiate an arbitration by filing a claim form with the AAA and sending a copy of the claim form to EarthLink at the Notice Address.
You can access a claim form and directions for filing at the website for AAA, https://www.adr.org.
If EarthLink receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration and paid the filing fee to the AAA, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee by check to your address or by credit to your account unless your claim is for greater than $75,000.
(The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.
If you are unable to pay this fee, EarthLink will pay it directly upon receiving a written request from you to the Notice Address.) </p>
<p> 18.5 Arbitration Procedures </p>
<p> The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules, will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
Unless EarthLink and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
The right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
</p>
<p> 18.6 Appeal </p>
<p> If an award issued by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.
The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA.
The AAA will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed.
The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel will be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.
If an award issued by the arbitrator does not exceed $75,000, any appeal rights from the award will be governed by the FAA.
</p>
<p> 18.7 Arbitration Fees </p>
<p> Except as otherwise provided for herein, EarthLink will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse EarthLink for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
</p>
<p> 18.8 Awards and Attorney's Fees </p>
<p> If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of EarthLink's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, or if the arbitrator issues you an award and EarthLink made no settlement offer, then EarthLink will pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 ("Alternative Payment"), whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees incurred, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney, if any, reasonably accrues and documents with specificity for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("Attorney Fee Award").
</p>
<p> The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Award at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
</p>
<p> The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in this Section 18.8 supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.
Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.
However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or expenses.
Although under some laws EarthLink may have the right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, EarthLink agrees that it will not seek such an award.
</p>
<p> 18.9 Waiver of Class Actions.
Limits of Scope of Arbitrator's Authority </p>
<p> The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
YOU AND EARTHLINK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and EarthLink agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void and all disputes will be heard by a court.
</p>
<p> 18.10 Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate </p>
<p> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if EarthLink makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your subscription with EarthLink, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to the Notice Address postmarked within 30 days of the date of the change.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language in this Section 18 of this Version dated September 15, 2016.

MISCELLANEOUS </strong>
</p>
<p> You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void.
If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired thereby.
The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration provision in Section 18.
if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the entire DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision (but only the DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION provision) will be null and void and the dispute will be heard by a court.
EarthLink may amend or replace such unenforceable provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision.
Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties.
EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent.
EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.
