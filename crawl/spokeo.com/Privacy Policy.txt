</ul> Privacy<p> Spokeo aggregates publicly available information from phone books, social networks, marketing surveys, real estate listings, and other public sources.
This third-party data is then indexed through methods similar to those used by Google or Bing to create a listing.
Because Spokeo only collects this data and does not create it, we cannot fully guarantee its accuracy.
