You acknowledge that (a) Canary cannot provide the Products properly if requirements and compatibility are not met, and (b) you will not receive notifications from your Equipment when the Product’s internet connection or power is lost, not operating properly, cut, or interfered with, or the Product is damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>You must have a working broadband internet connection and either a wired ethernet connection (for certain Products) or a Wi-Fi router (802.11 b/g/n), a supported mobile device (to use the Mobile Application), and other hardware, software, equipment or items specified by Canary from time to time.
We recommend a high-speed internet connection with at least 1 Mbps of upload bandwidth.
Canary reserves the right to change any of the minimum system requirements at any time.</p>7.
Registration and User Accounts<p>To create an account you must submit your information through the registration page as prompted on the Mobile Application or our Sites, including your name, email address, phone number, zip code/post code, and address.
You may provide additional optional information during setup which is not required to register for an account but may be necessary to provide you with full access to our Products, to provide you with a trial of premium or Membership services, or might be helpful to Canary in providing you with a more customized experience.
This information could include, for example, payment information, which would be processed in accordance with Canary’s Sales Terms and Premium Services.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process, you will create a password that will allow you to log in to the Products.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for all activities that occur on your account.
You agree not to share your password, let others access or use your password, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your password.</p>
<p>All the information that you provide when registering for an account and otherwise through the Site must be accurate, complete, and up to date.
You may change, correct, or remove any information from your account by either logging into your account directly and making the desired changes or contacting Canary’s support team.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location Owners &amp.
Location Members</strong>
</p>
<p>The individual who first creates an account and sets up the Product is the owner of the Canary Product associated with that account and the primary account holder (“Location Owner”).
Individuals who are authorized to access a Location Owner’s Products and Services are authorized users (“Location Members”) under the Location Owner’s account and are invited through the Mobile Application.
Location Members may have the ability to use the Products and monitor and control the Products (for example, a Location Member can arm or disarm the Product or sound the Siren).
Location Members may also have the ability to view information (including personal information) and content across all of Location Owner’s Products (for example, a Location Member will receive notifications of events or can view video).
Location Members are responsible for their own actions in connection with the Products and Services, but the Location Owner also agrees to be fully responsible for all actions taken by a Location Member relating to the Products and Products.</p>
<p>Once invited by a Location Owner, Location Members can also invite other individuals to join the account as new location members.
If you are a Location Owner, you should therefore authorize only those individuals that you trust to access your account and the Services.</p>
<p>Location Owners have special privileges associated with their account and are the only individuals that can authorize specific actions or settings.
For example, Location Owners are solely authorized to request location level data be deleted, to transfer ownership of the Product, or to subscribe to paid features, such as Canary’s subscription plans.
<strong>Please note that for security reasons, Canary will not determine or change ownership of Equipment for any reason without the express written consent of the individual designated as the “Location Owner” at Equipment setup</strong>.</p>
<p>If you transfer your Equipment to a new owner, your right to use the Products with respect to that Equipment will automatically terminate.
The new owner cannot use the Products under your account and will need to register for a separate account with Canary.</p>8.
Security of Your Information<p>Canary cares about the integrity and security of its users’ personal information.
Canary uses industry best practices when it comes to security.
Canary has also conducted third-party security audits with respect to the Services.
Despite taking these steps, Canary cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat Canary’s security measures.
You acknowledge that you provide your personal information and your use of the Services is at your own risk.</p>9.
Integration With Third-Party Platforms and Services<p>Canary may allow you to integrate Canary Products with one or more third-party products or services.
For example, Canary currently integrates with the Wink Smart home platform, which allows you to change modes on your Equipment directly from the Wink mobile application.
You decide whether and with which Third-Party Products or Services you want to interface.
Your explicit consent and authorization is required for this interface, and is revocable by you at any time.
Once your consent is given for a particular Third-Party Product and Service, you agree that Canary may exchange information and data regarding you and your Products, including your account information in order to enable the interface you have authorized to work together with Canary Products.
Once this information is shared with the particular Third-Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the third party's privacy policy and terms of service.</p>10.
Electronic Communications<p>By using the Services, you consent to receiving service related electronic communications from Canary, which may include notices about applicable fees, transactional information, and other information related to the Services.
You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send you electronically will satisfy any legal requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>11.
Termination and Suspension of Services<p>These Terms continue in effect while you access and use the Services.
At any time, Canary may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services (which include, for avoidance of doubt, any Premium Services), or (ii) terminate these Terms if Canary in good faith believes that you have used the Services in violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines or terms.
Upon termination of this Agreement, your right to use the Services will automatically terminate.
The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability, governing law &amp.
jurisdiction and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>Canary may temporarily suspend the Services without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances.
Canary does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.</p>
<p>Any termination or suspension of any Services (including Premium Services) will not result in any credit or refund of any kind.</p>12.
Mobile Applications<p>Canary does not warrant that the Mobile Application will be compatible with your mobile device.
Other applications may interact with the Mobile Application in unpredictable ways, and Canary does not warrant against malfunctions or errors caused by such interactions.</p>
<p>Canary grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use any object code copy of the Mobile Application for one registered account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you for your personal use in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>Canary and its third-party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Mobile Application.
Standard carrier data charges may apply to your use of the Mobile Application.</p>
<p>The following additional terms and conditions apply with respect to the Mobile Applications:</p>

(“Apple”) or Google, Inc.
(“Google”).</li>

Disputes with Canary<p>
<i>Please read this carefully.
It affects your rights.</i>
</p>
<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting us at support@canary.is.
This section relates to disputes that may arise between you and Canary.
Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court, and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.
You have the right to opt out of this provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>
<p>
<i>Please read this provision carefully</i>.
All Disputes between you and Canary shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.
In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).
Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this provision, “Canary” means Canary and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
“Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Canary regarding any aspect of your relationship with Canary, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, or scope of this provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Canary’s licensors, suppliers, dealers, or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
<p>
<small>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</small>
</p>
<p>
<i>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</i>
</p>
<p>For all Disputes, you must first give Canary an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification of your dispute to Canary.
That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
If Canary does not resolve the Dispute within 60 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.
You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p>
<i>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</i>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or Canary may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, in which case it may be initiated in small claims court.
or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <i>WITHIN 30 DAYS</i> OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
You may opt out of this provision by mailing written notification to Canary.
Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Canary through arbitration.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p>
<p>
<i>Arbitration Procedures</i>
</p>
<p>The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.
All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this provision.</p>
<p>For arbitration before the AAA for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org.
For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures will apply.
The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.
This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>Because the Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
<p>Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties.</p>
<p>Location of Arbitration – You or Canary may initiate arbitration in either New York City, New York or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.
In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Canary may transfer the arbitration to New York City, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Canary will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.
You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.
Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.
In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Canary as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>
<i>Class Action Waiver</i>
</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and Canary specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</p>
<p>Neither you, nor any other user of the Site or Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
<p>
<i>Jury Waiver</i>
</p>
<p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Canary are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
In the absence of this provision, you and Canary might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p>
<i>Severability</i>
</p>
<p>If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision, and the remainder of this provision will be given full force and effect.
If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p>
<i>Continuation</i>
</p>
<p>This provision shall survive the termination of your service with Canary or its affiliates.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Canary makes any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Canary to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>
<p>
<strong>Governing Law &amp.
Venue</strong>

federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.

Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Services will be heard in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.</p>18.
Other Terms<p>If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.

<p>Canary’s Obligations</p>
<ol>
<li>Canary (as Processor) agrees with you (as Controller) that it shall:<ol>
<li>only process Video Feeds on your behalf and in compliance with your documented instructions and the Terms unless Canary is required to do so by mandatory EU or EU Member State law to which Canary is subject.
In such cases, Canary will inform you of that legal requirement before processing, where permitted to under that law;</li>
<li>taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in relation to Video Feeds implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk;</li>
<li>take reasonable steps to ensure that Canary’s personnel, agents and contractors that process your Video Feeds are subject to confidentiality undertakings or professional or statutory obligations of confidentiality;</li>
<li>taking into account the nature of the processing, assist you by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of your obligations to respond to requests to exercise data subject’s rights under the GDPR;</li>
<li>notify you without undue delay of becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach affecting your Video Feeds and taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to Canary, provide reasonable assistance to you to allow you to meet any obligations applicable to you in relation to such breaches under the GDPR;</li>
<li>taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Canary, provide reasonable assistance to you in relation to any mandatory obligations applicable to you in relation to the performance of data protection impact assessments or the carrying out of consultations with a Supervisory Authority under the GDPR, in each case solely in relation to the processing of your Video Feeds;</li>
<li>upon the expiration or termination of the Terms for any reason, at your election, return or delete all your Video Feeds in Canary’s possession and delete existing copies of your Video Feeds (unless Canary is required by mandatory EU or EU Member State law to retain the Personal Data);</li>
<li>provide written responses and documentary information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with Canary’s obligations under Clauses 5.1.1 - 5.1.7 above and, only to the extent required under Applicable Data Protection Law and where such compliance cannot be verified by providing you with evidence of Canary’s compliance, including without limitation evidence provided by an independent third party provider of compliance verification, allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by you or another auditor mandated by you and agreed to by Canary that relate to your Video Feeds.
For the avoidance of doubt, such audit shall be carried out no more than once in any 12-month period with reasonable notice, during regular business hours, in a manner which is not disruptive to Canary’s business and under a duty of confidentiality.
The scope of such an audit will be agreed in advance and shall not involve physical access to the servers from which the Services are provided.
You will bear the fees of any auditor and any expenses incurred by Canary in complying with this clause 5.1.8 and clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.6.
and</li>
<li>promptly inform you if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes Applicable Data Protection Law.</li>

and (b) Canary and its affiliates may engage third party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services.
As a condition to permitting a third-party Sub-processor to process your Video Feeds, Canary or a Canary affiliate will enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Video Feeds as those in this Addendum, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-processor.</li>
<li>A current list of Sub-processors, including the identities of those Sub-processors and their country of location, is available from Canary via a secured resource upon request.
Canary shall update this secured resource with the details of new Sub-processor(s) before authorizing such new Sub-processor(s) to process Video Feeds in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.
You agree to review the secured resource regularly in the context of such updates.</li>
<li>You may reasonably object to Canary’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying Canary promptly in writing within ten (10) business days after details of the new Sub-Processor have been added to the secured resource in accordance with clause 5.3.
Such notice shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection.
Canary may recommend a commercially reasonable change to your configuration or use of the Services to avoid processing of your Video Feeds by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening you.
If Canary is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the applicable subscription with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Canary without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party.</li>
<li>Canary shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Canary would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this Addendum.</li>
<li>If and to the extent that Canary, as Processor of your Video Feeds, proposes to transfer such Video Feeds outside the European Economic Area, Canary will carry out such transfers in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law.</li>
<li>If Canary determines that it can no longer meet any of its obligations arising under clause 5.1 of this Addendum, it shall notify you without delay.
In such a case, or if you have otherwise notified Canary of your determination that Canary cannot meet said obligations, Canary shall cease processing your Video Feeds and take other reasonable and appropriate remedial steps, including as directed by you.</li>
