Data protection.<p>Securing video and data is our top priority.
We built the Canary system to be
simple to use without sacrificing any of the safeguards that customers expect when
streaming and storing video.
All parts of our system—from the device to the
cloud to the app—employ extensive security measures to protect private data,
such as AES 256-bit symmetric-key encryption, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), secure
HTTP access (HTTPS) using TLS/SSL, and more.</p>Encryption and secure streaming.<p>When a customer streams video through the Canary app, all video and
data is securely encrypted between the device, the cloud, and the smartphone.
If a customer uses an open or insecure Wi-Fi network (or in the event their home
network is ever compromised), they can feel comfortable knowing their video and
data connection to the Canary Cloud is securely encrypted.</p>Storage in the Canary Cloud.<p>Canary offers free video storage on the Canary Cloud of events recorded
within the past 24 hours.
For those who want even more storage, we providethe ability to securely save up to 30 days of video through Canary Premium Service.</p>
<p>The Canary Cloud is strengthened by the power and security of Amazon Web Services
(AWS).
AWS data centers utilize state-of-the-art security measures and multi-factor
access control systems to ensure complete customer privacy.</p>
<p>For more information about Amazon’s security and infrastructure,please visit the AWS Security Center.</p>Privacy and security auditing for Canary devices.<p>We have strict internal policies and barriers in place to ensure that all
personal customer data remains private and secure within the Canary Cloud
at all times.
Only select Canary employees have access keys to systems that
contain sensitive customer information.
Authorized access to the Canary
Cloud is granted on a least-privilege basis.</p>
<p>Third-party security consultants audit our systems regularly.
We constantly
monitor the security landscape for new threats and potential risks, and improve
our system accordingly using proven technologies.
As improvements are made, the
Canary Cloud, Canary app, and embedded Canary firmware will be updated regularly
to provide users with our most recent security advancements.</p>Transparency and user accounts.<p>Our system balances personal privacy with principles of mutual trust and
transparency.
Individual users have unique passwords and login credentials
which are stored using a salted one-way hash function.
Users can also easily
customize settings to disable the camera and microphone.
Additionally, the
Canary app promotes information-sharing and visibility between members of
the same household.
the in-app timeline provides a shared view of what’s
actually happening at home, including mode changes, events, and activity.</p>Report Security Issues<p>If you have questions about our security practices or want to report a vulnerability, email security@canary.is.</p>
