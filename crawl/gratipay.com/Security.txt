<li>Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g.
phishing, vishing).</li>
<li>Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section.</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports with video only PoCs.</li>
<li>Reports that state that software is out of date/vulnerable without a proof of concept.</li>
<li>Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage.
Be concrete.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they're an issue.</li>
<li>Reports from automated web vulnerability scanners (Acunetix, Vega, etc.) that have not been validated.</li>
<li>Recently disclosed 0day vulnerabilities.
We need time to patch our systems just like everyone else - please give us 30 days before reporting these types of issues.</li>
<li>Issues in third-party services should be reported to the respective team.

</ul>Reporting <p>If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms, please send it to us on HackerOne.</p>
<p>Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps.
If a report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, it will not be eligible for a bounty.
We also ask you to cite references and not to copy/paste entire reports.
Reports copied entirely or mostly from elsewhere will not be eligible for a bounty.</p>
<p>We especially appreciate reports containing the affected code from our GitHub repository<i>
</i>, and possibly even patches, and we encourage you to test our platform by setting up Gratipay locally<i>
</i>.
That way you can test all sorts of payloads to your heart's content.</p> Awards <p>If you are the first to report an issue, and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue, we will award you:</p> Severity
