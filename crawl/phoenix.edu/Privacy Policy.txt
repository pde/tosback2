Some ads are targeted to your interests and preferences based on your browsing history, which is stored in a cookie on your computer.
Your browsing history on the Site may be tracked in these cookies even if ads are not being displayed.
By clicking on the AdChoices icon and following the instructions, you may adjust your privacy preferences.
