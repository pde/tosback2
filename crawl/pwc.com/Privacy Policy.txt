<p>The data controller collecting the data provided by a visitor to this website is the PwC firm in the visitor’s country or another PwC firm to which the visitor has submitted their data.
Personal data collected by a PwC firm may be transferred to other PwC firms  in connection with the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information.
By submitting data on this website, a visitor provides their explicit consent to the use of the data in accordance with this privacy statement, including the transborder transmission of data collected on the website for the fulfilment of their voluntary requests.</p>
Data collection 
<p>We collect only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors to this website.
PwC receives limited identifiable information, such as name, Title, company address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers, from website visitors.
Typically, identifying information is collected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register for certain areas of the site</li>
<li>Inquire for further information</li>
<li>Distribute requested reference materials</li>
<li>Submit resumes</li>
</ul>
<p>Demographic information, including gender and occupation, is not actively sought, but may be submitted when a visitor responds to an online job application.
It is PwC's policy to limit the information collected to only the minimum information required to complete a visitor's request.
In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection.</p>
<p>Although most publications are provided as downloads, visitors may also have the opportunity to purchase PwC publications either online, by calling toll free numbers, or by faxing order forms to our fulfilment houses.
We will collect order information and a customer's credit card information, where applicable, in order to facilitate shipment and payment for the publication.</p>
<p>Visitors are also able to send email through the site.
Their messages will contain the user's screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message.
Because we use the website as a recruiting tool, a visit to the website may also result in the user sending a resume to an individual within PwC.</p>
<p>PwC's intention is not to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting purposes.
Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin.
political opinions.
religious or other similar beliefs.
trade union membership.
physical or mental health.
sexual life or criminal record.
We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature.
If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, PwC accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.</p>

<p>A user may choose to provide personal information in the following examples:</p>
<ul>

<p>When a visitor provides personal information to us, we use it in connection with the purposes for which it was provided to us, as stated at the point of collection (or as obvious from the context of collection).
 This data is not shared with other entities in the network for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party other than as described in this statement or otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.
If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.</p>
<p>PwC makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.
If a visitor believes the site has collected excessive information, we encourage the visitor to contact us at privacy@pwc.com to raise any concerns.</p>
<p>Except for the mailing list initiative described above, where visitors explicitly choose to receive specific PwC marketing or other materials, PwC will not use personal data collected from our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.</p>
Cookies and log files 
<p>Cookies may be used on some pages of our site.
"Cookies" are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customised website experience.

It is PwC's policy to use cookies to make navigation of our websites easier for visitors and to facilitate efficient registration procedures.
Site statistics are compiled by third parties, and therefore your IP address will be passed to third parties for statistical reporting only.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about cookies, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies.
In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our websites, however other functionality in the site may be impaired.
After termination of the visit to our site, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.</p>
<p>In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types.
These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters.
This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.</p>

Third parties 
<p>It is PwC's policy only to disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>As required by law through subpoena, search warrant or other legal process</li>
<li>When explicitly requested by a visitor</li>
<li>When required to deliver publications or reference materials requested by a visitor</li>
<li>When required to facilitate conferences or events hosted by a third party</li>
</ul>
<p>PwC's policy is to disclose information to third parties upon visitors submitting their requests (e.g., when ordering a publication, we display the party fulfilling the order).</p>
<p>Some PwC publications are listed under Amazon.com in order to make it easier for visitors to purchase books online.
Visitors may search the PwC list of publications and then click a link to connect to the Amazon.com site in order to make a purchase.
The only information passed to the Amazon.com site is the publication that has been selected.
A visitor will then be required to register at the Amazon.com site in order to purchase the publication.
We recommend that you visit Amazon's privacy policy to learn more about their practices.</p>
<p>PwC websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties.</p>
<p>Personal data collected by PwC may be transferred or disclosed to third party service providers (and their subcontractors and subsidiaries) who process information on PwC’s behalf.
These service providers, subcontractors and subsidiaries include providers of information technology, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services.
They may be located outside the country where a visitor is located.
As a result, a visitor’s information may be transferred outside the country where they’re located.</p>
Third party links
<p>There are several places throughout pwcglobal.com and pwc.com that may link to other websites that do not operate under pwcglobal.com and pwc.com's privacy practices.
When you follow links to other websites, PwC's privacy practices no longer apply.
We encourage visitors to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.</p>
Data retention 
<p>Some of the information we receive is not retained.
For example, we usually do not keep mailing addresses for white papers.
Contact information about visitors (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information.
Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor's requests.
Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.</p>
Choices 
<p>As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the PwC websites.
In certain cases in the future, as your PwC website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information provided to PwC through this website is provided voluntarily by visitors.
Should visitors subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions on the appropriate website area or in communications to our visitors.
or a visitor may contact us at privacy@pwc.com.</p>
Access 
<p>Each visitor has the right of access to personal data they have submitted through the websites to PwC.</p>
<p>User updates of information should be handled by going back through the registration process.
Inquiries about the accuracy of identifying information previously submitted to PwC through this website, or requests to have outdated information removed, should be directed to privacy@pwc.com.
PwC is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies.
When requested and practical, PwC will delete identifying information from current operational systems.</p>
<p>When PwC retains personally identifiable information, PwC assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data.
PwC does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information.
When practically possible, if PwC is informed that any personal data collected through a website is no longer accurate, PwC will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor.</p>
Security 
<p>PwC has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.
PwC's policy is to use secure socket layer technology for the protection of credit card information submitted through web forms.
This policy is also required for any fulfilment agents of our firms.</p>
