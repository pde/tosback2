<p>BINDING ARBITRATION</p>
<p>Certain portions of this Arbitration section are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and POPSUGAR agree that we intend that this section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You and POPSUGAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to use or purchase of the Services or any aspect of the relationship between You and POPSUGAR.
This includes agreeing to arbitrate claims that arose before this Agreement came into effect and any claims that may arise after termination of this Agreement.
The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect.
Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.

AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.
If the specific provision of this paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Agreement titled "BINDING ARBITRATION" shall be null and void.</p>
<p>Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.
YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT.
THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
POPSUGAR shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond POPSUGAR's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference).
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM</p>
