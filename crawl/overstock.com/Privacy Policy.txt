<b>Security Methods</b>
<ul>
<li> We maintain technical, administrative, physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.

SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode the information.

<li> Please note that e-mail may not be encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.
“Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your information.

Though we might ask you your name, we will never request your password, credit card information or other information through e-mail.

<li>
<b>Information About Children</b>

We will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent.
If we become aware that an individual is under the age of 13 and has submitted any information to us, for any purpose without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her information from our files.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Additional Security</b>
<ul>
<li> We also ask customers to carefully review their accounts and immediately report any unexpected activity to us and their issuing bank or credit card company.
We ask all our customers to take measures to help protect information in their online accounts, including the following: <ul>
<li>Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses.</li>
<li>Reset your e-mail account passwords frequently.</li>
<li>Use complex passwords or passphrases</li>
<li>Do not use the same password on more than one website.</li>
<li>Do not share your password with others.</li>

</ul>
<br>INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER PRIVACY
<ul>
<li>Overstock is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</li>
<li>For most non-US transactions, we have partnered with third party companies (“Vendors”) that we have selected to help us facilitate international transactions.
We work closely with these Vendors to ensure that your transaction is handled with care and all the information you provide is secure.</li>
<li>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Overstock is potentially liable.</li>
<li>As an international customer, when you click on the checkout button, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by a Vendor to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be required to select a method of payment and submit credit card and other information to such Vendor to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be presented with the Vendor’s terms and conditions which you must agree to in order to complete your order.</li>
<li>Upon completion and approval of your order by such Vendor, the Vendor will notify us of the approval and we will process your order and cause it to be shipped directly to the Vendor.
In this process, the Vendor will purchase those items in your order from us, thereby taking title to the items, bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority (if applicable), and arrange for the delivery of your order.
In this process, the Vendor makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obligated to deliver your order as set forth in our Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li>Such Vendors must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.</li>
<li>If you have questions about your order, you should direct them to us and not to the Vendor.</li>
