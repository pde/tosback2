<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>"web browser" cookies - </strong>A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or device.
When you visit our websites, cookies allow us or our service providers to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie.<strong>
</strong>We and our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site (whether through the Internet or mobile applications). For instance, the data stored in cookies allows us and our service providers to understand how you clicked to our site and what pages you click on during your visit to our site, as well as how you use our mobile applications.
Knowing how you prefer to shop allows us to improve your shopping experience.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>                                                                                </p>
<p>
<strong>pixel tag - </strong>A "pixel tag" (also called a web beacon or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on website pages and in emails, advertising and other marketing communications that allows us and our service providers to determine whether you have performed specific actions.
When you access those pages or open email messages, or click on advertising, the pixel tags generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  That information is used to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site or mobile applications, and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail and advertising.</p>
<p>
<strong>wireless beacons</strong>  - A wireless beacon is a small device that we may use as part of our in-store experience.

<p>
<strong>technology used to serve advertising</strong>: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (e.g.
banners or links) tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop on jcpenney.com and other sites over time, and to perform tracking and reporting functions with respect to our ads.
We also allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our site and to use that information to serve ads for JCPenney products or services, or the products or services of other companies when you visit our site or other sites.
For instance, we and third-party vendors, such as Google, use first- and third-party cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to inform, optimize and serve ads based upon a user’s past visits to our website and to report upon how our ad impressions and other ad services are related to jcpenney.com.  We may combine and associate the information we collect through these technologies with other information we have collected from and about you.
This collective information may be used, among other things, for interest-based advertising (also called “online behavioral advertising”) in order to personalize your online experience, improve our website, evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising, and to tailor our marketing to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt-out of interest-based advertising, as well as the other choices described in the “your choices” section of this policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To learn more about interest-based advertising and how to “opt-out” of interest based advertising programs from participating companies, please go to the Network Advertising Initiative website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp or the Digital Advertising Alliance website at http://www.aboutads.info/.
Please note that the opt-outs you make on one or both of those websites only apply to the receipt of interest-based advertising from participating companies.  You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating companies, and the websites you visit may still collect information for other purposes.
Also, your opt-out status may be maintained by placement of an “opt-out” cookie on your computer.  If the cookie is removed or deleted, or you upgrade to a new version of your browser, change browsers or visit us from a different computer or device, you will need to repeat this process to indicate your opt-out preference.</p>
