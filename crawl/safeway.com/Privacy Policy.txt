 Introduction
<br>Albertson’s LLC, New Albertson’s, Inc., Safeway Inc., and each of their subsidiary entities, including your pharmacy, (hereinafter “Albertsons-Safeway”) are “affiliated entities” for purposes of HIPAA compliance and administration.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and understand the importance of safeguarding your personal health information.
We are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of health information that identifies you or that could be used to identify you (known as “Protected Health Information” or “PHI”).

This Notice describes your rights under federal law and state law, where applicable, relating to your PHI.
Albertsons-Safeway is required by federal law to abide by this Notice.
However, we reserve the right to change the privacy practices outlined in this Notice and make the new practices effective for all PHI that we maintain.
Should we make such a change, we will display the revised Notice at our pharmacies and make it available to you upon request.

YOUR RIGHTS
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
As a patient, you have certain rights regarding your PHI.
We require that you submit a written request to exercise a patient right, addressed to our HIPAA Privacy Office and delivered during regular business hours sufficiently in advance to allow us to administer your request as required.
These rights include:
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>A.
You have the right to request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information.</u> This means that you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your PHI for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations.
You may request that we not disclose PHI to your health plan if the disclosure is for purposes of payment or health care operations and is not otherwise required by law.
Albertsons-Safeway is obligated to honor this request when you have both submitted the request as required herein and you, or someone other than your health plan, have paid in full for the product or service.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
You may also request that any part of your PHI not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in your care.
Your request must state the specific restriction requested and state to whom you want the restriction to apply.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Albertsons-Safeway is not required to agree to such a restriction.
If we do agree, we will abide by your restriction unless we need to use your PHI to provide emergency treatment.
In addition, we may elect to terminate the restriction at any time.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>B.
You have the right to request to receive information from us by an alternative means or at an alternative location if you believe it would enhance your privacy.</u> For example, you may request that we send written communications to an alternative address.

</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>C.
You have the right to inspect and copy your Protected Health Information.</u> If you would like to see or obtain copies of your PHI that we maintain in a designated record set, we are required to provide you access to your PHI for inspection and copying within 30 days after receipt of your request (60 days if the information is stored off-site).
Alternatively, you have the right to request an electronic copy of your PHI, and we are required to provide it to you in a readable electronic form and format.
We may charge you a reasonable, cost-based fee to cover duplicating and mailing costs or the costs of preparation and transmission of PHI in electronic form.
In addition, there may be situations where we may decide to deny your request for access.
For example, we may deny your request if we believe the disclosure will endanger your life or health or that of another person.
Depending on the circumstances of the denial, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>D.

If we deny your request, we will send you a written explanation and allow you to submit a written statement of disagreement.
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>E.

This right generally applies to non-routine disclosures, i.e., for purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations, as described in this Notice, made in the six-year period prior to your request (although you are free to request an accounting for a shorter period).
We are required to provide the accounting within 60 days (with one 30-day extension, if needed) and to provide one accounting free of charge in any 12-month period.
