Last revised: April 26, 2012 WHAT IS YOUR PRIVACY STATEMENT? PRIVACY STATEMENT: To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as information from certain third parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a responsible manner.
We have posted this Privacy Statement on our website to let you know what kind of information we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use the information, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information.
As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of advances in technology, our Privacy Statement may change.
Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.
REGISTRATION POLICIES: To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with www.

com.
Using your email address and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete or change information retained in your account.
If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to close your browser at the conclusion of your session.
Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.
We encourage users to create a registered account on our website.
The benefit of having a registered account on UnderArmour.
com is having the ability to view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password.
When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information such as what sports you play.
The alternative to having a registered account is being a "Guest" visitor.
As a "Guest," you do not have access to past orders, or the benefit of storing your billing and shipping information on our site.
Unfortunately, we do not offer account registration at this time for International Consumers.
WHAT ARE YOUR SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICIES? SECURE ORDERING: We go to great lengths to protect your personal information.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information.
When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give a pop-up message stating that you're about to enter or leave a secure area.
Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the internet.
Our website has also earned a digital certificate from thawte, Inc.
When you see thawte's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted to our secure servers.
Ultimately your account and personal information is protected by the password you provided when you created your www.
UnderArmour.
com account.
Always keep this password and login information private, and never share it with anyone.
Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet café.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure.
Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our website.
We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us.

FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES UNDER ARMOUR COLLECT PIXEL TAGS AND COOKIES?

WHAT ARE PIXEL TAGS AND HOW DOES UNDER ARMOUR USE THEM? We use "pixel tags," (also known as “tracking pixels” or “web beacons”) which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our website.
The use of pixel tags is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see “What are Cookies and how does Under Armour use them?" below) on the computer previously placed by that server.
When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email.
One of the ways in which we use pixel tags is through a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.
They may collect anonymous (other than the IP address of your computer) information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services.
They may also use this information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.

NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS - YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS: Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.
83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law) requires that if a business has an established business relationship with a California resident and has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such resident’s personal information to a third party, knowing or having reason to know that such third party used the information for its direct marketing purposes, then the business must disclose such information-sharing to the resident upon request, including what personal information was shared, and with whom it was shared.
A business is deemed in compliance with this law if: (1) it has a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the customer’s consent (either opt-in or opt-out); and (2) it provides the customer upon request with a notice of his/her choice to prevent such sharing and a cost-free means to exercise that choice.
As a general matter, consent by “opt-in” means that a business will not share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer affirmatively consents to such sharing (e.
g.
, by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest consent).
On the other hand, consent by “opt-out” means that a business may share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer expressly disallows or objects to such sharing (e.
g.
, by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest disallowance or objection).
As stated above, Under Armour does not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless with your affirmative consent (i.
e.
, “opt-in”).
California residents may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to CustomerService@UnderArmour.
com.
Please note that, under the law, we are not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email address.
