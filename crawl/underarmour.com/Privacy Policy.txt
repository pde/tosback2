PRIVACY WHEN WAS THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT LAST UPDATED?
Last revised: October 19, 2012 WHAT IS YOUR PRIVACY STATEMENT?
<strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:</strong>
<br>
<br>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the "Shine the Light" law), California residents have a right to request certain information from each business they patronize regarding that business's disclosures of personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, together with a list of the categories of personal information that was disclosed.
The "Shine The Light" law creates an exception, however, for businesses that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures.
These businesses are not obligated to provide the list described above and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising those rights.
We qualify for this latter exception.
If you are a California resident, you may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to CustomerService@UnderArmour.com.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than through the contact information provided above.<br>
<br>To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as information from certain third parties.
Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a responsible manner.
We have posted this Privacy Statement on our website to let you know what kind of information we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use the information, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information.<br>
<br>Except where separate privacy terms are specified, this Privacy Statement applies to all information we collect or acquire from and about consumers through all media, channels and platforms, whether online, offline, print, telephonic, mobile, wireless, or otherwise, and whether existing now or in the future, including, without limitation through: (i) UA.com, UnderArmour.com, and other websites owned, controlled or operated by us, including mobile versions of these websites.
(ii) Under Armour-branded "consumer experience" channels, pages, and applications (including mobile applications, widgets, applets, plug-ins, etc.) that are hosted on third-party sites and platforms, including those hosted on third-party social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Google/YouTube).
(iii) events and promotions sponsored or hosted by us, whether alone or jointly with others (e.g., sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, sales promotions, athletic events, etc.).
and (iv) other data collection, acquisition and marketing channels (e.g., direct mail, paper and phone enrollments, cross-sell programs, loyalty programs, and affiliate marketing).<br>
<br>As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of advances in technology, our Privacy Statement may change.
Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.<br> WHAT ARE YOUR SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICIES?
<strong>SECURE ORDERING:</strong>
<br>
<br>We go to great lengths to protect your personal information.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information.
When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL.
also, your browser may give a pop-up message stating that you're about to enter or leave a secure area.
Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the internet.
When you see VeriSign's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted to our secure servers.
Ultimately, if you register an account with our website, your account and personal information is protected by the password you provide when you created your account.
Always keep this password and login information private, and never share it with anyone.
Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet café.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure.
Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our website.
We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us.
By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.<br>
<br>
<strong>REGISTRATION POLICIES:</strong>
<br>
<br>To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with www.UnderArmour.com.
Using your email address and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete or change information retained in your account.<br>
<br>If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to close your browser at the conclusion of your session.
Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.<br>
<br>We encourage users to create a registered account on our website.
The benefit of having a registered account on UnderArmour.com is having the ability to view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password.
When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information such as what sports you play.<br>
<br>The alternative to having a registered account is being a "Guest" visitor.
As a "Guest," you do not have access to past orders, or the benefit of storing your billing and shipping information on our site.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, we do not offer account registration at this time for International Consumers.
WHAT TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES UNDER ARMOUR GATHER?
<strong>INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US:</strong>
<br>
<br>We receive and store any information you submit on our website or give us in any other way.
You can choose not to provide certain information but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
By usage of our website or through registration on our website, you grant us the permission to process your personal data that has been provided to us via the Under Armour website in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Statement.
We use the information that you provide for such purposes as processing your order, responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our website, and communicating with you.<br>
<br>Should you decide to register an account with the Under Armour website, personal data that we will collect, store and use are the following: name and email address.
Additionally, you have the option of providing your gender, birth date, sports interests, shipping/billing address, daytime phone number, size and team number.<br>
<br>Should you place an order, personal data that we will collect, store and use are the following: name, billing address, shipping address, credit card number and expiration date, email address and phone number.<br>
<br>
<strong>AUTOMATIC INFORMATION</strong>
<br>
<br>When you visit our website, we receive and store certain types of information through automatic data collection tools including cookies, pixel tags, Web beacons, embedded Web links and other commonly used information gathering tools (“Automatic Data Collection Tools”).
These Automatic Data Collection Tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, IP address, user-agent string and click stream behavior (i.e., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions that you take in connection with our website).
Please see below for more information about our use of cookies and pixel tags.<br>
<br>
<strong>INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES:</strong>
<br>
<br>If you have registered an account with us or placed an order through our website, to help us customize shopping for you, improve our communication with you, and improve our business overall, we may obtain certain demographic information about you from reputable third party sources such as Axciom Corporation.
For example, in the event we determine that you live in a geographical area where the climate is usually cold and you have subscribed to receive email communications from us, we would be more likely to send you communications highlighting our ColdGear® product line rather than our HeatGear® product line.
FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use the information that you provide to us via our website only for the following purposes: processing and fulfilling your order, responding to your requests and your product inquiries, direct marketing, customizing future shopping for you, improving our website, communicating with you and for our financial accounting purposes.
Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention.<br>
<br>
<strong>ORDER PLACEMENT:</strong>
<br>
<br>Once you decide to place an order, if you are not a registered customer, you will be given the option to register an account with our website or to place an order as a guest only.
If you choose to become a registered customer, your personal information will be saved on our system to facilitate your future purchases on our website.
Also, as a registered customer, you will have the ability to view your order history on our website.
On the other hand, if you choose to place the order as a guest only, none of your personal information will be saved by us upon completion of your order except as may be reasonably necessary to document our business activities or as needed for required disclosures.
Please see the paragraph “What are your registration policies?” below for more information about your options to place an order as a registered customer or as a guest.<br>
<br>
<strong>EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS:</strong>
<br>
<br>To help us make email communication more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open email messages from www.UnderArmour.com if your computer supports such capabilities.
We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
If you do not want to receive email messages or other communications from us, please see the paragraph on “How do I opt out of receiving communications from Under Armour?” below.<br>
<br>
<strong>DIRECT MARKETING:</strong>
<br>
<br>Each registered customer has the choice of receiving announcements about our products and special events or promotions from us via postal mail, email and/or text messaging.
You will receive promotional postal mail or email messages from us only if you have agreed to receive them by (i) leaving the check in the box next to the invitation to receive Under Armour news and promotions when entering your shipping and billing information to place an order or when registering, or (ii) clicking on “Email Signup” at the top of the website home page and entering your email address.
You will receive promotional text messages from us only if you have agreed to receive them by providing your mobile phone number when you register your account or at checkout.
FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES UNDER ARMOUR COLLECT PIXEL TAGS AND COOKIES?
<strong>PURPOSES FOR WHICH PIXEL TAGS AND COOKIES ARE USED:</strong>
<br>
<br>We use pixel tags and cookies to customize our web pages based upon purchases a visitor has made, to track (in the aggregate and not in terms of individual site visitors) the number of visitors to the site, the paths to the site, activity on the website and purchases, to enable interaction of our website with visitors for purposes such as adding items to a customer’s shopping cart, and to tailor advertisements which appear on other sites a visitor may visit to a visitor’s Web preferences and usage patterns.
For additional information about pixel tags and cookies the ways in which we use them, please see the questions <strong>“What are Pixel Tags and how does Under Armour use them?”</strong> and <strong>“What are Cookies and how does Under Armour use them”</strong> below.
WHAT ARE PIXEL TAGS AND HOW DOES UNDER ARMOUR USE THEM?
We use "pixel tags," (also known as “tracking pixels” or “web beacons”) which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our website.
The use of pixel tags is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears.
the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears.
the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed.
the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag.
and the identification number of any cookie (please see “What are Cookies and how does Under Armour use them?" below) on the computer previously placed by that server.
When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email.
One of the ways in which we use pixel tags is through a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.
They may collect anonymous (other than the IP address of your computer) information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services.
They may also use this information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.
If you would like more information about online marketing practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party service providers, please click <strong>www.networkadvertising.org</strong>.
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DOES UNDER ARMOUR USE THEM?
A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive.
It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) when you enter our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us.
That customer information is stored on our secured database.

<br>We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management.<br>
<br>We may also use single pixel images on our website.
