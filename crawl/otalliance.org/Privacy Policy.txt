Doing so will facilitate prompt and efficient communication of time-sensitive information that can both limit the occurrence and impact of online crime and identity theft.</p> Fri, Nov 21, 2014 The Promise of Ad Supply Chain Accountability <p>A few weeks ago, I attended the IAB Ad Operations Summit.
The Summit focused on cleaning up the advertising supply chain, combating fraud, and identifying more streamlined ways to accurately measure ad performance.
The underlying message of the Summit was the need for collaboration and industry buy-in.
Just as standardization is impossible unless everyone is committed to following the same standards, cleaning up the supply chain is impossible unless everyone agrees to identify and shut out disreputable players.</p> Tue, Nov 18, 2014 Big Data Are You Prepared to Seize Opportunities &amp.
