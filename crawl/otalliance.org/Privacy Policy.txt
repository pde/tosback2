</ul> Tue, Jun 20, 2017 2017 Online Trust Audit Released - What Did We Learn? <p>Today we released the 9th annual Online Trust Audit and Honor Roll.
This year’s Audit is our most comprehensive ever, assessing more than 1000 consumer-facing sites for their adoption of best practices in consumer/brand protection, site security and responsible privacy practices.</p> Mon, Jun 5, 2017 Whitelisting Ads Vs.
Scorched Earth: What's The Best Approach? <p>By some accounts, there are more than 200 variants of ad-blocking solutions, many of which utilize whitelisting that allows certain ads through when they adhere to specific rules.
While an ad blocker that doesn’t block all ads may sound like an oxymoron, I argue that whitelisting may be critical for the long-term sustainability of ad-supported services.</p> Mon, Apr 10, 2017 Responsible, Coordinated &amp.
