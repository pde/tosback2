In an age when the future in privacy is a blur, find clarity at the Summit.</p> Wed, May 24, 2017 Planning for the Future: A Conference About Identity Theft <p>Ten years ago, President Bush launched a new era in the fight against identity theft by issuing an executive order establishing the Identity Theft Task Force, which the Commission co-chaired.
In the ensuing ten years, great strides have been made to combat identity theft but it remains a significant problem for American consumers.
The Federal Trade Commission will host an all-day conference to take a comprehensive look at how identity theft has evolved over the last decade and what we can do to address this challenge in the future.</p> Tue, Oct 17, 2017 Privacy, Risk, Security 2017 <p>Privacy.

<strong>Guest Blog from Pascal Millaire, Symantec</strong>
</p>
<p> We are entering a new era for global insurers, where business interruption claims are no longer confined to a limited geography, but can simultaneously impact seemingly disconnected insureds globally.
This creates new forms of systemic risks that could threaten the solvency of major insurers if they do not understand the silent and affirmative cyber risks inherent in their portfolios.  </p> Mon, Nov 7, 2016 Responsible, Coordinated &amp.
Ethical Vulnerability Disclosures <p>As a participant of NTIA’s multi-stakeholder vulnerability working group and an attendee to this week’s meeting in DC, I was impressed by the level of collaboration and sharing of best practices.  Progress is encouraging.</p> More &gt;&gt.
