</ul> Sun, Jan 24, 2016 Donor Data.
the New Currency for Presidential Candidates, Time for ethical data privacy practice <p>Voter data is the new currency and candidates are reaping the rewards targeting voters and ultimately determining who will be the next President.
As we have transformed into a data driven society and economy this may be expected.

 As we head into the State primaries and caucuses, this data is proving to be invaluable.</p> Tue, Dec 15, 2015 Top Ten Practices: Correct Collection Leads to Improved Connection <p>For the past several years, marketers have been capturing email addresses at brick-and-mortar locations.

Trust in our relationship has shifted from blind innocence to practical, mature action.
