the Next Fashion Statement Do consumers know the true price they may be paying?
Innovation in personal connected devices, aka the Internet of Things (IoT), has the enticing promise of enabling consumers with a wide range of function and benefits.
These advancements are leap frogging what we have realized from smartphones and mobile apps.
We are a data driven society and economy, and increasingly conscious of the opportunity the data these devices can provide.
