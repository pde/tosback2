<p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services.
We reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times contain sufficient information for us to be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>

No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats.
If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.</p> SECURITY <p>Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website.
We take precautions to protect your personally identifiable information but no computer system is completely secure.

If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).</p> CHANGES TO THIS POLICY <p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes.
Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.</p> GOVERNING LAW <p>This policy and the use of this Website are governed by Illinois law.
The exclusive jurisdiction for any claim, dispute, or litigation (“Litigation”) arising out of the operation of the Website or this policy shall be vested in the federal and state courts located in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, and such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of any such Litigation.
