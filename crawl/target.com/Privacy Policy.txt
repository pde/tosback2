<p>
<em>Automated Information Collection</em>
</p>
<p>We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device.
This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms and IP-based geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant.
This includes Target content presented on another website or mobile application, for example, Target Weekly Ad.
These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and Short Message Service (SMS)/text messages you have chosen to receive.
We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention purposes.
</p>
<p>In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.</p>
<p>
<em>Third-Party Automated Collection</em>
</p>
<p>Target participates in online behavioral advertising (OBA), also known as interest-based advertising.
We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.
Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for OBA.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website.
We use this information to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites.
These companies use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g.
IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Our Do Not Track Policy:</strong> Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of behavioral advertising.
To learn more about OBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website or Digital Advertising Alliance website.
Options you select are browser and device-specific.
</p> User Experience Information <p>In order to improve guest online shopping experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our guest relations representatives in resolving issues guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information.
including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g.
information entered during checkout process), and browser information.</p> Social Media Widgets <p>Target.com includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets.
These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.
Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p> Information from Other Sources <p>We collect data that’s publicly available.
For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g.
a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience.
You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.</p>
<p>We also obtain information provided by a third party.
For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing guest information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our guests (for example, adding address information).</p>
<p>This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you.
