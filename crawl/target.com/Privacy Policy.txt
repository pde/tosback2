<b>Automated Information Collection</b>
</p>
<p>We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target guest.
If we are able to identify you as a Target guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile applications.
This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us — online, in store, mobile, etc.</p>
<p>In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes.
We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.</p>
<p>
<i>Target Automated Collection</i>
</p>
<p>We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device.
This information, which includes, but is not limited to: the pages you visit on our site or mobile application, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms, and IP-based geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant.
This includes Target content presented on another website or mobile application, for example, Target Weekly Ad.
These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and Short Message Service (SMS)/text messages you have chosen to receive.
We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>
<i>Third-Party Automated Collection and Interest-Based Advertising</i>
</p>
<p>Target participates in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising.
We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.
Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications.
This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites.
These companies use non-personally-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon, or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information.</p>
<p>
<b>Our Do Not Track Policy:</b> Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of interest based advertising.
To learn more about IBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
Options you select are browser and device-specific.</p>
<p>
<b>Mobile Location Information</b>
</p>
<p>If you have downloaded one or more of our mobile applications, you can opt-in to location sharing for additional application capabilities.
For example, geo-location will use your device’s latitude and longitude or your device’s location capabilities (e.g.
GPS or Wi-Fi) to let you find nearby Target stores.
Or, in-store location through the use of beacons, your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies, or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more.
To learn how to opt-out of sharing your location with Target, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
<b>User Experience Information</b>
</p>
<p>In order to improve guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our guest relations representatives in resolving issues guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information.
including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g.
information entered during checkout process), and browser information.</p>
<p>
<b>Targeted TV Ads</b>
</p>
<p>We may display targeted ads to you through your cable or satellite TV provider.
These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics.
We receive this information from third party sources.
For example, we may target TV ads to guests who have expressed an interest in shopping for groceries, cosmetics, clothing, etc.
The ads may also be based on personal information you have provided your cable or satellite TV provider.
We do not share any of your personal information, including your shopping history, with your cable or satellite TV provider.
See your cable or satellite TV provider’s privacy policy for additional information about targeted TV Ads, including how you can opt out of receiving such ads.</p>
<p>

In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use.</p>
<p>
<i>Social Media Widgets</i>
</p>
<p>Our sites and mobile applications include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets.
These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.
Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>
