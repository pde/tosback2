 Visitor Agreement <p>Last Updated: <strong>March 31, 2013</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to AutoTrader.com, a service of AutoTrader.com, Inc.
By using this website, you accept the terms of this Visitor Agreement.
This is a legally binding agreement between you and AutoTrader.com.
please read it carefully.</p>
<p>
<strong>General Provisions</strong>
</p>
<p> AutoTrader.com respects your privacy.
Please take a moment to review our privacy statement.
</p>
<p> We invite you to bring to our attention any material on our website that you believe to be inaccurate.
Please forward a copy of the material to our Customer Service Manager, along with an explanation of your objection.
</p>
<p> AutoTrader.com may change the terms of this Visitor Agreement from time to time.
By continuing to use this website following our posting of such changes, you agree to be bound by this Visitor Agreement, as modified.
AutoTrader.com may change, restrict access to, suspend, or discontinue this website, or any portion of this website, at any time.
</p>
<p> The material that appears on the AutoTrader.com website is for informational purposes only.
Despite our efforts to provide useful and accurate information, errors may appear from time to time.
Before purchasing a vehicle or other goods or services you've read about on AutoTrader.com, you should confirm with the seller any information (including the price) that is important to your purchasing decision.
AutoTrader.com is not responsible for, and does not guarantee the performance of, any such vehicles, goods or services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Buying and Selling Vehicles</strong>
</p>
<p> AutoTrader.com is a vehicle listing and information service that brings together buyers and sellers.
Information about a particular vehicle is supplied by the seller, not by AutoTrader.com.
The price and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller.
The prices listed by sellers on AutoTrader.com often exclude sales tax, finance charges, title, license, regulatory, dealer documentary, emission testing and compliance fees, any or all of which may be added to the listed price to arrive at the final sale price of a particular vehicle.
Though we hope that all who come to AutoTrader.com will act honorably and treat each other fairly, we cannot verify the information that sellers supply or guarantee the vehicles they offer.
Nor can we assure the seller of a vehicle that the check he/she gets from the buyer isn't going to bounce.
When using this website to find a buyer for your vehicle or a vehicle you can buy, we urge you to use the same common sense and good judgment you would use in selling a car through, or responding to, a classified ad in the newspaper.
</p>
<p> Please read our fraud awareness tips before you buy or sell a car through a classified ad, whether on AutoTrader.com or in your local newspaper.
There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.
</p>
<p> In connection with our efforts to combat Internet fraud, some listings may be screened before being posted publicly.
This process may delay display of your listing.
We may also screen some email messages sent to sellers about vehicles listed on AutoTrader.com.
If it appears that your email message has not reached the seller of the vehicle you are inquiring about, you might try inquiring by telephone if the seller has provided a telephone number.
</p>
<p> In order to offer a vehicle for sale through AutoTrader.com, you must agree to the Terms of Sale for the Sell Your Car service, which will be presented to you at the time you purchase your ad.
The Terms of Sale require, among other things, that you be prepared to sell that vehicle at the price at which, and the terms on which, you have listed it, and that you have possession of the actual vehicle listed and the ability to transfer title.
To list a vehicle for sale on AutoTrader.com, sellers also are required to provide certain identifying and contact information.
The information must accurately identify the seller and the method of contact must permit buyers to communicate directly with the seller.
You may not charge any potential buyer for information about any vehicle listed for sale on AutoTrader.com, nor may you use our website to promote, without our prior written permission, any other website, product or service.
Sell Your Car ads are available only to private sellers who want to list their vehicles for sale.
</p>
<p> Sell Your Car ads are not to be used to advertise more than one vehicle per ad purchased, regardless of ad duration.
For this reason, you cannot edit your vehicle's Year, Make, Model or VIN once you've purchased your ad.
Always double-check this information before submitting your ad.
</p>
<p> Individuals who seek to list more than five vehicles on the AutoTrader.com website simultaneously, and all dealers, must make other arrangements with us.
To find out more about listing and advertising opportunities on AutoTrader.com, visit weworkforyou.com.
By using our Sell Your Car service, you represent that you are not a motor vehicle dealer, that you are not listing a vehicle for sale in your capacity as an owner, employee or representative of a dealer, and that neither you, nor anyone acting on your behalf will list more than five vehicles for sale simultaneously.
AutoTrader.com reserves the right to deny use of this website to anyone who does not comply with these requirements or who otherwise uses our website in a manner we consider inappropriate.
</p>
<p> AutoTrader.com offers a variety of ad packages, with combinations of features that vary by market area.
For information about the ad packages available to private sellers in your area, click the "Sell Your Car" tab or button on our home page.
On the next page, enter your ZIP code to view our product offerings.
If you are a Dealer customer, please visit weworkforyou.com for more information.
</p>
<p> When you list a vehicle for sale through our Sell Your Car service, we may obtain additional distribution for your listing through our relationships with other websites, including Univision, MSN Autos, MSN Latino, and NADA Guides.
We also may promote your listing on or through third-party websites or services.
Neither AutoTrader.com nor any website through which we distribute or promote your listing will charge you any additional fee for this additional exposure.
It is just added value from AutoTrader.com.
Further, none of our distribution or promotional partners will directly contact you regarding your advertising unless you expressly grant them the right to do so.
If you ever receive a call or email from a third party company offering add-on advertising services, they have likely misused AutoTrader.com's website and violated our Visitor Agreement to exploit your listing information.
Additionally, they may be in violation of federal telemarketing law and other law, and they may not even be a legitimate company.
If they claim that they are an AutoTrader.com partner, that is false advertising.
</p>
<p> Responsibility for the information contained in each listing lies with each seller.
You alone are responsible for material you post and for the content of all email messages you transmit through AutoTrader.com.
Nothing will undermine a user's confidence in the vehicle you're looking to sell faster than inaccurate statements or misleading representations about the vehicle.
And since any erosion of user confidence in you is likely to be accompanied by erosion of user confidence in us, we care deeply about making sure that the information you supply is accurate and that, in all respects, you treat other AutoTrader.com users fairly and honorably.
</p>
<p> Though we cannot monitor every transaction that originates through a listing on AutoTrader.com, we may perform random quality assurance tests to confirm that those who offer vehicles for sale over AutoTrader.com are prepared to sell the vehicles they advertise at the prices at which, and the terms on which, they advertise them.
By using our Sell Your Car service, you agree to cooperate in these random quality assurance tests.
If our tests reveal, or we otherwise learn, that a seller is engaging in "bait and switch" or other unfair or deceptive practices, AutoTrader.com reserves the right to deny that seller use of the Sell Your Car service.
</p>
<p> By placing an ad through our Sell Your Car service, you agree to pay the fees specified for the package you select, regardless of whether your vehicle sells as a result of the listing.
Take care in selecting your ad package and inputting your ad information.
listing fees are generally not refundable, even if you provide erroneous information or fail to sell your vehicle.
Click here for our Refund Policy.
</p>
<p> Our used car listings include vehicles that have been "certified" as meeting certain standards established by manufacturers and/or dealers in connection with their pre-owned vehicle programs.
The decision to certify any particular vehicle is made by the certifying manufacturer or dealer, and the vehicle information included in AutoTrader.com's certified vehicle listing is provided by the listing dealer.
Neither AutoTrader.com nor the manufacturer is responsible for the accuracy of any information contained in a certified vehicle listing and only the manufacturer or dealer that certifies a vehicle is responsible for the decision to certify that vehicle.
You should familiarize yourself with the terms of the applicable certification program before buying any certified vehicle.
Ads purchased by private sellers through our Sell Your Car service will not appear in any "certified" area of our website.
Our certified ads apply only to vehicles certified by the automobile manufacturers with which we have partnerships.

<strong>AutoTrader.com Trade-In Marketplace Program</strong>
</p>
<p> To redeem an offer that you have received through the AutoTrader.com Trade-In Marketplace (the "Program"): (1) your vehicle must be located in a market in which the Program is offered.
(2) you must be the registered owner of the vehicle in question.
(3) you must possess a valid driver's license or other form of valid government-issued photo ID.
(4) you must not be an automobile dealer or an employee or agent of an automobile dealer.
(5) you must provide us with accurate, complete and truthful personal contact information and responses to all questions included in our online questionnaire regarding the description and condition of your vehicle.
and (6) you must deliver your vehicle, with a valid registration and either clear and unencumbered title in your name, or complete documentation regarding any lease obligations or liens on your vehicle (including, for example, contact information for your lender or leasing company, relevant account information and the current loan payoff amount or lease early termination fee for your vehicle) within 72 hours of the issuance of your Trade-In Marketplace offer (your "Offer") to a participating dealer in our network (a "Participating Dealer").
The Participating Dealer will inspect your vehicle to confirm its condition and the other information that you entered about your vehicle online.
Based on the results of the confirmation inspection reported by the Participating Dealer, the Program may adjust the dollar amount of your Offer up or down prior to redemption.
</p>
<p> The Program is not available in all areas and not all vehicles are eligible for Offers.
The Program may not be used to sell or trade in current model year (or newer) vehicles, commercial vehicles, vehicles with a police, fire, livery or taxi history, reconstructed or salvage vehicles, vehicles without a valid Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), vehicles not originally built for the United States market or that were imported illegally or outside of official manufacturer channels (i.e., "gray market" vehicles), vehicles older than 17 model years, vehicles with altered drivelines or bodies or illegal or non-functioning emissions equipment, vehicles registered at an auto auction or offered for sale on a wholesale website within 45 days, and vehicles that we would value at less than $1,000.
You may use the Program to sell or trade in a maximum of 3 vehicles in any six-month period.
Vehicles with an Offer value greater than $75,000 may not be accepted by every Participating Dealer and may require an additional inspection.
</p>
<p> Although the majority of Offers generated by the Program will be delivered within moments of submitting a valid request, some requests require manual review.
This manual review process usually will be completed within minutes of submitting a request but occasionally may take until the next business day.
</p>
<p> You acknowledge that if you provide us with any false, incomplete or inaccurate information, including, without limitation, vehicle information or personal contact information, your Offer will be immediately invalidated.
By requesting an Offer, you agree that AutoTrader.com and its service providers and Participating Dealers may use your personal contact information, including your telephone number and email address, to communicate with you about the Program and about vehicles or other products and services that may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p> There are two types of Participating Dealers in the Program.
Your Offer will identify Participating Dealer(s) as either "Buying Centers" or "Trade-In Centers." If you redeem your Offer at a Buying Center, you will have the option of either using your Offer to trade in your vehicle or to sell your car for a check.
If you redeem your Offer at a Trade-In Center, you will be able to use your Offer for trade-in purposes and, at the dealer's discretion, you may also be able to redeem your Offer for a check.
If your Offer does not identify the Buying Center nearest to you, please call our Trade-in Marketplace customer service department at 1-866-545-4059 or send us an email to request this information.
None of the Participating Dealers are owned or operated by AutoTrader.com or otherwise affiliated with AutoTrader.com.
</p>
<p> Your Participating Dealer will conduct a mandatory vehicle inspection free of charge to confirm the vehicle description and condition information that you provided to us online.
This confirmation inspection may include, for example, paint thickness measurements, a road test, a mechanical inspection and review of vehicle history reports and disclosure statements regarding flood, salvage or odometer discrepancies (including rollbacks), and the like.
The dealer will submit the results of the confirmation inspection to the Program using the same online tool that you used to request your Offer and we may raise or lower the dollar amount of your Offer prior to redemption based on the information revealed by the inspection.
All decisions of the Participating Dealer regarding the condition of your vehicle will be final.
</p>
<p> At the conclusion of your vehicle confirmation inspection, you can redeem your Offer, subject to any applicable post-inspection adjustments made by the Program, by delivering your vehicle on the spot or by returning your vehicle to the Participating Dealer's location by the end of the next business day in the same condition and with no more than 50 additional miles on the odometer.
If your confirmation inspection was conducted by a Buying Center (or another Participating Dealer that chooses to purchase vehicles through the Program) and you decide to redeem your Offer by selling your vehicle, the dealer will issue you a check following the release of any applicable liens and lease obligations and the dealer's receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title.
All checks will be made payable to the vehicle owner(s) named on the vehicle title.
If you elect to redeem your Offer by trading-in your vehicle, your Participating Dealer will issue you a trade-in credit against the sale price of any vehicle available in its inventory following the release of all applicable liens and lease obligations and the receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title.
If you have negative equity in your vehicle (<em>i.e.</em>, your outstanding loan balance or lease payment obligation exceeds the amount of your Offer), you will be responsible for paying the difference between the Offer and the amount needed to clear the title to your vehicle by certified check or other form of payment acceptable to the Participating Dealer before your transaction can be completed.
If you have positive equity in your vehicle, the Participating Dealer will issue you a check or a trade-in credit, as applicable, for the difference between the amount needed to clear the title to your vehicle and the Offer.
Your Participating Dealer will assist you with the processing of the paperwork and payments necessary to settle your loan or lease obligations and to obtain a clear title to your vehicle.
This process typically takes 10 to 14 days following delivery of a vehicle to a Participating Dealer, but could take longer in some circumstances.
</p>
<p> Although your Participating Dealer is not obligated to purchase your vehicle or accept your vehicle for trade for any price other than the amount of your Offer, you can try to negotiate a more favorable price or trade-in value for your vehicle and, of course, you are always free to sell or trade-in your vehicle outside of the Program.
The sale price or trade-in value that you could receive for your vehicle in the open market may be more favorable than the amount of your Offer received through our Program.
</p>
<p> BY REDEEMING A TRADE-IN MARKETPLACE OFFER, YOU COVENANT NOT TO SUE AUTOTRADER.COM, ITS AFFILIATES, SERVICE PROVIDERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "RELEASED PARTIES") FOR, AND AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RELEASED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY VEHICLE SALE OR TRADE-IN TRANSACTION THAT YOU ENTER INTO WITH A PARTICIPATING DEALER.
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ARISE OUT OF SUCH A TRANSACTION, YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO YOUR PARTICIPATING DEALER FOR YOUR REMEDY AND NOT TO THE RELEASED PARTIES.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
</p>
<p> For your convenience, we make available a variety of links to other websites that we don't operate where you can obtain automotive related products and services, including insurance, warranties, financing and inspection services.
Although we encourage you to consult such websites, we cannot guarantee the prices, terms, quality, reliability or performance of the products or services provided by these vendors.
AutoTrader.com is not responsible for the products or services these vendors provide.
You may choose to purchase an inspection through such a third-party website for a vehicle advertised on our website that you are interested in buying.
Remember that an inspection is not a warranty, however.
Although inspections can be of significant value in the purchase of a pre-owned car, an inspection is not a guarantee that the inspected car is free from defects or that the inspectors have identified all existing defects.
Before you purchase inspection services, you should confirm with the inspector the location at which the inspection will be conducted, the scope and price of the inspection, and any other information you consider important to your decision.
You are responsible for coordinating and arranging for the inspection.
You release AutoTrader.com and its affiliates from any damages that you may incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your purchase or use of third-party supplied products and services.
</p>
<p> For your convenience, we make available links to websites operated by car dealerships that list their cars on the AutoTrader.com website.
Although we or our affiliates may power some of these dealer websites, we are not responsible for any of the content that appears on these websites, including, without limitation, promotional contests and sweepstakes offers.
We do not co-sponsor, operate, endorse or guarantee any advertiser sweepstakes or contest offer that may be promoted from time to time on our website, or that may be accessible through a link from our website, and you release AutoTrader.com and its affiliates from any damages that you may incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your entry, participation or acceptance of any prize in any such sweepstakes or contest offer.
