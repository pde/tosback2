</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in AutoTrader.
In this Visitor Agreement, the terms "AutoTrader.com," "we," "us," and "our" refer to AutoTrader.com, Inc.
and the terms "you" and "your" refer to you as a user of our websites, mobile and other online applications and products and services (collectively, the AutoTrader Sites).</p>
<ol>
<li> General Provisions <ol>
<li>By using the AutoTrader Sites, you accept the terms of this Visitor Agreement.
This is a legally binding agreement between you and AutoTrader.com.
please read it carefully.
When using the AutoTrader Sites, you may be subject to other posted terms and guidelines applicable to certain services available on or through the AutoTrader Sites.
All terms and guidelines on the AutoTrader Sites, including our Privacy Statement, are part of this Visitor Agreement and incorporated herein by reference.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any features or services available at any time on the AutoTrader Sites are subject to this Visitor Agreement.
Accessing the AutoTrader Sites in any manner, even through automated means, constitutes your use of the AutoTrader Sites and your agreement to be bound by this Visitor Agreement.
AutoTrader.com may change the terms of this Visitor Agreement from time to time and will revise the effective date when it does so.
Your continued use of the AutoTrader Sites after the posted effective date constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Visitor Agreement as modified, except that modifications do not apply to any dispute arising prior to their effective date.
AutoTrader.com may change, restrict access to, suspend, or discontinue the AutoTrader Sites, or any portion thereof.</li>
<li>The material that appears on the AutoTrader Sites is for general informational purposes only.
While we aim to provide a site that is useful, be mindful that the AutoTrader Sites may, from time to time, contain errors.
The AutoTrader Sites includes materials and information collected from and provided by third parties that we may not have evaluated or reviewed.
We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of any of the materials or information on the AutoTrader Sites, and you should not rely on it without independent verification.
</li>
<li>We invite you to bring to our attention any materials or information on the AutoTrader Sites that you believe to be inaccurate.
Please forward a copy of the materials or information to our Customer Service Manager, along with an explanation of the inaccuracies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Buying and Selling Vehicles <ol>
<li>The AutoTrader Sites is a vehicle listing and information service that brings together buyers and sellers.
AutoTrader.com is not a party to any transaction between vehicle buyers and sellers that originates on or through the AutoTrader Sites.
Information about a particular vehicle is supplied by the seller, not by AutoTrader.com.
The price and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller.</li>
<li>Though we hope that all who come to the AutoTrader Sites will act honorably and treat each other fairly, we cannot verify the information that sellers supply or guarantee the vehicles they offer.
Nor can we assure the seller of a vehicle that the payment he or she receives from the buyer is legitimate.
When using the AutoTrader Sites to find a buyer for your vehicle or a vehicle to purchase, we urge you to use the same common sense and good judgment you would use in selling a vehicle through, or responding to, a classified ad in the newspaper.</li>
<li>Please read our fraud awareness tips before you buy or list a vehicle on the AutoTrader Sites.
There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.</li>
<li> Buying a Vehicle <ol>
<li>The prices listed by sellers on the AutoTrader Sites often exclude sales tax, finance charges, title, license, regulatory, dealer documentary, emission testing, and compliance fees, any or all of which may be added to the listed price to arrive at the final sale price of a particular vehicle.
Before purchasing a vehicle or any other good or service you have read about on the AutoTrader Sites, you should confirm with the seller any information, including the price, that is important to your purchasing decision.
AutoTrader.com is not responsible for, and does not guarantee the performance of, any such vehicles, goods or services listed or researched on the AutoTrader Sites.</li>
<li>We may screen some email messages sent through the AutoTrader Sites to sellers about vehicles listed on the AutoTrader Sites.
If it appears that your email message has not reached the seller of the vehicle you are inquiring about, you might try inquiring by telephone if the seller has provided a telephone number.</li>
<li>Our used car listings include vehicles that have been "certified" as meeting certain standards established by manufacturers and/or dealers in connection with their pre-owned vehicle programs.
The decision to certify any particular vehicle is made by the certifying manufacturer or dealer, and the vehicle information included in the AutoTrader Sites' certified vehicle listing is provided by the listing dealer.
Neither AutoTrader.com nor the manufacturer is responsible for the accuracy of any information contained in a certified vehicle listing.
Only the party that certifies a vehicle is responsible for the decision to certify that vehicle.
You should familiarize yourself with the terms of the applicable certification program before buying a certified vehicle.
Ads purchased by private sellers through our Sell Your Car service will not appear in any "certified" area of the AutoTrader Sites.
Ads for certified vehicles apply only to vehicles certified by dealers in accordance with the certification programs of the automobile manufacturers with which we have partnerships.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Listing Your Vehicle <ol>
<li>The AutoTrader Sites offers a variety of ad packages to private sellers, with combinations of features that may vary by market area.
For information about the ad packages available to private sellers in your area, click the "Sell Your Car" tab or button on our home page.
On the next page, enter your ZIP code to view our product offerings.
For information about ad packages available to dealers (and private sellers wishing to list more than five vehicles for sale at a given time), please visit weworkforyou.com.</li>
<li>In order for you to offer a vehicle for sale through our Sell Your Car service for private sellers, you must agree to our Terms of Sale.
The Terms of Sale require, among other things, that you be prepared to sell your vehicle at the price at which, and on the terms on which, you have listed it.
You must have possession of the actual vehicle listed and the ability to transfer title.
To list a vehicle for sale on the AutoTrader Sites, sellers also are required to provide certain identifying and contact information.
The information must accurately identify the seller and the method of contact must permit buyers to communicate directly with the seller.
You may not charge any potential buyer for information about any vehicle listed for sale on the AutoTrader Sites, nor may you use the AutoTrader Sites to promote, without our prior written permission, any other website, product, or service.</li>
<li>By using the AutoTrader Sites to sell your vehicle as a private seller, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, that you are not a motor vehicle dealer, that you are not listing a vehicle for sale in your capacity as an owner, employee or representative of a dealer, and that neither you nor anyone acting on your behalf will list more than five vehicles for sale simultaneously.
A private seller who wishes to list more than five vehicles simultaneously, and any commercial dealer wishing to list any vehicle, must make arrangements with us before doing so.
Please visit weworkforyou.com for information.</li>
<li>When you list a vehicle for sale through our Sell Your Car service, we may obtain additional distribution for your listing through our relationships with other websites, including KBB.com, Univision, MSN Autos, MSN Latino, and NADA Guides.
We also may promote your listing on or through third-party websites or services.
Neither AutoTrader.com nor any website through which we distribute or promote your listing will charge you any additional fee for this additional exposure.
It is simply added value from AutoTrader.com.
Our promotional partners will not contact you with offers to sell you additional distribution or add-on advertising services for your listing without your permission.
If third parties contact you without your permission offering to sell you such services, they have likely misused the AutoTrader Sites and violated this Visitor Agreement to exploit your listing information.
If you receive any such solicitations that you did not authorize, please bring them to our attention by using our contact us form.</li>
<li>Listings are not to be used to advertise more than one vehicle, regardless of a listing's duration.
For this reason, you cannot edit your vehicle's year, make, model, or VIN once you have purchased a listing.
Always double-check this information before purchasing a listing.
Listing fees are generally not refundable, so if you enter incorrect information in the year, make, model, or VIN fields, you will have to delete the listing and purchase a new one to create an accurate listing.
By using the AutoTrader Sites to sell your vehicle, you agree to pay the price of the package you select and the prices of any advertising upgrades, regardless of whether your vehicle sells as a result of the listing.
You also agree to pay any applicable taxes relating to your use of the Sell Your Car service.
Click here for our Refund Policy.</li>
<li>Responsibility for the information contained in each listing lies with each seller.
You alone are responsible for the material you post, including listing information and photos of your vehicle, and for the content of all email messages you transmit through the AutoTrader Sites.
Nothing will undermine a user's confidence in the vehicle you are looking to sell faster than inaccurate statements or misleading representations about the vehicle.
And since any erosion of user confidence in you is likely to be accompanied by erosion of user confidence in us, we care deeply about making sure that the information you supply is accurate and that, in all respects, you treat other users of the AutoTrader Sites fairly and honorably.</li>
<li>In connection with our efforts to combat Internet fraud, some listings may be screened before being posted publicly.
This process may delay the publication of your listing.
Though we cannot monitor every transaction that originates through a listing on the AutoTrader Sites, we may, from time to time, perform random quality assurance tests to confirm that those who offer vehicles for sale over the AutoTrader Sites are prepared to sell those vehicles at the prices and on the terms which such vehicles are advertised.
By using the AutoTrader Sites, you agree to cooperate in these quality assurance tests.
If our tests reveal, or we otherwise learn, that a seller may be violating the terms of this Visitor Agreement, we reserve the right to deny that seller use of services offered on the AutoTrader Sites and any affiliated websites and remove that seller's listings from each site.</li>
<li>By listing a vehicle for sale on the AutoTrader Sites, you agree to use the email addresses of those responding to your listing only to communicate with them about the potential sale of that vehicle.</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Trade-In Marketplace Service <ol>
<li>In addition to the other terms to redeem an Instant Cash Offer that you have received through the Trade-In Marketplace service ("Trade-In Program"): (1) your vehicle must be located in a market in which the Trade-In Program is offered.
(2) you must be the registered owner of the vehicle in question.
(3) you must possess a valid driver's license or other form of valid government-issued photo ID.
(4) you must not be an automobile dealer or an employee or agent of an automobile dealer.
(5) the personal contact information and the information about your vehicle that you provide in response to our online questionnaire must be accurate, complete, and truthful.
and (6) you must deliver your vehicle, with a valid registration and either clear and unencumbered title in your name, or complete documentation regarding any lease obligations or liens on your vehicle (including, for example, contact information for your lender or leasing company, relevant account information, and the current loan payoff amount or lease early termination fee for your vehicle) within 72 hours of the issuance of your Instant Cash Offer ("Offer") to a participating dealer in our network (a "Participating Dealer").
The Participating Dealer will inspect your vehicle to confirm its condition and accuracy of the other information that you submitted about your vehicle online.
Based on the results of this confirmation inspection (more information below) reported by the Participating Dealer, the dollar amount of your Offer may be adjusted up or down prior to redemption.</li>
<li>The Trade-In Program is not available in all areas and not all vehicles are eligible for Offers.
The Trade-In Program may not be used to sell or to trade in current model year (or newer) vehicles, commercial vehicles, vehicles with a police, fire, livery or taxi history, reconstructed or salvage vehicles, vehicles without a valid Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), vehicles not originally built for the United States market or that were imported illegally or outside of official manufacturer channels (i.e., "gray market" vehicles), vehicles older than 17 model years, vehicles with altered drivelines or bodies or illegal or non-functioning emissions equipment, vehicles registered at an auto auction or offered for sale on a wholesale website within 45 days, and vehicles that we would value at less than $1,000.
You may use the Trade-In Program to sell or trade in a maximum of three vehicles in any six-month period.
Vehicles with an Offer value greater than $75,000 may not be accepted by every Participating Dealer and may require an additional inspection.</li>
<li>Although the majority of Offers generated by the Trade-In Program will be delivered within moments of submitting a valid request, some requests require manual review.
This manual review process usually will be completed within minutes of submitting a request but occasionally may take until the next business day.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that if you provide us with any false, incomplete or inaccurate information, including, without limitation, vehicle information or personal contact information, your Offer will be immediately invalidated.
By requesting an Offer, you agree that we, our service providers, and Participating Dealers via any method per the contact information that you supplied, may contact you about vehicles or other products and services that may be of interest to you.
By supplying a mobile number, you consent to receive calls or texts at that number, whether manually or automatically dialed, from us and from Participating Dealers.
You do not have to provide us with a mobile number as a condition of obtaining an Offer.</li>
<li> Participating Dealers <ol>
<li>Participating Dealers pay us a monthly subscription to participate in the Trade-in Marketplace and to receive leads through the Trade-In Program.
Offers provided through the Trade-In Program are calculated and generated by an appraisal process that allows AutoTrader.com to assure Participating Dealers that your vehicle will be worth at least the amount of the Offer.
Participating Dealers are not owned or operated by AutoTrader.com, and are not affiliated with or acting on behalf of AutoTrader.com.
If you redeem your Offer at a Participating Dealer, you will have the option of either using your Offer to trade in your vehicle or to sell your car for a check.
If your Offer does not identify a Participating Dealer near you, please call our Trade-in Marketplace customer service department at 1-866-545-4059 or send us an email to request this information.</li>
<li>Although Participating Dealers are not obligated to purchase your vehicle or accept your vehicle for trade for any price other than the amount of your Offer, you are welcome to try to negotiate a more favorable price or trade-in value for your vehicle and, of course, you are always free to sell or trade-in your vehicle outside of the Trade-In Program.
Though we think the Offer allows for a convenient and easy way to sell your vehicle, it may not be the best sale price or trade-in value that you could receive for your vehicle outside of the Trade-In Program.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Confirmation Inspections <ol>
<li>Participating Dealers will conduct a mandatory vehicle inspection free of charge to confirm the accuracy of the vehicle description and condition information that you provided to us online.
This confirmation inspection may include, for example, paint thickness measurements, a road test, a mechanical inspection, and a review of vehicle history reports and disclosure statements regarding flood, salvage, or odometer discrepancies (including rollbacks), and the like.
The Participating Dealer will submit the results of the confirmation inspection to the Trade-In Program using the same online service that you used to request your Offer, and we may raise or lower the dollar amount of your Offer prior to redemption based on the information revealed by the inspection.
All decisions of the Participating Dealer regarding the condition of your vehicle will be final.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of your vehicle confirmation inspection, you can redeem your Offer, subject to any applicable post-inspection adjustments, by delivering your vehicle on the spot or by returning your vehicle to your Participating Dealer's location by the end of the next business day in the same condition and with no more than 50 additional miles on the odometer.
If you decide to redeem your Offer by selling your vehicle, the Participating Dealer will issue you a check following the release of any applicable liens and lease obligations and the Participating Dealer's receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title.
All checks will be made payable to the vehicle owner(s) named on the vehicle title.
If you elect to redeem your Offer by trading in your vehicle, your Participating Dealer will issue you a trade-in credit against the sale price of any vehicle available in its inventory following the release of all applicable liens and lease obligations and the receipt of a clear and unencumbered vehicle title.
If you have negative equity in your vehicle (i.e., your outstanding loan balance or lease payment obligation exceeds the amount of your Offer), you will be responsible for paying the difference between the Offer and the amount needed to clear the title to your vehicle by certified check or other form of payment acceptable to the Participating Dealer before your transaction can be completed.
If you have positive equity in your vehicle, the Participating Dealer will issue you a check or a trade-in credit, as applicable, for the difference between the amount needed to clear the title to your vehicle and the Offer.
Your Participating Dealer will assist you with the processing of the paperwork and payments necessary to settle your loan or lease obligations and to obtain a clear title to your vehicle.
This process typically takes 10 to 14 business days following delivery of a vehicle to a Participating Dealer, but it could take longer in some circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>BY REDEEMING AN OFFER, YOU AGREE NOT TO SUE AUTOTRADER.COM, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "RELEASED PARTIES") FOR, AND AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RELEASED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY VEHICLE SALE OR TRADE-IN TRANSACTION THAT YOU ENTER INTO WITH A PARTICIPATING DEALER.
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ARISE OUT OF SUCH A TRANSACTION, YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO YOUR PARTICIPATING DEALER FOR YOUR REMEDY AND NOT TO THE RELEASED PARTIES.</li>

<li> Third-Party Services <ol>
<li>For your convenience, we make available a variety of links to other websites that we do not operate where you can obtain automotive-related products and services, including insurance, warranties, financing, and inspection services.</li>
<li>If you choose to purchase an inspection through a third-party website for a vehicle that you are interested in buying, remember that an inspection is not a warranty.
Although inspections can be of significant value in the purchase of a pre-owned vehicle, an inspection is not a guarantee that the inspected vehicle is free from defects or that the inspectors have identified all existing defects.
Before you purchase inspection services, you should confirm with the inspector the location at which the inspection will be conducted.
You are responsible for coordinating and arranging the inspection.
You release AutoTrader.com and its affiliates from any damages that you may incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your purchase or use of third-party supplied products and services.</li>

We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage incurred as the result of such dealings with or the presence of such third parties on the AutoTrader Sites.</li>
<li>For your convenience, we make available links to websites operated by dealers that list their vehicles on the AutoTrader Sites.
Although we or our affiliates may power some of these dealer websites, we are not responsible for any of the content that appears on these websites, including, without limitation, promotional contests and sweepstakes offers.
We do not co-sponsor, operate, endorse, or guarantee any advertiser sweepstakes or contest offer that may be promoted from time to time on the AutoTrader Sites, or that may be accessible through a link from the AutoTrader Sites, and you release AutoTrader.com and our affiliates from any damages that you may incur, and agree not to assert any claims against any of them, arising from your entry, participation, or acceptance of any prize in any such sweepstakes or contest offer.</li>

<li> DISPUTE RESOLUTION  MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER <ol>
<li>
<strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong> YOU AND AUTOTRADER.COM AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES (Claims) THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THE TERMS OF THE VISITOR AGREEMENT, THE AUTOTRADER SITES, OR ANY SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BILLING DISPUTES) SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF LITIGATION IN COURT.
In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury.
Instead, Claims are decided by an arbitrator whose authority is created by and governed by this arbitration agreement.
Review of arbitration awards in the courts is very limited.</li>
<li>
<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</strong> YOU AND AUTOTRADER.COM AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
WE BOTH AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE NO CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS IN ARBITRATION.
In addition, neither you nor AutoTrader.com may participate in a class or representative action in court as a class member if the claims asserted in the arbitration would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if asserted directly by you or AutoTrader.com.
To be clear, you and AutoTrader.com both waive any right to participate in any class action involving disputes between us.<br> This class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and may not be severed.
If for any reason this class action waiver is found unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement will not apply.
However, the Jury Trial Waiver set forth in Section X of the Visitor Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li>
<strong>ARBITRATOR AUTHORITY:</strong> The arbitrators authority is governed by this arbitration agreement.
You and AutoTrader.com agree that the arbitrator may award the same relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award  consistent with and limited by the Visitor Agreement (including the limitations of liability set forth in Section XI), but the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief that extends beyond you and your dealings with AutoTrader.com.
An arbitrator may award attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party if a court would be authorized to do so under the applicable law.</li>
<li>
<strong>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:</strong> You and AutoTrader.com agree that your agreement affects interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA).
The AAAs rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If the Claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAAs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
If the claim is for more than $75,000, then the Commercial Rules will apply.
If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and this arbitration agreement, then this arbitration agreement shall control.
For claims less than $75,000, AutoTrader.com will pay all filing fees and costs associated with commencing an arbitration, but you will be responsible for paying your own attorneys fees (if you chose to use an attorney in arbitration) unless you prevail in the arbitration and the arbitrator finds that you are entitled to recover your fees under the law.
The arbitration will be held in a mutually agreeable and convenient location.</li>
<li>
<strong>SURVIVAL:</strong> This arbitration agreement survives the termination of this Visitor Agreement between you and AutoTrader.com.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
You and AutoTrader.com expressly and knowingly <strong>WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</strong> This means that if for any reason the arbitration agreement contained in Section IX is not enforced or is found inapplicable, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.
