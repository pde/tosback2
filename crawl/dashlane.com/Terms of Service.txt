<em>License</em>.
Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement, Dashlane grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to install and use the App on a single computer, solely in object code format.
This license does not entitle you to receive from Dashlane hard-copy documentation, support, telephone assistance, or enhancements or updates to the App, though we may provide any of the foregoing in our sole discretion.
You may install the App on multiple devices (and we encourage you to do so), but each installation is governed by its own license.
In addition to the other restrictions set forth herein, You may not incorporate, integrate or otherwise include the App or any portion thereof into any other software, program or product.
</li>
<li>
<em>Usage</em>.
Now that you have the App, you will input the data you wish for the App to store, including your addresses, payment information and other personal information ("<strong>Stored Data</strong>").
You may select which category of this Stored Data (except for financial account information such as credit card numbers) ("<strong>Selected Data</strong>") is to be synchronized with our servers through the Services in accordance with our documentation.
You may add any number of devices to your Account.
Once you have these other devices linked to your Account, you can use your Selected Data on those devices as well.
You agree and understand that this synchronization function is meant for your personal or internal business use only.
You are responsible for all activities occurring with any versions of the App you install.

</li>
<li>
<em>Stored Data</em>.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Stored Data.
The App is designed to encrypt the Stored Data on your personal computer using AES-256 encryption, but encryption alone does not guarantee the security of the Stored Data.
You are responsible for preventing unauthorized third parties from accessing that device and, if you use the Services as well, following the requirements in Dashlane’s Terms of Service.
Dashlane cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the Stored Data that is inputted onto a web page by the App.
As the App processes are automatic, Dashlane does not screen the Stored Data when provided through the App.
<strong>You should confirm the accuracy of the Stored Data that is inputted onto a web page by the App each and every time you use the App.</strong> The App operates in third-party web browsers, and Dashlane has no responsibility for any such browser.

When installed, the App may, from time to time, automatically report back information to Dashlane’s servers related to installation, updates, usage and errors arising in connection with your use of the App, without notice to you.
These reports do not personally identify you.
The primary use of this data is to help diagnose and resolve technical and performance issues in relation to the App’s compatibility with the latest operating systems.
The App may also provide Dashlane with anonymous information about use of the App’s features.
Dashlane uses this information in the aggregate to determine which App features are most popular and useful to its users, and to validate the continued existence and usage of an installed App.
The App may also provide Dashlane with anonymous information about transactions and web actions completed using the App, for statistical and marketing purposes.
The App may contain a specific identification number for the purpose of tracking the number of unique instances of the App in use.
All of the data processed by Dashlane in accordance with this paragraph is <strong>strictly anonymous</strong> and cannot serve to identify you.

(b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and Dashlane, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
(c) the arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory.
(d) any claims brought by you or dashlane must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
(e) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, (f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Dashlane will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (g) Dashlane also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.
(h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.
(i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Dashlane shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Dashlane customer.
and (j) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses.
</li>
<li> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dashlane may bring an individual action in small claims court.
In addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in our privacy policy (if any), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.
Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision.
Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in Wilmington, Delaware.
Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
</li>
<li> With the exception of subparts (d) and (e) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither You nor Dashlane shall be entitled to arbitration.
In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Dashlane shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts specified in subsection "(d)" above.
