</p> For the purposes of this Agreement: <p>
<br>"Digital Content" means digitized electronic content, such as books, newspapers, magazines, journals, music, videos, apps, blogs, RSS feeds, games, and other static and interactive electronic content.</p>
<p>
<br>"Kindle" means our portable electronic reading devices.</p>
<p>
<br>"Reading Application" means software (including any updates/upgrades to that software) we make available that permits users to shop for, download, browse, and/or use Digital Content on a Supported Device.</p>
<p>
<br>"Service" means the wireless connectivity that we provide Kindle users, the provision of Digital Content, Software, and support and other services that we provide Kindle and Reading Application users.</p>
<p>
<br>"Software" means the Reading Applications and all software on the Kindle (including any updates/upgrades to that software), and any related documentation that we make available to you.</p>

<p>
</p> 1.
<strong>Wireless Connectivity</strong>
<p>
<strong>Use of Wireless Connectivity.</strong> Your Kindle uses wireless connectivity to allow you to shop for and download Digital Content.
Some Kindle devices may require you to purchase a data plan from a third party in order to receive and use wireless connectivity.
In such case, your wireless connectivity is subject to the fees, restrictions and limitations imposed by the wireless provider.
In addition, if your Kindle functions with third party services, such as Wi-Fi access points, a third party may charge you fees for the use of those services.
If your Kindle is not subject to a data plan or other third party fees, generally, we do not charge you for use of wireless connectivity.
</p>
<p>However, your Kindle may use wireless connectivity to make other services available to you for which we may charge you a fee, such as personal file download and subscriptions when you are located in another country.
The fees and terms for such services are located on the Amazon.com website or on or through your Kindle and may change from time to time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Conduct.</strong> You may use the wireless connectivity provided by us only in connection with the Service as permitted by this Agreement.
You may not use the wireless connectivity for any other purpose.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Availability.
</strong>If your Kindle is located in an area in which it cannot maintain wireless connectivity, you may not be able to use some or all of the Service.
We are not responsible for the unavailability of wireless connectivity for your Kindle or any corresponding loss of Service.
Events beyond our reasonable control (such as changes in service or terms by wireless carriers) may impact the terms or circumstances under which we provide you wireless connectivity and may result in a change to these terms or a temporary or permanent modification or loss of wireless connectivity for your Kindle.
</p> 2.
Device and Software <p>
<strong>Use of the Software.</strong> You may use the Software only on a Kindle or through a Reading Application on a Supported Device.
Additional terms contained in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use apply to the Software.
For additional terms that apply to certain third party software, see the Legal, Legal &amp.
Compliance, or similar section in the Settings menu of your Kindle or the Legal Notices section of your Reading Application.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Location Based Services</strong>
<strong>.</strong> Some Kindle devices have a feature that, when enabled, allows Amazon and applications on your device to access location information that can be used to provide location based services.
Learn more about collection and use of location data.
If you are using location based services on your Kindle for navigation, you are solely responsible for ensuring you drive safely, observe all traffic rules, and use your own judgment while driving and selecting routes.
Amazon does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of any location based services.<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>

Information provided to Amazon, including annotations, bookmarks, notes, highlights, or similar markings you make using your Kindle or Reading Application, may be stored on servers that are located outside the country in which you live.
Any information we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice.<br>

<strong>Changes to Service.</strong> We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, at any time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Termination.</strong> Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement.
In case of such termination, Amazon may immediately revoke your access to the Service without refund of any fees.
Amazon's failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights.<strong>
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Governing Language.</strong> If this Agreement is translated into a language other than English, the English version will govern and prevail to the extent that there is any conflict or discrepancy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Disputes/Binding Arbitration.
