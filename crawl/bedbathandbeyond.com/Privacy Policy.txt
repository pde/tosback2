<b>What Information Do We Actively Collect and Inactively Gather? </b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Personal Information</b>
<br> In order to process orders efficiently, when you place an order with us or register an account on the Site we actively collect the following personal information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card number (<b>Personal Information</b>).
If you prefer not to disclose your Personal Information online, you can always place your order by calling 1-800-GO BEYOND® (1-800-462-3966) or visiting one of our many stores.
You may need to visit a separate site to find locations for the Brands.<br>
<br> We may periodically conduct surveys of visitors to our Site for internal research purposes that may include marketing.
This helps us better understand what our customers would like to see from us.
If you respond to such surveys, we may ask you for some Personal Information and/or may contact you for more information, but only if you have given us permission to do so.<br>
<br> We may also receive information about you from other sources.
<br>
<br>
<b>Site Usage Information</b>
<br> We (including through our third party service providers) may inactively collect from you information that is not in the same category as Personal Information.
For example, we might track information about the date and time you access the Site, the type of web browser you used, and the web site from which you connect to our Site.
We collect and use this and other non-Personal Information (such as demographic data) to analyze and develop our business strategy and to determine how you found out about us, your interests regarding our products and services and how to further improve our Site.
We, or a third party, may also collect information from your activities on the Site as well as other sites for the purpose of providing advertisements and other content that is customized to your interests and preferences.
This means that our ads may appear on participating web sites based upon your browsing activity.
To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do many web sites, use and allow our third party advertising companies to use the technologies listed below and other similar technologies (the <b>Tracking Technologies</b>): <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cookies and Clear GIFs</b> - Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computers hard drive.
Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information (i.e., username, password, shopping cart information, etc.) while youre at a site.
Cookies also track where you travel on a site and what you look at and purchase.
A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individuals viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
You can learn more about how third party advertising companies use cookies and clear GIFs, including how to opt-out, by clicking here.
Please read the explanation carefully should you choose to opt-out using this method.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>IP Address Tracking and Clickstream Data </b> - In addition to cookies and clear GIFs, our servers automatically collect data about your servers Internet address when you visit our Site.
This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or <b>IP Address</b>, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet.
When you view pages from our Site, our servers may record or log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.
Our server also may record the page that linked you to us and related information including any ads you may have clicked on.
Such information is known as <b>Clickstream Data</b>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Email Interconnectivity </b> - If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools to capture data related to when you open our message, click on any links or banners it contains and make purchases.
</li>
</ul> In some cases, we may link the non-Personal information collected through the Tracking Technologies with certain of your Personal Information.
WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ACCEPTING TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER IN NO WAY GIVES US ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.
YOU MAY SET YOUR WEB BROWSER SOFTWARE TO REJECT TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES, BUT, IF YOU DO SO, CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITE MAY BE AFFECTED.
Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers and fulfillment companies) may also use Tracking Technologies by or through the Site.
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT INFORMATION SUCH THIRD PARTIES TRACK OR COLLECT, AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.<br>
<br>
<b>Mobile Device Identifiers</b> You may be visiting the Site from your mobile device.
Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such information if you access the Site through mobile devices.
Some features of the Site may allow for the collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information.
Furthermore, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service.

<b>Special Note Regarding our Investor Relations Web Pages</b>
<br> WE COMPLY WITH U.S.
FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS WITH REGARD TO THOSE PAGES OF OUR SITE USED TO FURNISH INVESTOR RELATIONS MATERIALS SUCH AS ELECTRONIC PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL REPORTS (THE <b>INVESTOR RELATIONS PAGES</b>).
WE DO NOT PLACE COOKIES OR CLEAR GIFS ON THE HARD DRIVES OF USERS VISITING THE INVESTOR RELATIONS PAGES.<br>
<br>
<b>Security of the Information You Provide</b>
<br> Among our top priorities is keeping your Personal Information secure.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all of your Personal Information before it is transmitted to us so that it can be safeguarded as much as possible from being read or recorded as it travels over the Internet.
You can tell you are sending information securely by the unbroken key icon or closed lock icon that appears at the bottom of your Internet browser's window.
These icons will appear when you are placing an order on our Site.
In addition, you will see our Site address change slightly, from http: to https: indicating a secure server connection is being used.
The computers that store your Personal Information are located in a separate facility which employs firewall and security technology.
We employ these procedures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.<br>
<br> You may be able to create an account on our Site with a username and password, including if you set up a wish list, customer account, a registry, or use the Bridal Toolkit.
We recommend you exercise extreme care in protecting your password information and do not publicly share any of your passwords.
You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the Site by you or another person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you.<br>
<br> Your Personal Information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States.
The laws on holding Personal Information in the United States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold and transmit your Personal Information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.
If you object to your Personal Information being transferred or used in this manner please do not register with or use the Site.<br>
<br> ALTHOUGH WE WILL TAKE (AND REQUIRE OUR THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS TO TAKE) REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM AND STORED ON THE SITE, BECAUSE OF THE OPEN NATURE OF THE INTERNET, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED ON OUR SERVERS, TRANSMITTED TO OR FROM A USER, OR OTHERWISE IN OUR CARE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY SAFE FROM INTRUSION BY OTHERS, SUCH AS HACKERS.
ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY THEFT OR LOSS OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, OR INTERCEPTION OF ANY DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS.
BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ASSUME THESE RISKS.<br>
<br>
<b>How Do We Use the Information that You Provide and We Collect?</b>
<br> We collect Personal Information for the purposes of fulfilling orders, processing returns and exchanges and providing you with the services you have chosen, providing a high level of customer service, providing you with information we believe may be of interest including mailing our circulars and special offers, for editorial and feedback purposes, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of your behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for protection against fraud and error, and to customize the content and layout of the Site (collectively, <b>Information Usage Purposes</b>).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not knowingly use a mobile phone number for marketing purposes without first obtaining your consent.
In performing the Information Usage Purposes, we may combine information we collect on the Site with information we receive from other sources.
We do not sell Personal Information and we do not disclose Personal Information to any other party, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, any non-Personal Information you transmit to the Site or we collect from the Site will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and you agree that we may use any such non-Personal Information (together with any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained therein) in any manner, for any purpose, without credit or compensation to you.
Without limiting the generality or application of the foregoing, the information that you publish on or through the Bridal &amp.
Gift Registry and/or the Bridal Toolkit® is governed by specific terms available below under the heading Bridal &amp.
Gift Registry Information.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing of Your Information With Our Partners.
Transfer of Your Information </b>
<br> We may provide your Personal Information to our associates and to companies acting as our authorized agents or partners in providing our service or co-branded services to you and in performing Information Usage Purposes.
We screen and reasonably determine to be reputable any third party to whom we disclose such information and we require such third parties to agree to use the Personal Information only for such specified purposes.
Each of our partners must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your Personal Information in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.<br>
<br> If we merge, or sell or otherwise transfer our assets, Site or operations, we may disclose or transfer your Personal Information in connection with such transaction.<br>
<br>
<b>Bridal &amp.
Gift Registry Information</b>
<br> Bridal &amp.
Gift Registry information is treated differently from information submitted for other purposes on our Site.
Registry users may receive additional e-mail communications from us, such as a registry welcome e-mail and follow-up contact after the scheduled event date.
In addition, cookies are used as part of our registry service to save your registry number on your computer.
By registering with us and opting to make your registry available online, your registry information, which includes your name, date of event and event location (your state), will be made available to our partners that help provide our services and our co-branded services (including for Information Usage Purposes) and will be accessible by search engines and spiders that are not affiliated with us.<br>
<br> Finally, and to illustrate the type of business partner with whom your registry information may be shared, if you have not taken advantage of the applicable opt-out procedure, your registry information (your name, date of event and event location) may be made available to third party bridal and gift registry portal sites.
We may also share the e-mail address associated with your registry, but solely to enable us and such a third-party registry portal site to link your purchases or other activity with the registry you have established with us.
The use of such portal sites is intended to provide your guests with additional means of finding your registry, and to provide you with additional ways to create a registry with us.
Any third-party registry portal site with whom an e-mail address is shared as a registry identifier is contractually prohibited from using it for any other purpose not outlined above.
In the future, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing your information with such sites, please send an e-mail to customer.service@bedbath.com clearly indicating such request.<br>
<br> If you choose to use our online Bridal Toolkit and publish a Personal Wedding Site, this information will be treated as public information, available to anyone with access to the Internet.
Please review the Sites Terms and Conditions for more information on the use of the Bridal &amp.
Gift Registry and the Bridal Toolkit.<br>
<br>
<b>Use of Information in Sweepstakes and Contests.</b>
<br> Occasionally, we may run a promotion such as a sweepstakes or a contest (a Promotion), and you will be given the opportunity to enter by filling out an entry form, or in some cases, you may be automatically entered by using a designated type of credit card when placing an order in store, online or via phone or, for example, by creating a Bridal Registry.
Your entry information may be shared with third parties for the limited purposes of administering the sweepstakes and selecting a winner(s) and may be used to notify you in connection with the sweepstakes or contest and to verify your identity.
When you enter such a Promotion, you will have the opportunity to consent to receive future communications from us.
Since we value your privacy, you will always have the opportunity to stop such communications as detailed below.
In addition, some Promotions may have one or more co-sponsors, and you may also be asked upon entry to consent to receive future communications from such co-sponsors.
In the event your consent is indicated, the information from your entry will be shared with the co-sponsors.
In those situations, the third parties will have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies, and we are not responsible for how co-sponsors may use your information.
In all events, we will make it clear to you in the entry, order or registration form, before you submit it, whether you are consenting to receive information from any party, and you will be given the opportunity to confirm or withdraw such consent prior to submitting your entry, order or registration.
<br>
<br> In any case, where you elect to have us share your information with third parties, such as in the Promotions discussed above, those elections to have your information shared will supersede anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
<b>How to Opt-out</b>
<br> We will only send e-mail for customer service purposes and to those customers who have indicated that they wish to receive other types of e-mail from us and our subsidiaries.
<br>
<br> If at any time you wish to stop receiving e-mail from us, you can always remove your name from our mailing list by sending an e-mail to customer.service@bedbath.com stating that you wish to unsubscribe and indicating in the subject line of the e-mail "NO E-MAIL".
Although we will promptly remove your name from our e-mail list upon receiving your request, it is possible that you may still receive e-mails from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed from our list.<br>
<br> If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us, you can always remove yourself from our mailing list by sending an e-mail to customer.service@bedbath.com, indicating "NO SNAIL MAIL" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code.
Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent.
