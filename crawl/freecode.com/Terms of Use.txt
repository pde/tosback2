Slashdot Media reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse or delete any Content at any time.

With respect to Content posted to private areas of Sourceforge.net (e.g., private development tools or mail), the submitting user may grant to SlashDot Media or other Sourceforge.net users such rights and licenses as the submitting Sourceforge.net user deems appropriate.
Content located on any Slashdot Media-hosted subdomain which is subject to the sole editorial control of the owner or licensee of such subdomain, shall be subject to the appropriate license applicable to such Content, or to such other licensing arrangements as may be approved by Slashdot Media as applicable to such Content.

DMCA Counter-Notification Procedure: After receiving a notification of alleged infringement, Slashdot Media will remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.
At the same time, Slashdot Media will provide the project administrator(s) of the affected project or the provider of affected material with a copy of the notice.
The administrator of an affected project or the provider of affected material may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Please be advised that you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations pursuant to federal law in the counter notification.
When we receive a counter notification, we may reinstate the material in question.
To file a counter notification with us, the administrator of an affected site or the provider of affected material must provide a written communication (by postal mail, overnight mail, or, when digitally-signed, by email) that sets forth the items specified below.
(A sample counter notification may be found at www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf.) To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):
<blockquote>a.
Identify the material that Slashdot Media has removed or to which Slashdot Media has disabled access and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.<br> b.
Provide your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in San Diego, California (if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Slashdot Media may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the initial notification of infringement or an agent of such person.<br> c.
Include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the removed material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”<br> d.
Sign the paper or affix an electronic or digital signature to the communication in a form reasonably acceptable to Slashdot Media.<br> e.
Send written communication to the following address:<br>

Upon receipt of a counter notification in substantial compliance with the DMCA, Slashdot Media will provide the person who provided the initial notification of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification promptly.
After receipt of the counter notification, Slashdot Media will generally replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it, unless Slashdot Media’s designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order regarding the removed material.</blockquote>
<p>Slashdot Media is generally unable to evaluate the merits of trademark disputes because trademark rights may be based on registration or common law use, exist only for certain categories of goods or services and may differ internationally.
Therefore, Slashdot Media expects you to resolve trademark disputes directly with the project administrator(s) rather than utilizing Slashdot Media as an intermediary.</p>
