<p>A cookie is a small data bit that resides on your browser that may contain non-personal information (such as unique user ID) that can be used to track the pages you visit while on a site.
We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience.
In order for our web server to produce some of our advanced site features, such as signing in, or creating a shopping cart, we need to assign you cookies.
In fact, without cookies, our web server would forget who you are every time you move to another page on our web site.
The cookie tells the web server which cart you are using.
To accomplish this, the cookie is a "session cookie" (also called "transient cookie"), which means that it will be erased when you close your web browser.</p>
<p>On most Internet Browsers, the cookie function can be turned off, but by doing so, you will be unable to shop at many internet sites, including josbank.com.
