3.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER
<p>3.1    You and NETGEAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to NETGEAR’s Terms and Conditions, Products, and relationship with You, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or efficacy of the NETGEAR Products.
All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator.
This agreement includes any claims against NETGEAR’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of NETGEAR.
Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.
<br>
<br>
3.2    To the extent possible under Your local law, the arbitration will take place in Santa Clara County, California.
The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.
NETGEAR’s Products and relationship with You involve interstate commerce, and this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§§ 1 <em>et seq.</em>).
<br>
<br>
<strong>3.3    CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND NETGEAR AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</strong>
<br>
<br>
3.4    Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action.
This arbitration agreement does not stop You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on Your behalf.
If this specific provision, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” is found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
<br>
<br>
3.5    Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You agree that if NETGEAR makes any future, material change to this arbitration provision, You may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to <strong>legal@netgear.com</strong>.
Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which You have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.
<br>
<br>
3.6    This arbitration provision is optional.
You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to <strong>legal@netgear.com</strong> within thirty (30) calendar days of purchasing Your NETGEAR Product.
<br>
<br>
3.7    Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
