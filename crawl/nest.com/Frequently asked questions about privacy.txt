<p>What kind of data does Nest collect?</p>
<p>Nest collects the data we believe is necessary to provide a great experience with your Nest products and services – to help you save energy, to help you stay safe, and to keep you in touch with your home.
You can read more about the data that different Nest products collect in our Privacy Statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Nest use data?</p>
<p>We use data to offer and provide our products and services, and make them more thoughtful and responsive to you.
For example, your Nest Thermostat uses sensors to collect data such as temperature and humidity in the room.
This helps your thermostat keep you comfortable when you are at home, save energy when you are away, or adjust for sunlight warming your house.

<p>How does Nest use my Home and Away information?</p>
<p>If you choose to enable Home/Away Assist, we’ll use inputs from your product sensors and mobile phone to help determine if you’re home or away so that your products can work even better.
You have full control over how your Nest products respond to your Home and Away settings.

<p>How does Nest keep my data secure?</p>
