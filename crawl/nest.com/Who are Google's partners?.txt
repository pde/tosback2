Who are Google’s partners?<p>Google works with businesses and organizations in a variety of ways.
We refer to these businesses and organizations as “partners”.
For example, over 2 million non-Google websites and apps partner with Google to show ads.
Millions of developer partners publish their apps on Google Play.
Other partners help Google with securing our services.
information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p>
<p>Note we also work with trusted businesses as “data processors” rather than partners, meaning they process information on our behalf, to support our services, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
The Google Privacy Policy has more information about how we use data processors.</p>Information collected or received by Google’s advertising partners<p>Specific partners, listed below, can collect or receive non-personally identifiable information about your browser or device when you use Google sites and apps.
These partners collect this information for advertising and ad measurement purposes, using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<p>For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<p>You can learn more about how these specific partners collect and use your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nielsen</li>
<li>comScore</li>
<li>Integral Ad Science</li>
<li>DoubleVerify</li>
<li>Oracle Data Cloud</li>
<li>Kantar</li>
<li>RN SSI Group</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube also allows advertisers and creators to serve advertisements directly, using their own ad serving technologies, outside of EEA countries.</p>
<p>Another example is merchants on our shopping pages who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with our advertising partners, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to share it.
For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</p>
<p>You can read more about the information Google collects, including from partners, in the Privacy Policy.</p>
