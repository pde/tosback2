COLOR PRIVACY POLICY <p>
<em>WHO WE ARE</em> We are Color Labs, Inc., doing business as Color.
We work at 201 Hamilton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301.
We created an app for your smart phone, tablet computer or anything else that allows our app to function (your “Device”) and we have created a Facebook app – our app links with our Facebook app in order to access and create Facebook content for you.
We also maintain a website on which your images and videos are collectively displayed.
We collectively call the apps “App” and the website “Site.” The action a user takes on our App is directly reflected on Facebook and vice versa.
This is our Privacy Policy and it applies to our App and Site.
If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, please send an email to privacy@color.com.
We last updated this Privacy Policy on December 12th, 2011.
We’ll update you before our practices change.
As we offer more interesting options for you, our policy may change.
Color’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect and how we collect, share, and use the information.
By using or accessing the App and/or Site, you are accepting the practices described here and on Facebook’s privacy policy.
You may only use the App through the Facebook Connect feature, which means you have already agreed to Facebook’s terms and conditions.
Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect information from minors under the age of 13 and our App and Site aren’t intended for minors under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
<em>HERE’S WHAT WE COLLECT WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD AND USE OUR APP</em>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook Token.
We do not collect or store your Facebook login and password.
we store a “token” via the Facebook Connect Platform that we cannot use to decipher your login and password.
</li>
<li>Location Information.
Like most mobile devices, if you allow it by opting in, we also collect your location.
We will not be able to collect location information if you do not opt in.
</li>
<li>Information You Provide to Us.
For instance, when you take a picture, record a video, and/or create an album using the App, we collect the name of the album and the photos, video (including video streams) and all of the data associated with it, including captions in it, tags, comments, and likes (all collectively referred to as “Images”).
</li>
<li>Facebook Information.
We collect information from your Facebook profile and page that you provide in connection with the Facebook Connect process, which may include (but is not limited to) your email address(es), groups, photos, photos shared with you, posts, data, friends, and timeline information, and other information you provide through any and all notification channels, including but not limited to wall posts.
</li>
<li>Device Information.
We collect information to identify your device and its capabilities and information from its sensors </li>
<li>Clickstream Data.
We collect information on how the app is used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Collectively, we call the foregoing data your “Personal Information.” If you choose to use our invitation service to tell friends about our App and Site or invite them to collaborate on public or private albums, your friends will be invited via wall posts on Facebook.
Like most websites we store certain information automatically, which we call “caching.” This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, your Images, and Images you view.
This cached data remains on your phone and you can delete it yourself (we cannot).
whatever cached data we have stored on our system is deleted roughly every 2 days automatically.
</p>
<p>
<em>HERE’S WHO SEES YOUR IMAGES</em> You may take pictures and create albums through the Color App.
When you take a photo through the Color App, you are allowed to designate the album into which the photo will reside, or you can simply use the default album (“Mobile Album”).
Once you take a photo, that photo is immediately posted to your Facebook page, and your friends may view it according to your personal privacy settings on Facebook.
Make sure you check those settings so you know how and where your Images will appear.
Any Images you take, and any pictures your friends have posted on Facebook (regardless of whether they used the Color App), will also be viewable through the Color App.
Color displays, but does not store your friends’ Images.
Color stores only Images taken through the Color App.
Your Images may be seen in other ways using our added features.
Group Albums.
When you create an album using the Color App, you may invite your Facebook friends to contribute to that album (“Group Album”).
You will see your invited friends’ (“Invited Friends”) photographs when you view your Group Album through the App, but currently, you will not see their photographs in your Group Album on your Facebook page Invited Friends’ photographs will only be stored on their own Facebook pages and viewable consistent with their privacy settings.
All the Facebook friends of all the contributors of the Group Album may view all photographs within a Group Album in the Color Environment.
Visiting.
The Color App lets you both post your content to Facebook and stream content live to your friends.
When a Facebook friend views a photograph on their Device or computer, that you posted, and clicks on the VISIT icon, you will be sent a Visit request.
If you accept the Visit request, then you can use your phone as a live-streaming device (we call this “Hosting”), and anyone from whom you accept a Visit request will see what you see and, subject to your personal privacy settings on Facebook, anyone in your Facebook network will be notified that you are Hosting the Visit.
In essence, your camera becomes a mechanism to broadcast what you see live.
Once the Site is running, we will collect non-personally-identifiable information including your browser type, operating system, domain names, and IP Address.
We use different types of technologies to collect this information, including single-pixel GIFs, and cookies.
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.
We use session ID cookies to confirm you are logged in.
