<strong>The best way to avoid getting tricked by scammers is to know the tricks they use – and the red flags that signal scams.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Always remain vigilant as criminals are looking to profit from coronavirus scams.</li>
<li>
<strong>You should not be contacted by anyone regarding the Economic Impact Payment, otherwise known as “stimulus payment”:</strong> Don't respond to phone, mail, email, text or social media requesting verification of personal information, fees, or banking information in order to receive a payment.
For more information including eligibility and any action you need to take, visit www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments. layer</li>
<li>
<strong>Always keep your information private.</strong> If we need to reach out to you, we will never ask for confidential information such as your passcode, personal identification number (PIN) or other account information.
If you receive an unsolicited email, text or call asking for confidential information, ignore it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Beware of offers that are too good to be true.</strong> Scammers may promise to deliver hard-to-find goods or coronavirus-related products or supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>The most common types of scams will target you through fake emails (a technique known as phishing), text messages (SMSishing or smishing) voice calls (vishing), letters or even someone who shows up at your front door unexpectedly.
No matter which technique the scammer uses, you may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructed to not trust Bank of America or to respond to questions in ways that aren’t the truth</li>
<li>Pressured to send money</li>
<li>Threatened with law enforcement action</li>
<li>Told to purchase gift cards and provide codes as a form of payment</li>
<li>Asked to cash a check for a stranger or send money via wire transfer or Zelle<sup>®</sup>
</li>
<li>Asked to deposit a check that overpays for something you're selling, and then send the difference elsewhere</li>
<li>Tempted to buy products online that seem too good to be true or are hard to find</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The best ways to avoid getting scammed</strong>
<br>If you provide your information or send money to a scammer, there is often little we can do to help get your money back.</p>Expand all panelsShow all panels | Hide all panelsDon't send gift cards as payment or buy gift cards for someone you don’t know Don't cash checks for strangers or return funds for overpayment Don't provide account or personal information via email or text Never Trust Caller ID Don't give an unsolicited caller or solicitor your personal information or codes Don't pay upfront for a promise Don't click on unsolicited links or attachments sent via email or text Never give an unsolicited caller remote access to your computer Don't wire money without verifying instructions Don't feel pressured to act immediately Don't send gift cards as payment or buy gift cards for someone you don’t know Expand all panelsWhether masquerading as IRS agents, tech-support personnel or the attorney for the grandchild who’s supposedly in jail, criminals pressure their targets to buy gift cards for iTunes, Google Play, Best Buy and other popular retailers — and ask them to provide the code numbers, or PINs, on the back of the cards so they can be redeemed.
Don't cash checks for strangers or return funds for overpayment Expand all panelsIf someone you don’t know wants to pay you by check and asks you to wire some of the money back or give them cash, beware! It could be a scam that could cost you thousands of dollars.
When making a check deposit, remember that Bank of America may give you immediate access to the funds, but the check can still be returned unpaid.
Don't provide account or personal information via email or text Expand all panelsWe will never email or text you requesting you to call or respond with your account number, PIN or access code.
Never Trust Caller ID Expand all panelsScammers may pose as government officials, law enforcement or even Bank of America employees to steal your personal information.
Always validate a person’s organization by calling them back through an official phone number.
Don't give an unsolicited caller or solicitor your personal information or codes Expand all panelsBank of America will never call you or visit your home asking you to verify your account numbers, password or access code.
If you receive a call, text or email, or someone comes to your home asking for this information, don’t give it out.
Consider installing an app to block robocalls to your phone.
Don't pay upfront for a promise Expand all panelsScammers may ask you to pay in advance for things like debt relief, credit and loan offers, mortgage assistance or a job.
They may say you've won a prize, but first you need to pay taxes or fees.
If you do, they will probably take the money and disappear.
Don't click on unsolicited links or attachments sent via email or text Expand all panelsScammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving them your personal information.
These messages seem identical to official correspondence.
Check it out first by calling a phone number you trust and talk with someone about the notification.
Don't call phone numbers mentioned in the questionable message.
Never give an unsolicited caller remote access to your computer Expand all panelsScammers may pose as an employee of a large telecommunications company or a technical support provider to tell you that your computer is experiencing technical problems.
They will ask for remote access to solve the problem before demanding that you buy software or pay a fee to fix the computer.
Don't wire money without verifying instructions Expand all panelsUse caution when wiring funds to unknown people or businesses.
Scammers posing as a government official, relative, closing agent or some other trusted source often modify wiring instructions to route your money to the wrong account.
Don't feel pressured to act immediately Expand all panelsScammers typically demand immediate responses and payment.
Sometimes they even threaten law enforcement or legal action.
If you feel threatened or are asked not to provide details to others or your bank about the reason for transaction, it could be a scam.
Always ask us for help.<p>Contact us immediately if you feel you may have been a victim of a scam.</p>
