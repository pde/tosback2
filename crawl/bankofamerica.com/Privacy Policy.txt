<strong>The best way to avoid getting tricked by scammers is to know the tricks they use – and the red flags that signal scams.</strong>

</strong>The most common types of scams will target you through fake emails (a technique known as phishing), text messages (SMSishing or smishing) voice calls (vishing), letters or even someone who shows up at your front door unexpectedly.
No matter which technique the scammer uses, you may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressured to send money</li>
<li>Threatened with law enforcement action</li>
<li>Told to purchase gift cards and provide codes as a form of payment</li>
<li>Asked to cash a check for a stranger or send money via wire transfer or <em>Zelle</em>
<sup>®</sup>
</li>
<li>Asked to deposit a check that overpays for something you're selling, and then send the difference elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<br>The best way to avoid getting scammed</strong>
<br> If you provide your information or send money to a scammer, there is often little we can do to help get your money back.</p>
