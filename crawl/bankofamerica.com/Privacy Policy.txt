<li>Only download software or applications from well-known or reputable sources, such as Apple, Google Play or Microsoft.

Scammers count on users being too busy to see differences that can make fake software easier to spot.</li>
<li>Install any operating system and software updates (sometimes called patches or service packs)</li>
<li>Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services when you're not using them, and avoid using public Wi-Fi for financial transactions unless you use a secure, private connection, like VPN software.</li>

<li>If you receive a suspicious call, text or email from someone claiming to be from Bank of America, do not respond, click links or open attachments.
If this has happened to you, contact us right away at 800.432.1000.</li>
<li>If you’re being asked to send money as the result of a call, text or email, here are some questions you need to consider:
<ul>
<li>Is the requestor rushing or pressuring you?</li>
<li>Is the person asking for money someone you’ve never met?</li>
<li>If a business is requesting that you wire money or send funds online, is it to a new account number or different from what was described on initial paperwork?</li>
<li>Is the phone number that’s calling you (from, for example, your title company, contractor or attorney) different than usual?</li>
<li>Are you being pressured to send money to claim lottery funds or some other form of prize?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer yes to any of these, think carefully about the request to send money.
It may be a scam.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you believe you may have been the victim of a scam, report your experience to the FTC and/or to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center.
