<li>If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.</li>
</ul>Additional InformationAggregation Services<p>Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider").
To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.</li>
<li>You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.</li>
<li>Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.</li>
<li>We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.</li>
<li>If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.</li>
<li>If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.</li>
<li>You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.</li>
</ul>Social Media<p>Bank of America engages with customers on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, YouTube® and LinkedIn®.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.</li>
<li>When interacting with official Bank of America social media pages, Bank of America's privacy notices, Social Media User Terms and Community Guidelines may apply.</li>
<li>Please review the privacy policy for the specific social media service you are using to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may allow certain non-affiliated third party widgets (for example social share buttons) on our sites that enable users to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform.

</ul>Additional InformationAggregation Services<p>Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider").
To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.</li>
<li>You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.</li>
<li>Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.</li>
<li>We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.</li>
<li>If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.</li>
<li>If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.</li>
<li>You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.</li>
