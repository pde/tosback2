We use such technical information for internal purposes, for example to study and improve the response times of our Website.
We may associate such technical information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information.
Please be advised that associating technical information with personal information may be required for us, and our Service Providers, to recognize you and your communications with us, for example to retain your newsletter preferences or enable your use of a "shopping cart." </p>
<p>

<p>Location Data.
When you use an MLBAM Property via a wireless device we may solicit your permission to collect your location data.
Some features within our Applications (e.g., live MLB game video or location-based offers) may only function upon confirmation of your location, and therefore such features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us.
The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the Internet (e.g., via cable broadband connection, WiFi).
If you enable location services for our Applications, we may collect location data (e.g., zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Applications.
We use such location information for internal purposes and to improve your MLBAM Property experience, for example to understand where our users are most successfully accessing the MLBAM Properties.
We may associate such location information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information.
Depending on the platform you use to access our Applications (e.g., Apple's iOS, Google's Android) you may be able to control whether location data is collected from within "Settings" or other controls on your wireless device or the Applications.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our Access to Your Contacts.

When using the MLBAM Properties or when using certain third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google +) (each a "Social Network"), you may have the option to connect your MLBAM Property information and activity with your Social Network information and activity.
If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to share or publish information about your MLBAM Property activity with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you consent to the connection.
