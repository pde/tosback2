<p>EMG respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users to do the same.
The Service operates as a user generated content hosting platform, and we strictly abide by the processes set forth in the U.S.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("<u>DMCA</u>").
EMG employs an industry-leading two-strike policy for repeat infringers.
Should EMG receive a DMCA Notice indicating that User Content you uploaded to the Site infringes another’s’ copyrights or otherwise determines in good faith that infringing activity is apparent, EMG will remove such content and apply a first copyright strike and warning to your account.
Should you receive a second copyright strike, you will be considered a repeat infringer and EMG will take all necessary steps to rectify your noncompliance, including without limitation, terminating your account and removing all content uploaded by your account.
Should your account be terminated, EMG may attempt to notify you via the email address you submitted upon registration for the Services.
For more information on how we handle these sorts of claims, please read our Copyright Policy.</p>
<p>With respect to making broadcasts available to mobile users who are listening via EMG’s “Broadcasts” mobile application (“<u>Broadcasts</u>”), EMG has elected to operate under the statutory webcasting licenses codified in Sections 112 and 114 of the Copyright Act and pays royalties to SoundExchange, Inc., the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Board to receive royalty payments from eligible non-interactive services such as Broadcasts.
Unless you opt-out from making your broadcast available to mobile Broadcasts users, you (i) agree to abide by all programming requirements and limitations of our non-interactive service, including but not limited to, those limitations established by Sections 112 and 114 of the Copyright Act (the “<u>Non-Interactive Requirements</u>”), and (ii) will not deliberately attempt to circumvent any Non-Interactive Requirements when making a broadcast available to mobile Broadcasts users.
If EMG determines that you have attempted to disable, circumvent or have failed to comply with any Non-Interactive Requirements or this Agreement, EMG may limit or remove your broadcasting abilities, terminate your account or take any other appropriate legal action against you.</p>
<p>If at any time you believe that you do not have, or no longer have the rights necessary to authorize EMG to make available certain User Content, then you will notify EMG immediately by contacting dmca@grooveshark.com.</p>
