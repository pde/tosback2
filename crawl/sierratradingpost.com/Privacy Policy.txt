<p>Security Policy</p>
<p>Please do not use email to send us your credit card information.
Email communication is not secure.</p>
<p> At Sierra Trading Post, the security of your personal information is our top priority.
We insure confidentiality and security in three ways.</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p>Personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted and sent only over secure Internet lines.
While using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, your Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox browser will let you know when the line is secure.
Internet Explorer and Firefox use a "lock" icon for their browsers.
These "locks" will appear on the browser when using a secure line.
On both browsers the "http:" pre-fix will read "https:" when accessing a secure server.
If these indicators are present, you can be confident of a secure data transaction.</p>
<p>Credit Card information</p>
<p>We do not store complete credit card information on our web server.
Once your order is placed, we send the order to our main order processing system using a "one-way" private network.
If you choose to have us safely store your credit card number on our web server for future ordering convenience, we will only store partial information.
If you choose not to store your credit card information with us, it will be deleted entirely from our web records.</p>
<p>PCI Compliance</p>
<p>We take your financial security seriously and are confident that we have made shopping on our website safe for all customers.
We are compliant with the rigorous security requirements set by the PCI (Payment Card Industry) and have been certified PCI compliant by non-affiliated, third party licensing companies.
We employ various firewalls and other security tactics to keep your information secure.</p>
<p> While there is some risk inherent in every Internet transaction, you can rest assured that we are working overtime to ensure that risk is minimal.</p>
<p> If you are still unsure about the security of your information or if you use a browser that does not support SSL technology, please call us toll free with your information at 1-800-713-4534 or fax us at 1-800-378-8946.</p>
