<p>In your request, please make clear what Personal Data you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Data suppressed from our database, or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Data.
For your protection, we only fulfill requests for the Personal Data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
</p>
<p>Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or reservation, or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such purchase, reservation, or promotion).
There may also be residual data that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
In addition, there may be certain data that we may not allow you to review for legal, security or other reasons.</p>

</p>Retention <p>We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
</p>
<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: </p>
<ul>
<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services)</li>
<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them)</li>
<li>Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations)</li>
</ul>
<p> Back to Top
</p>Sensitive Data <p>Unless specifically requested, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, on or through the Services or otherwise to us, any Sensitive Personal Data (e.g., social security numbers, national identification number, data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, ideological or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, trade union membership, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions).</p>

</p>Cross-Border Transfer <p>The Marriott Group is a global organization and provides a global service.
Sharing data cross-border is essential to the Services so that you receive the same high-quality service wherever you are in the world.
As a result, we will, subject to law, transfer Personal Data and Other Data collected in connection with the Services, to entities in countries where data protection standards may differ from those in the country where you reside.
By making a reservation, visiting or staying at a Marriott branded property or using any Marriott Group branded service, you understand that we transfer your Personal Data globally.
</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries will be entitled to access your Personal Data.
</p>
<p>Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here).
