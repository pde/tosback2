<p>Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Salesforce may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”).
Mobile Applications provided by Salesforce may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application.
For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services.
access the call history on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload that information to the Services.
access calendar information on a User’s Device to enable the User to match meeting attendees with contacts submitted by the User to the Services.

or access contact information on a User’s Device to enable the User to sync contact information between the information that is stored on the User’s Device and the information that is submitted to the Services.
Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services.
Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.</p>
<p>Mobile Applications may provide Salesforce with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Salesforce may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services.
For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken).
Salesforce may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services.
In addition, if a User downloads a Salesforce Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Salesforce, the third-party advertiser may provide Salesforce with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Salesforce may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Customers may configure Salesforce Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration.
In addition, if a Customer purchases more than one Service from Salesforce and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services.
for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services.
Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application.</p>

<p>Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application.
The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices.
The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under Salesforce’s Master Subscription Agreement with the Customer or under this Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Master Subscription Agreement with Salesforce (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to Salesforce’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply.
