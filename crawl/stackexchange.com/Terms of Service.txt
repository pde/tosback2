We created it to give everyone a chance to be recognized by their peers: recognized for their knowledge, their passion, and their willingness to help others get better at the things they are passionate about.
We do ask that you treat our service and community with respect.
Spam, personal attacks, and abusive language do not have a place on the Stack Exchange Network.
If you ever stumble across anything on the Stack Exchange Network that looks like it violates our policies, please be sure to let us know.</p> Accepting the Terms of Service <p>The Stack Exchange Network (the “Network”) is a set of related Internet sites and other applications for questions and answers, owned and operated by Stack Exchange Inc.
(“Stack Exchange”), a Delaware corporation.
Please read these terms of service (“Agreement”) carefully before using the Network or any services provided on the Network (collectively, “Services”).
By using or accessing the Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Services.
The Services are accessed by You (“Subscriber” or “You”) under the following terms and conditions:</p> 1.
Access to the Services <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Stack Exchange may offer to provide the Services, as described more fully on the Network, and which are selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscriber’s own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.
Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services Stack Exchange performs for Subscriber, as well as the offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Network.
Stack Exchange may change, suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content.
Stack Exchange may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict Subscriber’s access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.
Stack Exchange reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting revised Terms of Service on the Network and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the Network.
Subscriber shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.
Use of the Services by Subscriber following such modification constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.</p>
<p>Subscriber certifies to Stack Exchange that Subscriber is an individual (i.e., not a corporate entity) at least 13 years of age.
No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to or on Stack Exchange (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).
Subscriber also certifies that they are legally permitted to use the Services and access the Network, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Network.
This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Network is revoked in such jurisdictions.
Stack Exchange makes no claim that the Network may be lawfully viewed or that Content may be downloaded outside of the United States.
Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries.
If You access the Network from outside the United States, You do so at Your own risk and You are responsible for compliance with the laws of Your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Stack Exchange will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Network and Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
However, there will be occasions when the Network and/or Services will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment.
Every reasonable step will be taken by Stack Exchange to minimize such disruption where it is within Stack Exchange’s reasonable control.</p>
<p>You agree that neither Stack Exchange nor the Network will be liable in any event to You or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Network, the service, any Subscriber Content, or other Content.</p>
<p>Stack Exchange retains the right to create limits on use and storage in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.</p>
<p>Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Network or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service.
Subscriber shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services.</p> 2.

copyright laws, international conventions, and other copyright laws.
Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Subscriber may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, upload, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in this Agreement), create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, software, materials, or Services in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Subscriber may download or copy the Content, and other items displayed on the Network for download, for personal use, provided that Subscriber maintains all copyright and other notices contained in such Content.</p>

In the event You download software from the Network (other than Subscriber Content or Profile Content that is available via the Stack Exchange API), the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and the data accompanying the software (collectively, the “Software”) is licensed to You by Stack Exchange or third party licensors for Your personal, noncommercial use, and no title to the Software shall be transferred to You.
Stack Exchange or third party licensors retain full and complete title to the Software and all intellectual property rights therein.</p> 3.

Restrictions <p>Subscriber is responsible for all of its activity in connection with the Services and accessing the Network.
