How We Secure Your Information
<p>Bankrate’s web servers support the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transaction protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted as an industry standard.
The purpose of this encryption protocol is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth between a web server and its users.
In addition, Bankrate uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, the most powerful encryption commercially available for Internet products (however, be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption level, while secure, is not the highest level available).
We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices.
In addition, a username, member ID name and password are required for you to use, view or change application or interview information.
