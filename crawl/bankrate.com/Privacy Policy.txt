<li>To provide you with personalized advertising on our Services based on your online activity.
We use the information we have to improve our advertising systems so we can show you relevant interest-based advertising, measure the effectiveness and reach of advertisements and services, verify delivery and track performance of an advertising campaign, and ensure that an ad is only delivered when a real person is visiting the site and that the same users don’t see the same ads too frequently.
You may update your preferences regarding personalized advertising by visiting the Cookie Settings link in the footer of each site to manage your settings.</li>
<li>To verify your entry into and eligibility to participate in contests, giveaways, or sweepstakes and inform you if you’ve won.
If your entry information will be used for any other purposes, we will disclose that in the applicable rules governing that contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes.</li>
<li>To monitor, improve, and conduct analytics on our Services and advertiser product offerings.</li>
<li>For internal administrative purposes, such as safety and security of our Services, and to manage our relationships.</li>
<li>To permit you to participate in social sharing, including live social media feeds and to implement Social Features you choose to use.</li>
<li>The Apps in our Services may request to send you push notifications from time to time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.
The Apps may also ask for your permission to access your camera and your photos.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, or if you've initially agreed for the application to access your camera and photos and you would like to stop the Apps from accessing them, you may turn them off at the device level.
To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</li>

<br>
</p>
<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose(s) in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a business need in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our need to conduct our business.</p>
