Qwest has formulated this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") in order to
encourage the responsible use of Qwest's networks, systems, services,
web sites and products (collectively, the "Qwest Network and Services")
by our customers and other users of the Qwest Network and Services
(collectively, "Users"), and to enable us to provide Users with secure,
reliable and productive services.
By using the Qwest Network and
Services, Users consent to be bound by the terms of this AUP.

Qwest will suspend service for violation of the

practical under the circumstances to address the underlying violation.
Qwest will attempt to notify Customer prior to suspending service for
violation of the AUP (which may be via email or any other notification).
provided, however, Qwest may suspend service without notice if Qwest
becomes aware of a violation of any applicable law or regulation or

placed on blacklists.
