</ul>
<p>
<b>Rights of CenturyLink.</b>  </p>
<ul>
<li>CenturyLink may suspend or terminate Service of any User which CenturyLink believes has violated any element of this AUP.  CenturyLink will suspend Service for violation of the AUP on the most limited basis as CenturyLink determines is reasonably practical under the circumstances to address the underlying violation.  CenturyLink will attempt to notify Users via email or other method prior to suspending Service for violation of the AUP.
provided, however, CenturyLink may suspend Service without notice if CenturyLink becomes aware of a violation of any applicable law or regulation or activity, including but not limited to a violation of the AUP that exposes CenturyLink to criminal or civil liability or that exposes the CenturyLink network or CenturyLink customers' network or property to harm.  Such harm to a network may include, but is not limited to, risk of having an IP address placed on blacklists.  CenturyLink may take such further action as CenturyLink determines to be appropriate under the circumstances to eliminate or preclude repeat violations.  </li>
<li>CenturyLink reserves the right to take down any material―or otherwise block access thereto―created or accessible on or through the Services and suspend or terminate any User creating, storing or disseminating such material where CenturyLink becomes aware that the material violates this AUP and/or exposes CenturyLink to civil or criminal liability, including without limitation, under applicable copyright laws.  CenturyLink reserves the right to avail itself to the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</li>
<li>Please click here for information relating to the Service Provider/Designated Agent Information pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C., Section 512(c).</li>
<li>Users are responsible for configuring their own systems to provide the maximum possible accountability.
CenturyLink shall not be liable for any damage caused by such system configurations regardless of whether such configurations have been authorized or requested by CenturyLink.
For example, Users should ensure there are clear "path" lines in news headers so that the originator of a post may be identified.
Users should also configure their Mail Transport Agents (MTA) to authenticate (by look-up on the name or similar procedures) any system that connects to perform a mail exchange, and should generally present header data as clearly possible.
As another example, Users should maintain logs of dynamically assigned IP addresses.
Users are responsible for educating themselves and configuring their systems with at least basic security.
Should systems at a User's site be violated, the User is responsible for reporting the violation and then fixing the exploited system.
For instance, should a site be abused to distribute unlicensed software due to a poorly configured FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Server, the User is responsible for re-configuring the system to stop the abuse.</li>
<li>CenturyLink reserves the right to cooperate with legal authorities and third parties in the investigation of any alleged wrongdoing related to this AUP, including the disclosure of the identity of the User that CenturyLink deems responsible for the wrongdoing.  CenturyLink will not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by any User, or any third party resulting in whole or in part from CenturyLink's exercise of its rights under this AUP.</li>
<li>CenturyLink reserves the right to install and use, or to have you install and use, any appropriate devices to prevent violations of this Policy, including devices designed to filter or terminate access to the Service.  By accepting and using the Service, Users consent to allowing CenturyLink to collect service information and routing information in the normal course of our business, and to use such information for general business purposes.  Users may not use the Service to monitor any data, information or communications on any network or system without authorization.
Users may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the user accounts or passwords of other Users.</li>
<li>In most cases, CenturyLink will notify Users of complaints received by CenturyLink regarding an alleged violation of this Policy.
You agree to promptly investigate all such complaints and take all necessary actions to remedy any violations of this Policy.
CenturyLink may inform the complainant that you are investigating the complaint and may provide the complainant with the necessary information to contact you directly to resolve the complaint.
You shall identify a representative for the purposes of receiving such communications.</li>
<li>CenturyLink reserves the right to modify this AUP in its discretion at any time.
Such modifications will be effective upon posting, and use of the Services after such modification constitutes acceptance of such modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Responsibility for Content.</b>  CenturyLink takes no responsibility for any material created or accessible on or through the Services and will not exercise any editorial control over such material.
 CenturyLink is not obligated to monitor such material, but reserves the right to do so.</p>
<p>Violations of this AUP may be reported to: abuse@centurylinkservices.net.</p>
