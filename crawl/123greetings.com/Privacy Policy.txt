<p>123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website.
This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard.

Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network.

</p>
<p>If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>
