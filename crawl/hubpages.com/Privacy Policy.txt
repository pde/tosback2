</p>
<p>Maven Coalition, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and its affiliated businesses including Sports Illustrated, TheStreet, HubPages, Inc., and Say Media, Inc.
(collectively, “Maven,” “we,” or “us”), offers a digital media platform that allows partners to create and monetize content by allowing Maven and its partners to show advertisements on such content.
We refer to these content creators as “Partners” and to the websites and apps that participate in our coalition as “Partner Content.” </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Maven collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you visit our websites and Partner Content, open an account or publish content with us, contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.
We collectively refer to these touchpoints as our “Services.” </p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification).
We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

<strong>
<em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.

<li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased.
and </li>
<li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Deletion Request Rights</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code § 1546 <em>et.
seq.</em>).</li>
<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: </p>
<ul>
<li>Emailing us at “<strong>CCPA-maven@maven.io</strong>”</li>
<li>Calling us at 1-866-321-8726</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:<ul>
<li>First name, last name, email address, postal address, phone number</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
</p>
<p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Response Timing and Format</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the email address on file for that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response electronically to the email that you provided to us as part of your request.
</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide may only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out").
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
</p>
<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the applicable the website (among those listed in the introductory paragraph in our Terms Of Use) and clicking on the “Do Not Sell My Info” link directly on that website and then completing the CCPA Opt-Out Manager submission.
