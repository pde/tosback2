 Terms of Service Overview
<p>Below is an overview of our Terms of Service for our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or service we offer.
You should read the complete Terms of Service because that document (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement.
<em>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</em>

<p>Your Relationship with Meetup</p>

</ul>
<p>Our Platform</p>

Occasionally things may not go exactly as planned.
We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.</li>

) <p>Our Terms of Service contain important information about your legal rights.
To make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these gray boxes.
These summaries are not part of the official terms, and it is important for you to read the language in each section carefully.</p> 1.
This Agreement <p>Summary:
You agree to follow some basic rules when using Meetup’s Platform.
These rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below.
We may change these rules.</p>
<p>1.1 The Agreement.
Meetup enables you and other members to arrange off-line, real-world Meetup groups and Meetup events.
The terms “Meetup,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Meetup, Inc.
and our affiliates.
We use the terms “you” and “your” to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf.
We use the word “Platform” to mean any website, application, or service offered by Meetup, including content we offer and electronic communications we send.
We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service.
We use the terms “Terms of Service” and “Agreement” interchangeably to mean this document together with our Usage and Content Policies, Group Policies, Organizer and Leadership Standards, Member Restrictions, Payment Policies, and Trademark Usage Guidelines.
Your use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement.
If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement.
If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.</p>
<p>Tip:
We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and are intended to have no legal effect.</p>
<p>Tip:
These Terms of Service are an agreement between you and Meetup and not between you and any other member.
For more information, see our FAQ page explaining the parties to our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>1.2 Revisions to this Agreement.
We may modify this Agreement from time to time.
When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page.
If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.
By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>
2.
Your Account and Membership <p>Summary:
You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform.
Meetup organizers control the Content and membership of their Meetup groups.
However, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.</p>
<p>2.1 Eligibility.
Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old.
You represent that you are at least 18.
Additional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform.
For example, the eligibility requirements for a Meetup group or Meetup event may be set by the organizers of that group.</p>
<p>2.2 Suspension of Your Account.
We may modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Meetup community, or to protect our brand or Platform.
We also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>A member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our Platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.</p>
<p>2.3 Account Information and Security.
When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password.
Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate.
Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account).
You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others.
If someone is using your password, notify us immediately.</p>
3.
Fees, Payments, and Offers <p>Summary:
We charge for certain features on our Platform.
If you’re a Meetup group organizer, you’re responsible for paying for organizer subscription fees related to your Meetup group.
These fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future.
Additionally, some organizers charge money for participation in a Meetup group or Meetup event.</p>
<p>3.1 Fees Charged by Meetup.
Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features.
We may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform.
If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you advanced notice such as by posting changes on our Platform or sending you an email.
You agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service.
Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S.
dollars.
All fees are exclusive of applicable federal, state, local, or other taxes.
Organizer subscriptions are non-transferable.</p>
<p> 3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers.
Organizers may impose fees related to particular portions of the Platform, such as member dues for a Meetup group or an event fee for a Meetup event.
The decision to charge fees and the amount of those fees is at the discretion of those organizers.
We reserve the right to initiate refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service.
Refunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our Payment Policies.
Organizers may also have their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit members’ ability to receive refunds under our Payment Policies.
Payments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider.
If a member pays a fee to an organizer via the Platform, the member authorizes the organizer (and the organizer’s applicable payment service provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges.
Certain types of fees charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis.
If billed on a recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to the designated payment method.
You may cancel auto-renewal at any time.</p>
<p>Tip:
You should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to any organizer.
We cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they promise or as you expect.
You should check the refund policy of the Meetup group before making any payments to an organizer.</p>
<p>3.3 Payments to Meetup.
Organizers are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to Meetup on time and through our approved payment methods.
Organizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the organizer of the Meetup groups associated with their account, and their Meetup group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that Meetup group) may be terminated or transferred to another member.
If we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees paid to Meetup.
You may only pay organizer fees to Meetup using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform.
You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Platform.
You authorize us (and our designated third-party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the total amount of any fees you owe to Meetup, including any applicable taxes and other charges.
If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled.
We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processors to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received.
We also may issue refunds, or instruct our payment processors to issue refunds, in accordance with our Payment Policies.</p>
<p>Tip:
To learn more about organizer subscriptions and what happens if they expire, see this FAQ on Expired Plans.</p>
<p>3.4 Automatic Subscription Renewals.
Fees for certain aspects of our Platform may be billed on either a recurring basis or on a one-time basis.
If billed on a recurring basis, the fees are payable in advance of the applicable period specified via the Platform with no refunds.
We will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation.
By purchasing any feature or other aspect of our Platform for which we charge, you authorize us to keep your payment current by charging your credit card account (or any other means of payment used by you) the applicable fee.
While you may cancel auto-renewal or cancel your subscription at any time, you won’t be issued a refund except in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Tip:
To cancel your organizer subscription, see this FAQ on Modifying Subscriptions.</p>
<p>3.5 Free Trials.
We may offer free trials of subscriptions and other products on our Platform.
We will inform you of the length of the free trial, your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment.
After your free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation.
You can cancel automatic subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures described above.</p>
<p>3.6 Third Party Payment Processors.
An organizer that uses the Platform to accept payments from other members, must comply with the terms and conditions of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment.
Meetup does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.</p>
<p>3.7 Third Party Transactions.
Your Meetup group or its members may receive offers from third parties, such as discounts, sponsorships, or other benefits.
Meetup is not involved in any dealings or payments between you and third parties, and these Terms of Service do not govern such transactions.</p>

<p>Tip:
This license doesn’t give us ownership of any of your Content.
It simply gives us and members the right to use it on or related to the Platform.
This license continues even if you close your account, because it’s necessary for us to operate the Platform.</p>
<p>4.3 Privacy.
Meetup collects registration and other information about you through our Platform.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy for details on how we collect, use, and disclose this information.
These policies do not govern use of information that you provide to third parties, such as other members of Meetup’s Platform.</p>

9.
Dispute Resolution <p>Summary:
If you have a dispute with Meetup, you agree to try to work it out directly with us first.
If we can’t work it out, with limited exceptions, you must submit any dispute with us to a neutral arbitrator instead of taking the claim to a court of law.
Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.
Meetup has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other members, although we may try to facilitate a resolution.</p>
<p>9.1 Informal Resolution.
Before making any claim, you and Meetup agree to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions.
We use the term “claim” in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation in Meetup events.
You or Meetup may initiate this process by sending written notice according to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution.
In the event that we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days of receipt of the initial notice, you or Meetup may bring a claim in accordance with Section 9.2.</p>
<p>9.2 Arbitration Agreement.
Except as set forth in Section 9.5, you agree to submit any claim to JAMS, Inc., or its successor, (“JAMS”) for final and binding arbitration.
In arbitration certain rights that you or we would have in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal.
You and Meetup are each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law.
This agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises during or after any termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Meetup.</p>
<p>9.3 Arbitration Time for Filing.
Any claim subject to arbitration must be filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>9.4 Arbitration Procedures.
Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2.
The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires (“JAMS Rules”) in effect as of the demand for arbitration.
You agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules.
Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules.
The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>9.5 Exceptions.
You or Meetup may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any U.S.
county where you live or work.
You or Meetup may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Meetup pending the completion of arbitration.
Meetup may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property.
Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Meetup’s right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.</p>
<p>9.6 Arbitration Opt Out.
You may decline to resolve disputes through arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@meetup.com within 30 days of the date you first agree to this Agreement.
Your email must include your full name, residential address, the email address registered to your Meetup account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration.
If you opt out according to this process, then Sections 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 of this Agreement do not apply to you.
This opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.5 (Exceptions), 9.7 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).</p>
<p>9.7 Class Action Waiver.
You agree to resolve disputes with Meetup on an individual basis.
You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated or representative action.
You are expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations.</p>
