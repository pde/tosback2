</p>
BINDING ARBITRATION
<p> You and Office Depot agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site, use of the Site, these Terms of Use, Mobile Terms of Use and/or the Privacy Policy shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you in your hometown area), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by both Office Depot and you, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (JAMS Rules and Procedures), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267.
The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures.
Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
The arbitrator shall apply Florida law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
If you initiate arbitration against Office Depot, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrators services or any other JAMS fees.
If Office Depot initiates arbitration against you, Office Depot will pay for the arbitrators services and any other JAMS fees associated with the arbitration.
If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Office Depot shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.
BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.
DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.
