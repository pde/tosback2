<strong>* Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW (AND EXCEPT AS TO PUERTO RICO CUSTOMERS), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT</strong>.
This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
We each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 27).
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, <strong>YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE EARLIER OF THE DATE YOU PURCHASED A DEVICE FROM US OR THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE, OR FOR A LINE OF SERVICE THAT WAS ACTIVATED PRIOR TO JUNE 28, 2008, <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE FIRST TIME AFTER DECEMBER 30, 2011 WHEN YOU AGREED TO EXTEND OR RENEW YOUR TERM OF SERVICE FOR THAT LINE (the "Opt Out Deadline")</strong>.
You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service.
You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or completing the opt-out form located at www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com.
<strong>Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>
</p>
<p>For all disputes (except for Puerto Rico customers), whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below.
We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration.
We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings</strong>.
You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section.
16) to begin arbitration.
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will arbitrate all disputes.
For claims less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
for claims over $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000.
For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys' fees.
In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
Except for claims determined to be frivolous, T-Mobile agrees not to seek an award of attorneys' fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.
<strong>Puerto Rico customers</strong>: Refer to Section 15 for details on the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Dispute Procedure.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>
</strong>.
<strong>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION</strong>.
If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.
<strong>If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</u>
</strong>.
If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, <strong>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>.</p>
</li>

<p>
<strong>* Your Term of Service and Early Termination Fees</strong>.
Some Rate Plans are month-to-month and some Rate Plans require a Service Term.
Your "Term" is the period of time for which you have agreed to maintain Service with us.
Periods of suspension of Service do not count toward your Term.
After your Term ends, you will become a month-to-month customer.
Except for month-to-month customers, <strong>AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE WILL APPLY TO EACH LINE OF SERVICE IF YOU DO NOT MAINTAIN YOUR AGREED-UPON SERVICES THROUGH THE END OF YOUR TERM FOR THAT LINE OF SERVICE, OR IF WE TERMINATE YOUR SERVICE EARLY (see Section 19).
THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE IS: $200 IF TERMINATION OCCURS WITH MORE THAN 180 DAYS REMAINING ON YOUR TERM.
$100 IF TERMINATION OCCURS WITH 91 TO 180 DAYS REMAINING ON YOUR TERM.
$50 IF TERMINATION OCCURS WITH 31 TO 90 DAYS REMAINING ON YOUR TERM.
AND THE LESSER OF $50 OR YOUR MONTHLY RECURRING CHARGES (including any applicable taxes and fees) IF TERMINATION OCCURS IN THE LAST 30 DAYS OF YOUR TERM</strong>.
Some Devices require maintaining certain features or Services (e.g.
a data plan) as part of your Rate Plan, and cancelling them before the end of your Term will result in an Early Termination Fee.
<strong>The Early Termination Fee is part of our rates and is not a penalty</strong>.
The Early Termination Fee applies only to the extent permitted by law.
If you terminate your Service, your termination will be effective at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will remain responsible for all fees and Charges for your Service and usage through the end of that billing cycle.
If we terminate your Service, we will determine the date of termination, and you will be responsible for all usage and Charges through the date of termination.
You can request us to port your number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete.
If you port your number, you are responsible for all usage and Charges through the end of your current billing cycle.
If you bought your wireless Device from a Dealer, they may charge a separate fee associated with cancellation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>* Cancellation and Returns</strong>.
<strong>
<u>Service Cancellation</u>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Changes to Your Service</strong>.
You may be unable to change your Rate Plan, including services and features associated with your Rate Plan.
You may request to change to another Rate Plan during your Term, and if we authorize the change, you may be charged a migration fee of up to the amount of the Early Termination Fee for each line of service, and you may continue to be bound to your existing Term or an extended Term.

actual Service area, coverage and quality may vary and change without notice depending on a variety of factors including network capacity, terrain and weather.
Outages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies.
You agree we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information and Emergency Alerts</strong>.
When making a 9-1-1 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information.
<strong>T-Mobile is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 9-1-1 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.
9-1-1 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded</strong>.
We may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, our wireless network, the street address you have provided us as your primary use location ("Primary Address") or the location of a known Wi-Fi access point.
Even with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services.
Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and T-Mobile does not determine the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed.
If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is in process.
If you dial 9-1-1 while outside the U.S., 9-1-1 services may not be available.
<strong>
<u>Wi-Fi and 9-1-1 Service</u>
</strong>: Calling 9-1-1 via Wi-Fi services uses the internet and operates differently than traditional 9-1-1.
For example, 9-1-1 service may not work during power or internet (e.g., cable service) outages or disruptions, or if your internet or T-Mobile Service are suspended.
Location information when using Wi-Fi may be limited or unavailable.
You must provide us with a Primary Address to use Wi-Fi services.
If the location at which you primarily use Wi-Fi changes, either temporarily or permanently, you must register the new address via www.my.T-Mobile.com or by contacting T-Mobile's Customer Care.
it may take 24 hours or more to update the address information.
If you do not give us a Primary Address, we may block your usage of certain Wi-Fi networks.
When you call 9-1-1 over Wi-Fi away from your Primary Address, we may have no or very limited information about your location.
<strong>
<u>Text-to-911</u>
</strong>: Text-to-911: Text to 9-1-1 may be available in some locations where T-Mobile service is provided, and is dependent on the public safety agency's ability to receive text messaging.
<strong>T-Mobile recommends that you use voice communications as your primary method of contacting 9-1-1.</strong>
<strong>
<u>Emergency Alerts</u>
</strong>.
T-Mobile has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts, within portions of its coverage area, on wireless alert capable Devices.
There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.
For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable Devices, please visit www.T-Mobile.com.</p>

<p>
<strong>* Billing.
You agree to pay all Charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device</strong>.
For disputed Charges, see Section 15.
You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to report all changes within 30 days of the change.
We round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.
Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up).
Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, the rate for a call is determined by the time the call starts, and that rate applies to the entire call.
If we cannot determine the time of your call, we may base the time on the local time associated with your billing address.
For some products, such as Prepaid Service, each minute of a call will be billed according to the time or day applicable to that minute.
You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging).
Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle.
Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed Rate Plan Allotments in a later billing cycle.
Unused Rate Plan Allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle.
Airtime usage applies to all calls processed through your Device, including toll-free, operator-assisted, voice mail, call forwarding and calling card calls.
You may be billed additional Charges or fees for certain features and services such as operator or directory assistance, data calls or transfers, messaging, internet access and applications.
<strong>
<u>Third-Party Service Provider Billing:</u>
</strong> Your Device can be used to purchase services and products from third-party providers and Charges for these purchases may be included on your T-Mobile bill.
You can block those purchases of third-party products or services by visiting www.T-Mobile.com or calling Customer Care.
<strong>
<u>Data Usage and Messaging:</u>
</strong> Depending upon your Rate Plan, data usage may be rounded at the end of each data session, at the end of your billing cycle, and/or at the time you switch data plans.
See www.T-Mobile.com for your Rate Plan details.
You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.
We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.
Additional blocking options are available at www.my.T-Mobile.com.
<strong>
<u>Wi-Fi Billing:</u>
</strong> Billing for Wi-Fi usage will be based on the network (Wi-Fi or cellular) to which your Device was connected at the start of the call or other Service.
Check your Device indicator to know if you are on a cellular or Wi-Fi network.
Additional incoming and outgoing calls initiated while you are already connected to a network (e.g., call waiting, call forwarding, conference calling) are also billed based upon the network upon which the original call was initiated.
Calls may drop if you move between Wi-Fi networks or between Wi-Fi networks and a cellular network.
We will bill you based on the time at the location of the Wi-Fi network (or a nearby cell tower) if we know its location.
If we are unable to determine the location of the Wi-Fi network, we may base the time of the call on the local time of your billing address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>* Data Plans and Other Features</strong>.
Your Device may not be able to access data, or you may be charged for data usage on a pay per use basis, unless data Service is included in your Rate Plan or data pass (collectively "Data Plan").
<strong>
<u>Additional important information about your Data Plan can be found at http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/CompanyInfo.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_ConsumerInfo&amp;tsp=Abt_Sub_InternetServices.
Permissible and Prohibited Uses</u>
</strong>.
Your Data Plan is intended for Web browsing, messaging, and similar activities.
Examples of other uses that are not permitted because they are a misuse of your Device or your Service can be found in Section 18.
Tethering your Device to other lawful devices is permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions and allotments of your Data Plan.
<strong>
<u>Protective Measures</u>
</strong>: To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we take certain steps to manage our network, including, but not limited to, prioritizing the data usage of Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more than 21 GB of data during a billing cycle below that of other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources for the remainder of their billing cycle.
Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is de-prioritized will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority.
This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.
At times and locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, these customers will likely see significant reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities.
T-Mobile constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and in constrained locations the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than in other locations.
When network loading goes down or the customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the customer's speeds will likely improve.
See www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet for details and for current data amount subject to this practice.
In addition, if you exceed the amount specified in your Data Plan during a billing cycle, we may reduce your data speed for the remainder of that billing cycle.
If you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers' service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data sessions, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan.
We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services.
Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as deploying streaming video optimization technology.
This technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.
Streaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.
The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it.
While most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a users device.
These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by T-Mobile on the basis of such competition.

<u>Taxes and Fees</u>
</strong>.
<strong>You agree to pay all taxes and fees imposed by governments or governmental entities</strong>.

fees.
To determine taxes &amp.
fees, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use ("PPU").
The PPU for <strong>Puerto Rico customers</strong> must be in Puerto Rico.
If you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address (such as a PO box) that is not a recognized street address, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes.
In the event of a disputed tax jurisdiction location or with respect to any disagreement regarding the taxes and fees assessed on your bill, you must request a tax refund within 60 days of our notification to you that the tax has been assessed.
<strong>
<u>Surcharges</u>

Surcharges are not mandated by law, they are T-Mobile Charges that are collected and retained by T-Mobile.
The components and amounts of these Charges are subject to change without notice.
Surcharges include, but are not limited to, charges, costs, fees and certain taxes T-Mobile incurs to provide Services (and are not government taxes or fees imposed directly on our customers that we must collect by law).
Examples include general and administrative fees (such as certain costs we incur to provide Service) as well as governmental-related Surcharges (such as Federal or State Universal Service fees, regulatory fees, and gross receipts taxes).
Surcharges will apply whether or not you benefit from the programs, activities or services included in the Surcharge.
You can find the Surcharges in either the "Taxes, Fees &amp.
Surcharges" or the "Other Charges" section of your bill.</p>
