<p>
<strong>(iii)	License to SPE of Your UGC.</strong> Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a promotion’s official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your UGC, you hereby grant SPE, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your UGC (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same.

To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.

<li>DISPUTES AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</li>
<p>
<strong>A.
Forum Selection/Jurisdiction.</strong> Jurisdiction and venue for any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, the content, your UGC, these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, whether before the Effective Date of these Terms or after arising (collectively, "<strong>Dispute</strong>") shall be in Los Angeles, California.
Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Los Angeles, California for any and all purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>B.
Pre-Arbitration Notification.</strong> SPE and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated.
provided, however, that SPE need not do so in circumstances where its claims of intellectual property rights are concerned ("<strong>IP Disputes</strong>," with all other disputes referred to as "<strong>General Disputes</strong>").
The party making a claim – whether you or SPE – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief.
If SPE is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your SPE account, if applicable.
If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 9.B.
If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.
10202 West Washington Blvd., Culver City, CA 90232 (Attn: General Counsel -- Claims).
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate arbitration proceedings as set forth in this Section 9.
Either you or SPE, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to Section 9.D) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.</p>
<p>
<strong>C.
Arbitration of Claims.
</strong> All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof and/or the scope of the provisions of this Section shall be submitted to JAMS for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in Los Angeles County, California, before a single arbitrator in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1280 et seq.
The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS.
The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public.
provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers.
The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent.
The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based.
Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award.
provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of the Agreement waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California or, if sought by SPE, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section.
provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.

<strong>E.
Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, Dispute and IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against SPE or by SPE against you pursuant to this Section 9, or otherwise related to the Service, content, SPE Licensed Elements, UGC or other SPE products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction.
This Section 9 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis.
You and SPE agree that we intend that this Section 9 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
This Section 9 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 9 in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
</p>
<p>
<strong>F.
Class Action Waiver.
</strong> Both you and SPE waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else.
Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding.
Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 9 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.</p>
<p>
<strong>G.
Jury Waiver.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.
The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 9.G are currently unenforceable under California law but mutually intend for this Section to apply in the event such provisions later become enforceable under California law.</strong>

<p>
<strong>H.
Limited Time To File Claims.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A GENERAL DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN IP DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.B) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
</strong>

<strong>I.
Small Claims Matters.

<p>
<strong>J.</strong>	The provisions of this Section shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties.
This Section 9 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.</p>
