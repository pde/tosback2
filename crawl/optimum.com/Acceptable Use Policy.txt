<b>Here is specific information on OPTIMUMISP's policy with respect to mass email mailings, multiple Usenet News postings and other mass unsolicited communications - these are all commonly known as SPAM.</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>The Internet user community does not welcome unsolicited email from any source.
This "junk email" is commonly referred to as "SPAM".
You can learn more about SPAM </b>
<b>here</b>
<b>.
In addition to SPAM, multiple postings of the same information to many Usenet Newsgroups and advertising in most of the Usenet Newsgroups is also unwelcome.
Here is good link for Usenet SPAM information.  </b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>If you are receiving SPAM, you may be able to set up filters on your email or news reader that will help to minimize the unwanted SPAM.
OPTIMUMISP's engineering and network operations center has attempted to minimize the quantity of SPAM being received by our email and news systems.
Unfortunately, there is no way to totally eliminate SPAM technically, and the laws for junk email are only forming as of today.
The best way to deal with SPAM is to simply delete the email or offending message and move on.
<u>Never</u> retaliate against a SPAMMER destructively- this will only make the situation worse and your retaliation may be very illegal as it can cause damage to OPTIMUMISP networks and other networks or systems.
</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Specifically:</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>OPTIMUMISP <u>does not allow</u> our network resources to be used by anyone to email or mass-email any user or groups of users especially those that have not indicated a willingness to receive such mailings.</b>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>OPTIMUMISP <u>does not allow</u> our systems to be used for RELAY from non-OPTIMUMISP customers or networks. </b>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>OPTIMUMISP <u>does not knowingly allow</u> our systems to be used for any activity that is illegal. </b>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>OPTIMUMISP <u>does not allow</u> customers or other networks' connections to consume excessive resources from our systems.</b>
<b>
</b>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>OPTIMUMISP <u>does not allow</u> our customers to use other providers' mail servers to relay any type of email without the express consent of that provider.</b>
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>ALL OPTIMUMISP dial-up, direct connect Internet accounts and customer web pages <u>cannot be used for mass emailing of any type</u>.
Mass emailing is defined as the sending of any number of messages to random email addresses, or the running of any mailing list, whether or not the list of recipients are willing to receive such mailings.
If you wish to run a responsible mailing list of any type, please call OPTIMUMISP at 973-357-3700 ext 312 for information on that optional service.</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>If we find a violation of the above, OPTIMUMISP will immediately suspend that customer's account without prior notice or warning. </b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>GENERAL POLICIES</i>
</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Censorship:</i>
</b> OPTIMUMISP has a policy of no-censorship, either from or to our systems, <u>UNLESS, the information transmitted is illegal or is clearly used for fraud</u>.
The "warez" and "crack" Usenet news groups are an example of this.
(<i>OPTIMUMISP does not carry the warez or crack groups</i>).  <p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>User Transmitted Content:</i>
</b> You are solely responsible for the information you publish over the Internet, either via email, Netnews, your personal web pages, or other service.
You must not infringe on any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy.
You must not violate any law, statue, ordinance, or regulation.
You must not be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing.
The information you transmit should not be obscene or contain child pornography or any otherwise illegal pornographic or indecent material.
The information you transmit must not intentionally contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data, or personal information.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Account Usage:</i>
</b>
<b> Your account is for <u>your exclusive and individual use only</u>.
multiple concurrent logins of the same account are not allowed.
Beyond the fact that allowing others to use your account is prohibited, consider that you become responsible for the charges incurred by someone else that you have allowed to use your account.
For this reason you must protect your account and password as you would any other personal resource such as your telephone or credit card number.
</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Resource Usage:</i>
</b>
<b> No communications system has unlimited resources, and we expect you to act responsibly when consuming resources on our system.
The Resource Usage policy applies to any and all OPTIMUMISP resources used by our Customers, including the size of your email box.
Further, Customers using OPTIMUMISP Personal "On-Demand" dial-up analog modem or ISDN accounts may not run <u>any servers</u>, such as HTTP, FTP or MAIL, IRC, QUAKE or GAME servers.
Excessive concurrent processes or processes which continue after you have logged off are prohibited.
Our servers automatically end long idle calls, and during peak times you can expect <u>minimum</u> allowed idle time of at least 15 minutes.
Users that stay connected for more than 6 (six) continuous hours may be subject to automatic disconnection.
If this should occur while you are still on-line <u>and interactively</u> using the Internet, simply re-dial and login again.
No connection may be used for more than 12 continuous hours - this is called "hanging" and OPTIMUMISP considers this an excessive use of our resources.
If you consume excessive resources on our system we may suspend your access at any time without prior notice.  </b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>email Storage</i>
</b>: It is the responsibility of the Customer to permanently store, save or retain any email messages that are desirable to save and keep.
The size of your incoming email temporary storage at OPTIMUMISP is <i>very liberal</i> but not unlimited in size.
Most Customers will never exceed the limits under normal use.
However, excessively large temporary email boxes create a Resource Usage problem and violate our AUP.
To avoid this, Customers may not use OPTIMUMISP's email servers for permanent or long-term storage.
Customer Support at OPTIMUMISP will assist you in configuring your email client NOT to store messages on OPTIMUMISP's servers.
instead to store those message locally on your computer.
Please call Customer Support at 973-357-3700 ext 311 for more information.
If you begin to have an email box that is too large, you will receive an automatic message that asks you to clean-up (move or delete old mail) your email box.
Again OPTIMUMISP's Customer Service can help you with this simple procedure.
If you ignore the warning message, OPTIMUMISP's mail server will stop delivering email to your account until you reduce the size of your email box.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>How much storage is allowed?</b> At least 5 Mb per email account <u>which is plenty for all normal uses</u>.
The email system is purposely designed to occasionally allow you to temporarily exceed this limit for short periods of time.
As long as you cleanup your email box regularly, you'll never have a storage problem.
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> the size of your email box is a resource that falls under the Resource Usage policy, above.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>

</b>
<b> OPTIMUMISP actively and automatically monitors all of our systems for attempts at breaching our security or the security of our customers, or attempts to access systems or resources that are not available for customers to use or access.
