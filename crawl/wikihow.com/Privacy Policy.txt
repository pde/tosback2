August 25, 2011 Article Edit Discuss <p>Every site has its legal Terms of Use.
The bottom of this page contains our "Terms of Use Agreement".
Before you read it, you might want to first review our plain English guidelines to the wikiHow community:</p>
<p>1.
<b>A civil group effort</b>
</p>
<p>wikiHow is a group effort to create a great resource: the world's largest free how to manual.
You must expect your writing to be modified, criticized constructively, or improved by others.
Changes should be viewed in the spirit of improvement and not as a criticism of your approach or capabilities.
On the other hand, when editing someone else's work, always be friendly, civil, and supportive.
Never make any personal attacks.
Assume good faith in everyone's efforts.
Remember that wikiHow contributors volunteer to help build this great resource, so please be nice to them.
When you disagree with another wikiHow community member please stay cool and talk things over civilly.
Writers and editors who can't cooperate and work for the best interest of the group will be discouraged or prevented from participating.</p>
<p>2.
<b>Helpful instructions</b>
</p>
<p>wikiHow articles should help people solve their everyday problems.
We believe that profanity, adult content, hate based, recreational drug focused, joke topics, societal instructions, and vanity pages are inappropriate for wikiHow.
Topics that pose very high odds of injury or death or are universally illegal will also be deleted.</p>
<p>3.
<b>Limit egregious self-advertising</b>
</p>
<p>wikiHow exists to help people, not for product promotion.
While we encourage useful articles about how to shop and buy things, writers should refrain from creating articles to purely promote one specific business without providing useful insights to our readers.
While you are welcome to post an external hyperlink, the wikiHow community reserves the right to delete hyperlinks or entire articles that over step the bounds on self-advertising.</p>
<p>For details read the wikiHow policy summary.</p>
<p>4.
<b>Creative Commons Licensed</b>
</p>
<p>wikiHow licenses its text under a Creative Commons License.
The license allows wikiHow content to be used freely for noncommercial purposes.
Allowing free republication of our content helps achieve wikiHow's mission by offering our instructions to the problems of everyday life to even more people for free.
In addition, our license allows for the creation of derivative works under the same license.
The ability to make derivative works enables the future creation of others and creates a "right to fork" which essentially guarantees that the wikiHow project will always be free and community controlled.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading these site guidelines.
Here is wikiHow's Terms of Use:</p>
