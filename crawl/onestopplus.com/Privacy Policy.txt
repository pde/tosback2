<strong>SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND MOBILE SITES</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>See Privacy Policy for additional terms governing our Social Media Sites and Mobile Sites.</strong>
</p>   <p>
<strong>TAXES</strong>
</p>
<p>
We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states.
For states imposing sales or use
taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation.
Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over
the Internet or by other remote means.
Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting all of the taxable purchases that were
not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases.
Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing
authorities.</p>   <p>
<strong>JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW</strong>
</p>
<p>
By accessing this Site and/or using our Services, you agree that these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles.
No software from this Site may be downloaded, exported or re-exported in violation of any law including, without limitation, to countries that are subject to U.S.
export restrictions.</p>
<strong>DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</strong>
<p>
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Services, including products or services sold or distributed through our websites and catalogs, any dealings with us and our customer service agents, any representations made by us, and/or your use of our websites (including without limitation claims relating to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis.
This includes any dispute or claim you assert against our subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns.
This also includes any dispute or claim that arose before you accepted these revised Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.
</p>
<p>
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Unless we both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, consolidated or class proceeding.
If the requirements of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial described below.
Without limiting the foregoing, if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, WE EACH HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
We also both agree that either of us may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") rules, except as provided in this section.
If your total claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person.
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
If a dispute arises, we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court.
We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly.
</p>
<p>
If your dispute is not resolved by Customer Service, before beginning arbitration, please send written notice describing the claim to the Office of the General Counsel at the following address:
</p>
<p> FULLBEAUTY Brands<br> One New York Plaza<br> New York, New York 10004<br> ATTN: General Counsel<br> Email: GeneralCounsel@FBBrands.com</p>
<p>
If the claim has not been resolved within 30 days of sending the notice, you may then commence an arbitration proceeding.
The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 877-495-4185.
