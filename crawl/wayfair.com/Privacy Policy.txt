The "net amount" shall mean the cash amount paid by the Member for the product(s) purchased in connection with the Transaction, excluding any payment of applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges and after applying any discounts or other credits.

</ul> Becoming a Supplier <strong>Interested In Being a Supplier?</strong>
<br> The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and reach a new and growing set of customers.
For seven years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap into this growth while working closely with them to protect and promote their brand, complement their existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics and communications flow.
We understand the importance of flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our suppliers' specific needs.
We value our 2,000+ supplier relationships and believe these to be the key elements to fostering a successful partnership: <strong>Commitment to Growth</strong> - Our goal is to rapidly grow revenues and become the top online channel partner for each of our suppliers.
Our category teams' significant product expertise combined with our ongoing investment in online, email and traditional marketing, ensures maximum impact as we launch new suppliers' products.
<strong>Partnership in Customer Service Excellence</strong> - Wayfair's ability to provide great customer service begins with our supplier's commitment to ship orders quickly, package products with care, provide accurate in-stock status and work with us to rapidly handle any issues that may arise.
<strong>Brand and Channel Integrity</strong> - Wayfair is absolutely committed to helping its suppliers' brand flourish online.
We collaborate with our suppliers to tell their products' stories the way they want them told.
We are sensitive to our suppliers' desire to have a consistent value proposition and brand message across all of their retail outlets and we work closely to ensure our relationship is complementary to our suppliers' existing sales channels.
<strong>Flexibility and Ease</strong> - Each of our suppliers works closely with a Wayfair category team that is highly proficient at taking the supplier though the entire process of: (1) establishing the relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product, (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer service.
We understand that every supplier may have unique needs in areas of logistics, order flow, payments, returns, etc.
and we try to tune our approach to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire process as smooth and seamless as possible.
