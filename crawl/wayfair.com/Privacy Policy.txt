clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags) to personalize your experience of the Service and to generate information about Service traffic and trends.
Web beacons collect General Information, such as the type of browser that you use and your IP address.

<p> Third-party advertisers also help us display tailored content to our customers and serve advertising on our behalf.
These advertisers may also utilize cookies and/or web beacons to collect General Information about your activities on the Service, to target advertising based upon your interests and to measure effectiveness of the Service.
Our systems do not currently recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but if you wish to not have General Information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may be able to opt-out by visiting http://www.youradchoices.com or similar online resources about behavioral advertising.

</p>
<p> Legal Disputes
</p>
<p> YOU AND Wayfair AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
</p>
<p> Any dispute between you and Wayfair, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, '<strong>Wayfair</strong>') arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "<strong>Covered Disputes</strong>") will be settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in effect on the date thereof.
Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration.
Wayfair will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by e-mail to [legal@wayfair.com].
</p>
<p> During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes.
Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.
The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review.
Wayfair and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.
Neither Wayfair nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.
If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms of Use must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.
For purposes of this section, these Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.

1-16 (FAA).
