 <strong>GodTube Community Guidelines</strong>
<p>
1.     It will be assumed that community members will have read and agreed to these community guidelines (“Community Guidelines”) for Godtube.com (the “Site”) and, by occasional rereading of them, to be aware of changes and updates to the Community Guidelines. </p>

a.     It is your responsibility to periodically check the rules and make yourself aware of any changes. </p>
<p>
2.     Only members who have registered with full registration data including real name and a valid e-mail address are permitted in community areas.
Failure to register, or registration with false information, especially misrepresentation of age, gender or email address, is grounds for immediate blocking of access.
Additionally, it is the member's responsibility to update and maintain a valid email address with their membership. </p>
<p>
a.     Forums, videos, blogs, article comments and profile comments are all considered "community areas". </p>
<p>
b.     Use of multiple names is limited to no more than two usernames.
Given the benefits of anonymity in discussing certain personal issues which may appropriately be discussed in some community settings, use of a different username to protect privacy may be appropriate.
Community volunteers may also wish to use different identities for monitoring and personal interaction.
However, individuals who have been locked, barred, secured, or banned are not permitted to create a new account as a way to circumnavigate the consequences for violating the Terms of Service.
Salem Web Network reserves the right to terminate any new accounts which have been established in this manner as well as remove any content posted. </p>
<p>
3.     Community members understand that, notwithstanding our commitment to providing the safest and most Christian values sensitive community environment possible, participating in the online community is done at one's own risk.
