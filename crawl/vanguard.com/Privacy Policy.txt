<i>The following privacy policy is provided by the Vanguard funds, The Vanguard Group, Inc., Vanguard Marketing Corporation, Vanguard Advisers, Inc., Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company, and Vanguard National Trust Company.</i>

<p>
<b>Our commitment to you</b>
</p>
<p>As a Vanguard investor, you have entrusted to our care not only your hard-earned money but your personal and financial data as well.
We recognize that your relationship with us is based on trust, and that you expect us to act responsibly and in your best interests.
Because your personal and financial data are your private information, we hold ourselves to the highest standards in their safekeeping and use.</p>
<p>
<b>This means, most importantly, that we do not sell client or prospective client information—whether it is your personal information or the fact that you are or may become a Vanguard client—to anyone.</b>
</p>
<p>Instead, we use your information primarily to complete transactions that you request or to make you aware of other financial products and services that we offer or sponsor.</p>
<p>
<b>The personal information we collect about you</b>
</p>
<p>You provide personal information when you complete a Vanguard account application.
(If you enter information in an online application, we may store the information even if you don’t complete or submit the application.) You also provide personal information when you request literature or a transaction that involves Vanguard or one of the Vanguard-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>In addition to personal information you provide to us, we may receive information about you that you authorize third parties to provide to us.
We also may obtain personal information from third party service providers in order to verify your identity, to prevent fraud, or to help us identify products and services that may benefit you.</p>
<p>Personal information collected from any source may include, among other things, your name and address, Social Security or taxpayer identification number, date of birth, assets, income, account balances, investment activity, and accounts at other institutions.
The information we collect about you may be transferred to or stored by Vanguard in the United States or elsewhere, as permitted by law.</p>
<p>
<b>How we handle your personal information</b>
</p>
<p>We do not sell information about current or former clients or their accounts to third parties.
Nor do we share personal information about clients or prospective clients, except when needed to complete transactions at your request or to make you aware of related financial products and services that we offer.
Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to complete certain transactions or account changes that you direct, it may be necessary to provide identifying information about you to companies, individuals, or groups that are not affiliated with Vanguard.
For example, if you ask to transfer assets from another financial institution to Vanguard, we will need to provide certain information about you to that company to complete the transaction.</li>
<li>In order to alert you to other financial products and services that Vanguard offers or sponsors, we may share your information within the Vanguard family of affiliated companies, to the extent permitted by law.
This would include, for example, sharing your information within Vanguard to make you aware of new Vanguard funds or other investment offerings, or the brokerage services offered through Vanguard’s brokerage companies, or the asset management and trust services offered through Vanguard’s trust companies and registered investment advisors inside Vanguard.</li>
<li>In certain instances, we may contract with nonaffiliated companies to perform services for us.
Where necessary, we will disclose information we have about you to these third parties.
In all such cases, we provide the third party with only the information necessary to carry out its assigned responsibilities, and only for that purpose.
And we require these third parties to treat your private information with the same high degree of confidentiality that we do.</li>
<li>Finally, we will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are compelled by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to prevent fraud).</li>
</ul>
<p>
