<strong>Privacy &amp.
Security Policy</strong>
<br> The Buckle, Inc.
("Buckle") cares about the privacy of our Guests.
Our goal is to provide the best shopping experience possible for our Guests, and we strive to achieve that goal through our Internet shopping experience.
Buckle.com collects client information to enhance your shopping experience.</p>
<p>
<strong>General Browsing </strong>
<br> Buckle.com gathers navigational information about where our visitors go on our web site and information about the technical efficiencies of our web site and services (i.e.
time to connect to our web site, time to download pages).
This information allows us to see which areas of Buckle.com are most visited and helps us to better understand our Guests' experience at Buckle.com.
This helps us to improve the quality of our visitors' online shopping experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer.
In the process of gathering navigational information, certain information (i.e.
domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding a visitor's use of our web site (such as the time of a visitor's last visit to a page on our web site).</p>
<p>If you cancel an order or do not complete an order, we may collect and use any email address or other information that you have entered as we would collect and use it if you had completed an order.
For example, if you shop Buckle.com and leave the site without completing your order, we may follow up through email with a reminder.</p>
<p>
<strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information </strong>
<br> We collect information from you, which you provide to us at this web site, including but not limited to when you establish or update an account, enter a sweepstakes, participate in a survey, shop online or create or send a wish list.

<strong>Questions or Changes in Policy</strong>
<br> If you have questions or concerns with respect to our Privacy &amp.

<p>Should there be a material change in the categories of information collected at Buckle.com or a material change in how we use information collected at Buckle.com (whether a deletion or addition), for a thirty day period after the change we will note deletions with a strike-out and additions in italic type.
Further, for this same period we will note [Revised] at the end of the revised sentence or sentences and update the effective date at the bottom of the Privacy &amp.
Security Policy.
If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit our site often for this and other important announcements about Buckle.com.</p>
<p>
<strong>Security Statement</strong>
<br> We have made every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the use of a secure server.
With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the card must be the one who places the order.
The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption for securing communications and transactions across the Internet.
The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications "pip" between the purchaser and our web entity.
Data transmitted over an SSL connection is designed to prevent tampering without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering.
A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window identifies the security mode of a browser.
When the browser is running in "normal" mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open.
Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is in "secure" mode.
SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption.
In addition, it is our policy not to send your credit card number via email.
In fact, this is a practice we recommend you adopt in all of your internet activities.</p>
<p>While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.</p>
<p>
<b>This Privacy &amp.
Security Policy supersedes all prior policies and is effective June 13, 2016.</b>
