<u>Choices You Have</u>
</b>
</p>
<p>You have the following options when it comes to how your information is used by Buckle: </p>
<ul>
<li>Joining Buckle’s email list allows you to receive exclusive information about special offers, media events, new products and much more.
If you’re not already registered, simply complete our <i>
<u>sign-up form</u>
</i> to receive these special messages.
You may also opt-in to our email database in-store at the cash register.
Those names are electronically added in batch to our email database weekly.
If you have opted-out of our email database in the past but have more recently opted back into our email database through the store register, we will renew your subscription at that time.
If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of Buckle’s email messages, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each email message.
This will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at Buckle.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products or other operational email communications.</li>
<li>If you prefer not to receive prescreened credit offers from Buckle and other companies, you may call 1-888-5-OPTOUT or visit <i>
<u>www.optoutprescreen.com</u>
</i> to limit access to your credit report information.
According to the FTC, requests to opt out are processed within five days, but it may take up to 60 days before you stop receiving prescreened offers.
If you later change your mind, you may use the same toll-free telephone number or website to opt back in.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>
