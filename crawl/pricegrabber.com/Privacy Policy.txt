<strong> PRIVACY POLICY </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At PriceGrabber.com Inc.
("PriceGrabber") we want you to know exactly how and when we collect and use information that can specifically identify you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address ("personal information").
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> We do not require that you provide, nor do we collect, any personal information if you are just browsing the Site.
We may offer on the Site non-transactional and transaction based services ("Service(s)") in which, subject to applicable terms and availability, you may participate (e.g., submitting product reviews).
In order to provide you with the Services you request, PriceGrabber may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably necessary in order for us to fulfill your request.
If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information.
Any personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement, the PriceGrabber Terms of Use and your applicable Member Agreement with PriceGrabber, and as may otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected.
To update, modify or delete any personal information you provide to us with respect to a Service you may access your account with PriceGrabber, make the changes on http://www.pricegrabber.com/account.php/settings/ and submit the same to PriceGrabber.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> PriceGrabber will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless: 1) it is necessary in order to provide you with a particular Service you have requested.
2) it is required of PriceGrabber in order to comply with a legal process in any applicable jurisdiction (e.g., court order, subpoena, search warrant, law enforcement request).
3) PriceGrabber determines, in its sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of PriceGrabber, its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-brand partners or other parties under contract with PriceGrabber, our users, or others.
or 4) you have provided such data through a partner's private-level shopping web site hosted by PriceGrabber, in which case PriceGrabber may provide your personal data to that partner (PriceGrabber is not responsible for its partners' privacy policies or their use, storage and processing of data collected on their web sites).
In addition, PriceGrabber may transmit information to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the applicable product(s)/service(s).
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In certain instances, PriceGrabber may request that you provide secondary information (e.g., demographic information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our services.
Any requests for secondary information will be marked "optional" (or its equivalent).
We may compile your personal information with that collected from other customers to create aggregate data.
Aggregate data is information about groups of customers and, once compiled, will in no way identify you as an individual.
We may disclose aggregate data to our business affiliates, advertisers, and other parties.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our web servers collect from Site visitor's statistical information regarding what pages are visited, the date and time of the visits, how long it took a user to download a page, and the TCP/IP address of the user.
These automated server functions do not collect this information in a manner intended to identify your individual use of the Site, nor do we use this information for any such purpose.
This information is collected to assist us in maintaining a high quality site, as well as, providing necessary traffic information to our advertisers.
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.
We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.

By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
