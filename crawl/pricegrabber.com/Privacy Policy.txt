g.
, submitting product reviews or becoming a Member to buy or sell items through the Storefronts Service).
In order to provide you with the Services you request, PriceGrabber may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably necessary in order for us to fulfill your request.
If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information.
Any personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement, the PriceGrabber Terms of Use and your applicable Member Agreement with PriceGrabber, and as may otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected.

In addition, PriceGrabber may transmit information to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the applicable product(s)/service(s).
  In certain instances, PriceGrabber may request that you provide secondary information (e.
g.
, demographic information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our services.
