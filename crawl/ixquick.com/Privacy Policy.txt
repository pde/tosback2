PRIVACY Privacy Policy <br>In short: Ixquick does NOT collect or share ANY personal information! <p> The longer version: <br>
Ixquick is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community.<br>
<br>This privacy policy details the - very limited - information Ixquick.com ("Ixquick") may gather and our disclosure policy.
</p> IP Addresses
<p>The IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded.<br>(The only exception is for abusive (automated) queriers that rapidly submit many queries to Ixquick in a very short time.)</p>
Data Collection
<p>
<i>We don't collect any personal information on our visitors.
Nada.
Zilch.
Zero.</i>
<br>
<br>When you use Ixquick, we do not record your IP address, we do not record which browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.), we do not record your computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), and we do not record your search words or phrases.
In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and those overall traffic numbers broken down by language.<br>
<br>Our zero data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to uniquely identify your computer, your location, or you.
It is also important not to record search terms, since they can convey personal information as well.
(Think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number.)</p>
Cookies
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites.
Ixquick uses only one anonymous cookie called "preferences".
This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit.

You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing.
If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.To promote a cookie-free internet, Ixquick has recently launched a URL generator which eradicates the need for setting a cookie.
