<p>Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, along with (i) Go Daddy’s Universal Terms of Service Agreement, and (ii) any plan limits, product disclaimers or other restrictions presented to you on the Domain Name Registration Services landing page of the Go Daddy website (this “Site”), both (i) and (ii) of which are incorporated herein by reference.   </p>
<p>The terms "we", "us" or "our" shall refer to Go Daddy.  The terms "you", "your", "User" or "customer" shall refer to any individual or entity who accepts this Agreement.  Unless otherwise specified, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) Go Daddy, in its sole and absolute discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site, and (ii) your use of this Site or the Services found at this Site after such changes or modifications have been made (as indicated by the “Last Revised” date at the top of this page) shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as last revised.  If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) this Site or the Services found at this Site.  In addition, Go Daddy may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications to this Agreement by email.  It is therefore very important that you keep your shopper account (“Shopper Account”) information, including your email address, current.  Go Daddy assumes no liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that Go Daddy may modify this Agreement in order to comply with its agreement with ICANN, as well as any other terms and conditions set forth by (i) ICANN and/or (ii) the registry applicable to the top level domain ("TLD") or country code top level domain ("ccTLD") in question.

fees and payments</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(a) general terms, including automatic renewal terms</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees (including any registration fees required by ICANN) due for Services purchased at this Site at the time you order the Services.  All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.  Go Daddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. </p>
<p>Where refunds are issued, Go Daddy's issuance of a refund receipt is confirmation that Go Daddy has submitted your refund to the Payment Method (as defined below) charged at the time of the original sale.  You acknowledge and agree that the associated payment provider and/or individual issuing bank establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund.  Refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle.</p>
<p>You may pay for Services by providing a valid credit card, an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), PayPal (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), Alipay (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), or by using Go Daddy's "Good As Gold Prepaid Services" to establish a cash reserve for charge by Go Daddy (each, a "Payment Method").  For Services that offer "Express Checkout", clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Shopper Account.  Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Shopper Account.
Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Shopper Account.</p>
<p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month. </p>
<p>In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option.  The automatic renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the original service period.  For example, if your original service period is for one year, your renewal period will be for one year.  While the details of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the default setting.  Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Go Daddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy at Go Daddy's then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.  In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager ("Account Manager") from this Site and follow the steps found here.  You may enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time.  However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</p>
<p>In addition, Go Daddy may participate in "recurring billing programs" or "account updater services" supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank's participation).  If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.  In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, Go Daddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf.
Go Daddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information.
You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.  Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</p>
<p>If for any reason Go Daddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Go Daddy is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.
If you pay by credit card and if for any reason Go Daddy is unable to charge your credit card with the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Go Daddy is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card you provided, you agree that Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.
You agree that the remedies Go Daddy may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to you of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf.
Go Daddy reserves the right to charge you reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks Go Daddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Go Daddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Go Daddy in its sole and absolute discretion).
Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention, fees incurred by third-party payment providers such as PayPal, Alipay, and Certegy (as defined in the Universal Terms of Service Agreement), fees incurred as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank, or a Payment Method processor, and disputes that require accounting or legal services.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy. </p>
<p>Go Daddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies.
however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S.
dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("Supported Currency" or "Supported Currencies").
If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment.
If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S.
dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase.
In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank.  In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and Go Daddy makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing).
In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Universal Terms of Service Agreement for further details regarding the individual Payment Methods referenced above.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>(b) domain name renewal terms</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you register a domain name, you will have three renewal options: (i) "Automatic Renewal", (ii) "Extended Automatic Renewal", and (iii) "Manual Renewal": </p>
<ol>
<li>
Automatic Renewal.  Automatic Renewal is the default setting.
Therefore, unless you select either Extended Automatic Renewal or Manual Renewal, Go Daddy will enroll you in the Automatic Renewal plan.  If you enroll in the Automatic Renewal plan, Go Daddy will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy, at Go Daddy's then current rates.
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, Go Daddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, Go Daddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.</li>
<li>
Extended Automatic Renewal.  If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, Go Daddy will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.  Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, Go Daddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, Go Daddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.  Go Daddy will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy, at Go Daddy's then current one-year domain name registration rate.</li>
<li>
Manual Renewal.  If you do not select that the domain name be automatically renewed (through either Automatic Renewal or Extended Automatic Renewal), you have the responsibility of logging into the Domain Manager portion of your Account Manager for that domain name and manually implementing the renewal by the expiration date (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Domain name renewals will be non-refundable.
If for any reason Go Daddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.
It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.</p>
<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), you must renew no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
For some ccTLDs (.es) you must renew no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.  When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling Go Daddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed.
You cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager.
If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>
<p>You agree that Go Daddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew, either automatically or manually in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement.
In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.
If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.  <strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that Go Daddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf.
If Go Daddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse Go Daddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.
The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name.
If you do not reimburse Go Daddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you will have a 30-day redemption period during which you may pay Go Daddy a Redemption fee and redeem your domain name.
The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period Go Daddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.  During the redemption period your domain name may be parked. </p>
<p>If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay Go Daddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name.
The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
<p>Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.
Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.
In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>

<strong>
<em>(C) FREE PRODUCT terms</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
</em>
</strong>In the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is deleted or cancelled.  For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.  In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then Go Daddy may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.  Failed registrations associated with promotionals offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in Go Daddy's sole discretion.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through Go Daddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.</p>
<p>You further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.  If Go Daddy determines (which determination shall be made by Go Daddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then Go Daddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.
Go Daddy will not charge you a fee if Go Daddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.
The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.</p>
<p>You agree that Go Daddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from Go Daddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on Go Daddy's website or contained in Go Daddy's promotional materials.</p>

<p>Choosing Your Domain Name Settings.  When you register a domain name with Go Daddy, you will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.  If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs, then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your domain name settings.  This will direct your domain name away from Go Daddy’s name servers.  If you are an existing Go Daddy customer and have already set up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the checkout process.
  </p>
<p>Go Daddy’s Default Settings.  If you do not direct your domain name away from Go Daddy’s name servers as described above, Go Daddy will direct your domain name to either (i) an “InstantPage®” or (ii) a “Parked Page” (each a “Default Setting”).  You acknowledge and agree that Go Daddy has the right to select the Default Setting.  Further, you acknowledge and agree that not all Default Settings and product options may be available on all Sites on which this Agreement displays.  Descriptions of the InstantPage Default Setting and the Parked Page Default Setting are set forth below.  If you are selected for the InstantPage Default Setting, you will be presented with the InstantPage Service Agreement in the shopping cart at the conclusion of the checkout process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
InstantPage Default Setting.  Go Daddy’s InstantPage product is an online website builder designed to build a one-page website.  If your domain name is directed to an InstantPage, you acknowledge and agree that one of several stock images and corresponding color palettes will display on your domain name.  All stock images and corresponding color palettes will be randomly selected by Go Daddy, and you will not be permitted to choose the stock image or corresponding color palette, or make other changes to your InstantPage until after you have completed the checkout process.   </li>
<li>
Parked Page Default Setting.  Go Daddy’s Parked Page service is an online domain monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.  If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree that Go Daddy may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links to Go Daddy products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.  In addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising will be selected by Go Daddy and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any compensation in exchange therefor.  Please note that the third-party advertising displayed on Go Daddy’s Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you, including but not limited to links to adult content.  Go Daddy makes no effort to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising displayed on Go Daddy’s Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changing Go Daddy’s Default Settings.  You may change Go Daddy’s Default Settings at any time during the term of your domain name registration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Modifying The Content Displaying On Your InstantPage.  If your domain name is directed to an InstantPage and you wish to modify the content displaying on your InstantPage (such as the stock images and corresponding color palettes), log into the InstantPage application and follow the prompts.  You may also cease using InstantPage by choosing one of the options listed below in paragraphs (iii), (iv) or (v).</li>
<li>
Modifying The Content Displaying On Your Parked Page.  If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page and you wish to modify the content displaying on your Parked Page, please note that there is no way to do this and you must select one of the other options listed below in paragraphs (iii), (iv) or (v).</li>
<li>
Setting Up A Website or “Coming Soon Page”.  If your domain name is directed to an InstantPage or Parked Page and you wish to set up a website or Coming Soon Page, in lieu of your InstantPage or Parked Page (as applicable), use another website builder (either through Go Daddy or a third party), and follow the steps for such website builder.
  </li>
<li>
Participating In Domain Name Monetization.  If you wish to participate in the domain monetization potential presented by Go Daddy’s Parked Page service, please review and consider purchasing either our CashParking® service or Quick Content service.   </li>
<li>
No Content.  If none of the options listed above is acceptable to you and you would prefer that no content display on your domain name, please contact customer support and we will assist you with this task.</li>
</ol>
<p>Return To Parked Page Default Setting Upon Domain Name Expiration.  Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting described above.  As used in this paragraph, “expiration” is deemed to include any “renewal period” or “redemption period” immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned to the registry.  Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section 2(B), Domain Name Renewal Terms, of this Agreement.   </p>
<p>10.
pre-registrations</p>
<p>If you submit an application for pre-registration of a domain name, Go Daddy does not guarantee that the name will be secured for you, or that you will have immediate access to the domain name if secured.  Go Daddy may use third-party service providers for the pre-registration services.</p>

or, (ii) the ordinary course of trade or business.

The Intellectual Property Claim Service is a service introduced by Registry Operator to notify a trademark or service mark holder ("Claimant") that a second level domain name has been registered in which that Claimant claims intellectual property rights.
In accordance with the STOP and its associated Rules, those Claimants will have the right to challenge registrations through independent ICANN-accredited dispute resolution providers.</p>
<p>The UDRP sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between a Registrant and any party other than the Registry Operator or Registrar over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by Registrant.</p>
<p>The RDRP sets forth the terms under which any allegation that a domain name is not used primarily for business or commercial purposes shall be enforced on a case-by-case, fact specific basis by an independent ICANN-accredited dispute provider.
None of the violations of the Restrictions will be enforced directly by or through Registry Operator.
Registry Operator will not review, monitor, or otherwise verify that any particular domain name is being used primarily for business or commercial purposes or that a domain name is being used in compliance with the SUDRP or UDRP processes.</p>
<p>
