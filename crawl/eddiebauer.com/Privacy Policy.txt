We use mobile location analytics technology at our U.S.
retail spaces to gain aggregate insights about customer behavior.
The data collected is anonymous and works by sensing the presence of Wi-Fi enabled devices.
No personal information is collected.
This technology collects and hashes Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from Wi-Fi enabled devices that come in contact with our network equipment.
In addition, this technology collects signal strength, time and date, the manufacturer of the device, and the name of a Wi-Fi network currently connected to the device, if applicable.
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to every mobile device and is not the device's phone number.
Collection of mobile location information only occurs when a device's Wi-Fi setting is turned on.</p> ^Return to top How do you use my information?
