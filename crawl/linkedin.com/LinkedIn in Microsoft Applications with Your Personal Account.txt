LinkedIn in Microsoft Applications with Your Personal Account<p>LinkedIn and Microsoft have made it possible to access your LinkedIn network from within Microsoft apps and services, and use data from your Microsoft account to improve your experience on LinkedIn.
For example, you can now see LinkedIn insights and profiles of many LinkedIn members, or invite others to connect, within applications like Outlook.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> These features will be gradually rolled out to our members and may not be available to everyone at this time.
This information pertains to connecting your LinkedIn account to your <em>Microsoft personal account</em> only.

<p>
<em>What data is included?</em>
</p>
<p>When you connect your LinkedIn and Microsoft personal accounts, you allow LinkedIn to provide the following data to Microsoft to be accessed, stored, and used in accordance with Microsoft's Privacy Statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Profile data</em> - includes your LinkedIn identity, contact information, and the information you share with others on your LinkedIn profile.
</li>
<li>
<em>Interests data</em> - includes your interests on LinkedIn, such as people and topics you follow, learning interests and recommendations, your groups, and content you like and share.
</li>
<li>
<em>Subscriptions data</em> - includes your subscriptions to LinkedIn applications and services.
</li>
<li>
<em>Connections data</em> - includes your LinkedIn network, including profiles and contact information of your 1st-degree connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting your LinkedIn and Microsoft personal accounts also allows Microsoft to provide the following data to be accessed, stored, and used by LinkedIn in accordance with LinkedIn's Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Profile data</em> - includes your Microsoft account information, your photo, and contact information.
</li>
<li>
<em>Calendar data</em> - includes the meetings in your calendars, their times, locations, and attendees.
</li>
<li>
<em>Interests data</em> - includes your interests based on your activities in Microsoft apps such as Cortana and Bing.
</li>
<li>
<em>Subscriptions data</em> - includes your subscriptions to Microsoft applications and services.
</li>
<li>
<em>Contacts data</em> - includes your contact lists in Outlook, Skype, and other Microsoft account services.
Your contacts will be periodically imported, stored, and used by LinkedIn, for example to suggest connections, help you organize your contacts, and show you updates about your contacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>How is your data used?</em>
</p>
<p>The LinkedIn data you share with Microsoft is used to customize the experience within Microsoft apps and services for you and other users.
For example, you can gain insights on things you have in common with others, like that you attended the same school, without having to leave some Microsoft apps or services and go to LinkedIn.
Or, when communicating with a colleague in Outlook, you can easily see if you and that colleague share a common connection on LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>The Microsoft data you share is used to customize the LinkedIn experience.
For example, LinkedIn may suggest that you connect to some of your Microsoft contacts.</p>
<p>
<em>Your control</em>
