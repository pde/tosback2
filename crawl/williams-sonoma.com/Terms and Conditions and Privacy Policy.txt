Arbitration Agreement &amp.
Waiver of Certain Rights
<p>
You and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
You and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim.
All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
relating to these Terms and Conditions or the Web Site or our mobile applications (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules").
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.
The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
</p>
<p>
If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.
In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
</p>
<p>
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
You and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
In addition, you and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms and Conditions, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
Neither you nor Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim.
Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.
The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Williams-Sonoma, Inc.'s individual Claims.
The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
</p>
<p>
If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect.
No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms and Conditions will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.
Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms and Conditions.
This Section of the Terms and Conditions will survive the termination of your relationship with Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
</p>
<p>
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF.
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WILLIAMS-SONOMA, INC.
WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
</p>
Other Provisions
<p>
Any action relating to the use of the Web Site, mobile applications, catalogs or any transaction with Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
must be brought in the state or federal courts located in the County of San Francisco, California.
You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.

<p>
These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.
</p>
<p>
Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
</p>
<p>
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.
</p>
<p>
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a web site.
A session cookie expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service when you visit our web site and other web sites of interest to you.
We also use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products, services and advertising to suit the personal interests of you and others, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at our web sites and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns.</p>

In addition, we or certain of our Service Providers, in connection with the services that they provide to us, may work with third parties who may use cookies to collect information to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Internet and on our web sites, and to assist in reminding us of who you are.
If you would like to opt out of accepting cookies altogether, you can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

Security
<p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.

SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.
Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.
Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.</p>
