<br>As an Etsy member you are required to provide a valid email address at registration and choose a username or alias that may represent your identity on Etsy.<br>
<br>Depending on which services you choose to use, Etsy may require additional information, such as a shop name, billing and payment information (including billing address, telephone number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or a physical mailing address.
As a shop owner if you choose to enable direct checkout, Etsy may require information such as your social security number or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information, credit card information and/or other proof of identification in order to verify your identity and provide this service to you.
Credit card information on an account may be stored and used for both billing and payment purposes.
Etsy may contact individual shop owners to confidentially request more information about their shops or items listed on the site, to ensure compliance with our rules.
