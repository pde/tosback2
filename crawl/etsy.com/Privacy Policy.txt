Depending on which services you choose to use, Etsy may require additional information, such as a shop name, billing information (including billing address, phone number, credit card information), a mobile telephone number, a physical mailing address, and/or payment information.
As a shop owner if you choose to enable direct checkout, Etsy may require information such as your social security number or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information in order to verify your identity and provide this service to you.
You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to be publicly displayed in connection to your account and activity.
