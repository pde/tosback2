</ul> NIH Web Privacy Notice <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us.
Our Web site links to other National Institutes of Health (NIH) sites, federal agency sites and occasionally, to private organizations.
Once you leave the primary NIH.gov site, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting.
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit to NIH Web sites unless you choose to provide it to us.
We do, however, collect some data about your visit to our Web site to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful.
We collect information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our Web site.
NIH never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to the NIH mission and goals.</p>
<p>When visitors send email messages containing personal information to the general NIH.gov email box NIHinfo@od.nih.gov, NIH staff responds to the letters and files them.
Only designated staff members requiring access to the emails to respond, may view, or answer them.</p> Types of Information Collected <p>When you browse through any Web site, certain information about your visit can be collected.
We automatically collect and temporarily store the following type of information about your visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain from which you access the Internet;</li>
<li>IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the Web);</li>
<li>Operating system and information about the browser used when visiting the site;</li>
<li>Date and time of your visit;</li>
<li>Pages you visited.
and,</li>
<li>Address of the Web site that connected you to an NIH Web site (such as google.com or bing.com).</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and to help make our site more useful to visitors.</p> Up to top
<br>How NIH Collects Information <p>NIH Web sites use a variety of different Web measurement software tools.</p>
<p> NIH.gov uses Webtrends and Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information in the bulleted list in the <em>Types of Information Collected</em> section above.
Webtrends and Google Analytics collect information automatically and continuously.
No personally identifiable information is collected.
The NIH staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Webtrends and Google Analytics.
The reports are only available to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p> NIH also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors.
NIH.gov uses the ForeSee Results’ American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with the NIH.gov Web site.
This survey does not collect personally identifiable information.
Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors, it is optional.
If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources at the NIH.gov site as those who do not take the survey.
The survey reports are available only to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p>NIH retains the data from Webtrends, Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results as long as needed to support the mission of the NIH.gov Web site.</p> Up to top
<br>How NIH Uses Cookies <p>The Office of Management and Budget Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.</p>
<p>When you visit any Web site, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer.
The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected.</p>
<p>The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages.
Cookies from NIH Web pages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site.
they do not collect personal information about you.
</p>
<p>There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent).
Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open.
Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site.
These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site.
The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies." </p>
<p>
<strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> We use persistent cookies to enable Webtrends and Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning NIH.gov visitors.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to NIH.gov until they expire.
We also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey.
The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days.
The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2—Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."</p> Up to top
<br>How to Opt Out or Disable Cookies <p>If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your Web browser.

<br>Data Safeguarding and Privacy <p> NIH uses web measurement and customization technologies to help our Web sites function better for visitors and to better understand how the public uses the online resources we provide.
All uses of web-based technologies comply with existing policies with respect to privacy and data safeguarding standards.
Information Technology (IT) systems owned and operated by NIH are assessed using Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) posted for public view on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Web site (http://www.hhs.gov/pia/nih.html ).
NIH conducts and publishes a PIA for each use of a third-party website and application (TPWA) as they may have a different functionality or practice.
TPWA PIAs are posted for public view on DHHS Web site http://www.hhs.gov/pia/nih_pia_summaries_fy12_q2.pdf .</p>
<p> Groups of records that contain information about an individual and are designed to be retrieved by the individual’s name or other personal identifier linked to the individual are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C.
Section 552a).
For these records, NIH Systems of Record Notices are published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and posted on the NIH Senior Official for Privacy Website.
When you visit the NIH Institute/Center sites, please look for the Privacy Notice posted on the main pages.
When web measurement and customization technologies are used, the Privacy Policy/Notice must provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose of the web measurement and/or customization technology.
</li>
<li>Usage tier, session type, and technology used.
</li>
<li>Nature of the information collected.
</li>
<li>Purpose and use of the information.
</li>
<li>Whether and to whom the information will be disclosed.
</li>
<li>Privacy safeguards applied to the information.
</li>
<li>Data retention policy for the information.
</li>
<li>Whether the technology is enabled by default or not and why.
</li>
<li>How to opt-out of the web measurement/customization technology.
</li>
<li>Statement that opting-out still permits users to access comparable information or services.
and, </li>
<li>Identities of all third-party vendors involved in the measurement and customization process.
</li>
</ul>Up to top
<br>Data Retention and Access Limits <p> NIH will retain data collected using the following technologies long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected.
The data generated from these activities falls under the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule (GRS) 20-item IC 'Electronic Records,' and will be handled per the requirements of that schedule (http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs20.html ).</p> Up to top
<br> How NIH.gov uses Third-Party Web sites and Applications <p> As part of the OMB Memo <em>M-10-06, Open Government Directive</em> , the NIH uses a variety of new technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with citizens.
These sites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities and more.
TPWAs are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by NIH, such as applications not hosted on a .gov domain or those that are embedded on NIH Web pages.
Users of TPWAs often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the Web site.
These actors may use this information in a variety of ways.
TPWAs could cause PII to become available or accessible to NIH and the public, regardless of whether the information is explicitly solicited or collected by NIH.
</p>
<p> The following list includes some of the TPWAs we use and their purpose.
NIH sometimes collects and uses PII made available through third-party Web sites.
However, we do not share PII made available through third-party Web sites.
Your activity on the third-party Web sites we use is governed by the security and privacy policy of those sites, which we have linked below.
You should review the third-party privacy policies before using the sites and ensure that you understand how your information may be used.
If you have an account with a third-party Web site, and choose to follow, like, friend, or comment, certain PII associated with your account may be made available to NIH based on the privacy policy of the third-party Web site and your privacy settings within that third-party Web site.
Therefore, you should also adjust privacy settings on your account to match your preferences.
</p>
<p> For any NIH TPWA that collects PII, the list below also includes details on the information NIH collects and how we will protect your private information.
</p> Up to top
<br> Third-Party Web Sites and Applications <p>
<strong>
<em>AddThis</em>:</strong> NIH uses the <em>AddThis</em> service to allow you to bookmark and share the <em>News in Health</em> Web site content on a variety of social media sites.
If you use the <em>AddThis</em> service to share content, you do not need to register or provide any personal information.
<em>AddThis</em> collects non-personal data, including the aggregate and summary statistics on browsers and usage patterns.
<em>AddThis</em> also uses non-personal data to manage the service efficiently and diagnose server problems.
Although <em>AddThi</em>s offers some analytics and usage data to NIH, these reports do not include any PII.
The reports are password-protected and only available to NIH Managers, System Owners, Communications Staff, Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

<strong>
<em>Bit.ly</em>:</strong> NIH uses <em>Bit.ly</em> to shorten long URLs for use in email messages, <em>Twitter</em> feeds and on <em>Facebook</em> pages.
<em>Bit.ly</em> collects and provides data on how often you as an email recipient or <em>Facebook/Twitter</em> user, click on the shortened URLs distributed by NIH staff.
<em>Bit.ly </em>analytics show how many people clicked on the URLs posted by NIH, compared to the total number of clicks on the shortened URLs.
<em>Bit.ly</em> analytics do not provide any PII about the visitors who open the shortened links.
The <em>Bit.ly</em> Privacy Policy is available at http://bit.ly/pages/privacy </p> Up to top

<strong>
<em>Facebook</em>:</strong> NIH has three main <em>Facebook </em>pages—<em>National Institutes of Health (NIH) , NIH Research Matters </em>, and <em>News in Health</em> .
Many other NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) sponsor their own <em>Facebook</em> pages.
IC<em> Facebook</em> Privacy Policies are located on the individual IC web sites, which can found by clicking on the respective IC from the NIH homepage (http://www.nih.gov/).
NIH <em>Facebook</em> pages are managed by NIH staff members who post news and other items of interest to be consumed by the public.
If you have a <em>Facebook</em> account, you can log in to your account to post comments, and 'like' NIH<em> Facebook</em> pages and individual entries.
If once you click on an NIH <em>Facebook </em>page, you comment or click on the 'like' button, your PII will be visible to NIH staff and other <em>Facebook</em> site visitors.
The amount of visible personal information displayed will depend on your own <em>Facebook</em> privacy settings.
You can completely avoid displaying any PII by not creating a <em>Facebook</em> account, not posting comments, not clicking on the 'like' options, or interacting with NIH<em> Facebook</em> accounts in any way (i.e., private messaging, sharing NIH posts, etc.).
NIH staff do not collect, use or disclose any information about visitors who comment or 'like' the NIH<em> Facebook</em> sites.
However, as a practice, comment moderator policy requires the removal from NIH <em>Facebook</em> pages of any comments that contain spam or are improper, inflammatory, or offensive.
The information is then saved on a password-protected shared drive accessible to NIH Managers, System Owners, Communications Staff, Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

Photos posted may also include pre-approved photos of NIH employees at events or in labs for the purpose of promoting the NIH mission and culture.
You do not need to register with <em>Flickr</em> to view the images onNIH <em>Flickr</em> sites, because all NIH images posted on <em>Flickr</em> are visible in the public domain.
However, if you choose to register, you will not provide PII directly to NIH.
NIH has disabled the commenting feature on its <em>Flickr</em> sites.
Therefore, PII cannot be collected or unintentionally received by NIH employees via the <em>Flickr</em> site.
The <em>Flickr</em> Privacy Policy is available at http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/flickr/details.html </p> Up to top
<br>

<strong>
<em>Polldaddy</em>: </strong>NIH uses <em>Polldaddy</em> in conjunction with some NIH WordPress blogs to collect your click-opinions or rankings of drop-down menu preferences as a blog participant.
<em>Polldaddy</em> is the only survey tool that is compatible with WordPress and most <em>Polldaddy</em> surveys are embedded within blog entries on NIH WordPress blogs.
However, there are links to the <em>Polldaddy</em> site at the bottom of the survey form.
You can vote on a topic using the <em>Polldaddy</em> form embedded on a NIH blog.
However, to submit a comment, you must navigate directly to the <em>Polldaddy</em> site, provide your name, and e-mail address.
<em>Polldaddy</em> automatically scans your comments prior to posting them to determine whether they are spam and, if so, deletes them.
If the submission is not recognized as spam by the <em>Polldaddy</em> filtering program, the comment is immediately posted to the poll results published on the <em>Polldaddy</em> site.
Considering the comments provided could potentially contain PII, any such unsolicited PII will not be posted on NIH blogs.
Any information collected by NIH is de-identified and will be used solely for the purpose of engaging participants and gaining insight into public opinions.
Comments will be viewable on the <em>Polldaddy</em> site.
The <em>Polldaddy</em> Privacy Policy is available at http://polldaddy.com/privacy/ </p> Up to top
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Twitter</em>:</strong> NIH uses <em>Twitter</em> to send short messages or ‘Tweets’ (up to 140 characters) to share information about NIH with you and respond to your comments and inquiries sent via <em>Twitte</em>r to NIH.
While you may read the NIH <em>Twitter</em> feeds without subscribing to them, if you want to subscribe to (or follow) NIH <em>Twitter</em> feeds, you must create a <em>Twitter</em> account at www.twitter.com.
To create an account, you must provide some personal information, such as your name, user name, password and email address.
You have the option to provide additional personal information including a short biography, location or a picture.
Most information you provide for a <em>Twitter</em> account is available to the public, but you can modify how much of your information is visible by changing your privacy settings at the <em>Twitter</em>.com Web site.
NIH staff members monitor the number of subscribers and respond to comments and queries via <em>Twitte</em>r, but the staff never takes possession of the personal information belonging to you as a <em>Twitte</em>r follower.
However, as a practice, comment moderator policy requires the removal from the NIH <em>Twitter</em> pages of any comments that contain spam or are improper, inflammatory, or offensive.
The information is then saved on a password-protected shared drive accessible to NIH Managers, System Owners, Communications Staff, Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

<strong>
<em>Widgets</em>:</strong> NIH offers a variety of widgets that deliver small versions of selected NIH site content to other online locations outside of the site where the content originated.
Widgets are portable pieces of code.
They deliver information and links to any site or application where the widget is installed.
You can install a widget on any PC or Mac Web page without requiring additional coding or configuration.
If you choose to install NIH.gov widgets, they will not collect any type of PII from you.
The WidgetBox Privacy Policy is available at http://www.widgetbox.com/info/legal/privacy-policy Note: This is the privacy policy for the widget creator program, not the widgets themselves.</p> Up to top

<strong>
<em>YouTube</em>:</strong> NIH posts videos on <em>YouTube</em> to make them available to the public.
You do not need to register with either <em>YouTube</em> or Google (<em>YouTube</em> Owner) to watch NIH<em> YouTube</em> videos.
When you watch videos, <em>YouTube</em> may record non-personally identifiable information about their site usage, such as channels used, videos watched, and data transfer details to improve its services.
If you log on to the <em>YouTube</em> site before watching NIH videos, <em>YouTube</em> may associate information about your site usage with your <em>YouTube</em> account.
