Please note that information that you voluntarily make public in your user profile, or which you disclose on forums, discussions boards or by posting comments will be publicly available and viewable by others.</p>
<p>We may access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your private content (such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails or file transfers), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.
protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud our users, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
operate and maintain the security of our websites, products and services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
or protect our rights or property including enforcing the terms governing the use of our websites, products or services – however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our products to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Skype or Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer’s private communications or documents ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.</p>
<p>In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with Skype’s group companies, carriers, partner service providers and/or agents.
For example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, WiFi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services.
Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>Some Skype products may be (i) co-branded.
(ii) made available via a partner company’s website.
and/or (iii) supported through a partner company.
If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype’s and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the product and you understand that the partner company’s use of your personal data may be subject to the partner company’s privacy policy.
Skype may offer its products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/services or additional services and benefits.
To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the Skype Manager, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by your Skype Manager Administrator if you have agreed to such access.
You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on www.skype.com.
If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included in the Skype Manager directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of the Skype Manager.</p>
<p>Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information.
Skype may provide reasonable assistance and information to fulfill such request and you hereby consent to such disclosure.</p>
<p>Information that is collected by or sent to Skype and/or Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.
In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country.
By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

<p>As Microsoft continues to develop its business, Microsoft might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units.
In any such transactions in which Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets.
We reserve the right to include your personal information in any such transfer to a third party.</p>

<b>4.4.2 Advertising</b>
<p>The advertisements of Skype and of third parties appearing in the Skype software, Skype products and on third party websites are delivered to you by Microsoft Advertising or other carefully selected ad serving partners (“Ad Serving Partners”).</p>
<p>Skype and its Ad Serving Partners may use non-personally identifiable information that you have provided in your Skype profile or otherwise provided to Skype, such as your age, gender, language and country of residence, as well as information about your relationship with and use of Skype’s websites, software, and products, in order to provide advertisements likely to be of greater interest to you and to help us measure and improve the performance of our advertising campaigns.
Skype and our Ad Serving Partners may use cookies and/or web-beacons (Gifs) to collect this information.<br>
</p>
<b>4.4.3.

<p>Skype’s affiliate network program partner allows third parties to introduce people to Skype.
Our affiliates may send cookies to your computer to allow them to receive information (a) when you click on a Skype related link on one of our affiliate partner sites, and/or (b) when you make a purchase on Skype’s website, for the purpose of paying commission to the affiliate partner.
If you re-visit Skype’s site directly, our affiliate network program partner can recognize you and reward the third-party affiliate partner site that referred you to our site.

<b>4.5 Your Choices about Cookies</b>
<p>We don’t recommend that you restrict or block cookies as this may impact on the functionality of our websites and products.
However, if you choose to do so, please see the options available to you below.
You can also find comprehensive information about cookies at www.aboutcookies.org.</p>
<b>4.5.1 Browser Cookies</b>
<p>The Help option on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to delete cookies or how to disable cookies altogether.</p>
<p>Skype software browser cookies can be disabled by: accessing the File menu from your Skype software client toolbar, choosing the Privacy option and un-checking the ‘Allow Skype Browser Cookies’ box.</p>
<b>4.5.2 Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies)</b>
<p>You can manage the usage of flash cookies via http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/.</p>

<b>4.5.4 Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection.</b>
<p>Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.  Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.  We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.
In the meantime, users may continue to opt-out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth below.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers.
When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked.
By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer Privacy Statement or Internet Explorer Help.</p>
<b>5.
YOUR ADVERTISING CHOICES</b>
<p>Skype websites and some Skype software clients enable third-party advertisements provided by Microsoft Advertising and its Ad Serving Partners.
We may use non-personally identifiable information that you have provided to Skype, such as the age, gender, language and country of residence in your Skype profile as well as information about your relationship with and use of Skype’s websites, software, and products, such as the destination of your calls, in order to provide advertisements likely to be of greater interest to you and to help us measure and improve the performance of our advertising campaigns and offers.</p>
<p>These ads may also be targeted based on other information Microsoft Advertising collects outside of Skype’s websites and software.
For instance, Microsoft Advertising may utilize the same browser cookies set by Microsoft websites to enhance targeting within the Skype software client.</p>
<p>
<br>
To learn more about how Microsoft Advertising collects and uses information to target ads on Skype and other properties, including how it uses information collected from Skype, such as age and gender and other information collected as part of delivering ads to or on behalf of Skype to target ads on other properties, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement</p>
<p>If you sign-in to Skype using a Microsoft account or a Skype account that you have linked to a Microsoft account, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by visiting http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759.</p>
<p>You can also opt out of receiving behaviourally-targeted ads from Microsoft and other advertising companies by visiting the following sites:</p>
<p>1.  In the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page</li>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page</li>
</ul>
<p>2.  In Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit Your Online Choices Page</li>
</ul>
<p>3.  In Canada:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC)
</li>
<li>French: Choix de Pub: l’Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, in some versions of the Skype software that enable targeted ads, you may opt-out of Microsoft targeted ads displayed in the software by visiting the privacy options in the software or account settings menu.
If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other targeting information will not be used.</p>
<p>In some instances, Microsoft Advertising may facilitate the placement of advertisements in Skype software client by other online advertising networks.
In some cases, these third parties may also place cookies on your computer and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.
These companies currently include, but are not limited to: 24/7 Real Media, aCerno,Inc, AdBlade, AdConion, AdFusion, Advertising.com, AppNexus, Bane Media, Brand.net, CasaleMedia, Collective Media, Interclick, Millennial, ROI Media, SpecificMedia, Tribal Fusion, ValueClick, Yahoo!, YuMe and Zumobi.
If you have opted-out of targeted ads in the Skype client as outlined above, Skype will not pass any profile information to such advertising providers with the ad request.
However, because these third parties may place cookies on your computer that facilitate their own targeting, the Skype opt-out mechanism described above will not necessarily prevent ad targeting by these companies.
These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies.
You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each company.
Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which each provide a simple way to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies.</p>

MAPPING AND LOCATION FEATURES</b>
<p>If you agree to allow access to your location, Skype can use that information to provide services you request or to personalize your experience.
For example, Skype may contain features that are based on the Bing Maps service or other third party map services that allow you to share your current location on a map or to search for items on a map, such as nearby Wi-Fi access points.
When you request to plot your location on a map or to search for nearby Wi-Fi access points, your request is provided to Bing Maps and/or the third party map service for processing.
Location information may include data available cell tower data, Wi-Fi hotspot data, and Global Position System (GPS) data.</p>
<p>When you use a Skype feature to plot your location using the Bing Maps service, Bing will collect those requests and Location-related information related to the requests may be used for calculating payments to Bing’s data vendors as part of operating the service.
For more information on how Bing collects and uses information, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248686.</p>
<p>To learn more about how third party mapping services collect and use information, see the privacy statements for those services.
Depending on the device you are using, Skype may use third party services to provide mapping services.
For example, Skype may use Google maps on certain devices—you can learn more about the information that Google collects through its mapping services at http://www.google.com/privacy.html</p>
<p>When you use a location based service or feature, available cell tower data, Wi-Fi data and Global Position System (GPS) data may be sent to Microsoft.
Microsoft uses location information to provide the services you request, personalize your experience and improve Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>Certain services may allow you to control when location information is sent to Microsoft or made available to others.
Refer to the documentation that came with your device for information about how to turn off location features.</p>
