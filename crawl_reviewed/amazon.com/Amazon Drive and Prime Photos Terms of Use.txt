<p>
<strong> Amazon Photos Terms of Use</strong>
</p>
<p> This is an agreement between you and Amazon.com Services LLC (together with its affiliates, “Amazon”, “we”, or “us”) regarding the Amazon Photos services and associated software (including any legacy Amazon Drive applications) (the “Services”).
Before using the Services, please read these Terms of Use, all rules and policies related to the Services (including any service plan specific rules, usage restrictions, and other conditions or procedures that we post or update on or through the Services or on Amazon.com), the Amazon.com Privacy Notice and the Amazon.com Conditions of Use posted on Amazon.com (collectively, the “Agreement”).
If you use the Services, you will be bound by the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
The Amazon Photos Services</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1 The Services</strong>.
The Services provide storage, retrieval, management, printing, and access features and functionality for your photos, videos, and other files (“Your Files”).
The Services may provide auto-organization features and functionality, including features and functionality that allow you to sort your photos by the people, objects, and scenes in those photos and the metadata associated with those photos.
When enabled, you agree that the Services may use image recognition technology to group together photos containing people with similar facial characteristics, and to organize and tag your photos.
We retain image recognition data, including data about the faces, in the photos you store using the Services until you disable the image recognition features or your account's access to the Services is terminated.
If your image recognition features are disabled, we will stop storing image recognition data for you, and we will not tag any new photos uploaded to your account.
Image recognition features are enabled automatically when you begin using the Services unless the billing information associated with your account indicates that you may be an Illinois resident, in which case the image recognition features will be disabled and must be enabled by you.
You may enable or disable the Services’ image recognition features through your account settings here.
You can learn more about the Services’ image recognition features in our help content available here.
By using the Services, you are directing us to store, manage, organize, and provide access to Your Files on your behalf.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2 Using Your Files with the Services</strong>.
You may only use the Services to store, retrieve, manage, organize, access, share, and print Your Files for personal, non-commercial purposes using the features and functionality we make available.
You may not use the Services to store, transfer, or distribute content of or on behalf of third parties, to operate your own file storage application or service, to operate a photography business or other commercial service, or to resell any part of the Services.
You are solely responsible for Your Files and for complying with all applicable copyright and other laws, including import and export control laws and regulations, and with the terms of any licenses or agreements to which you are bound.
You must ensure that Your Files are free from any malware, viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, worms, or other malicious or harmful code.</p>
<p>When you create a Family Vault, only you will control whether image recognition features are enabled in the Family Vault.
If you enable image recognition features in your Family Vault, you understand that image recognition analysis will be performed on all of the photos stored by members of the Family Vault.
If you are invited to participate in a Prime member’s Family Vault, the Prime member who invited you will control whether image recognition features are enabled for the Family Vault.
If the image recognition features are enabled for the Family Vault, image recognition analysis will be performed on the photos you store through the Services.</p>
<p>If you are a member of a Group, your image recognition settings will not be affected by your membership of a Group or by the image recognition settings of any other Group member (including the person that enabled the Group).</p>
<p>Turning off the image recognition features for your account does not affect any consent that you may have given to others to the use of image recognition features on photos of you.</p>
<p>The Family Vault, Groups and image recognition features may not be available to all customers.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3 Sharing and Printing Your Files</strong>.
The Services may provide features that allow you to share Your Files with others, and to comment on files that have been shared with you, including through a Family Vault or Group.
Each member of a Family Vault or Group will be able to share Your Files that you choose to contribute to the Family Vault or Group with others, including individuals that are not members of the Family Vault or Group.
By placing Your Files in a Family Vault or Group, you agree to allow such sharing.
The number of users and type of content shareable in each Family Vault or Group may be limited.
The Services may also provide you with features that allow you to submit Your Files for printing by Amazon or our third party contractors.
You may only share or order prints of Your Files in which you have all necessary copyright and other rights.
If you share or print a file, anyone with access to that file may view and download copies of the file.
You are solely responsible for how you share Your Files and who may access Your Files that you share.
You may not share, or order prints of Your Files, whether in electronic or tangible print form, or make comments on files that have been shared with you through the Services (a) that are or that contain defamatory, threatening, abusive, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable material, (b) that advocate bigotry, hatred, or illegal discrimination, or (c) that violates any law, any intellectual property, publicity, privacy, or other right of others, or any license or other agreement by which you are bound.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.4 Third Party Services</strong>.
The Services may allow you to give third party websites, apps, and services (“Third Party Services”) access to Your Files, including the ability to make copies of Your Files, print, modify, or delete Your Files, or create new files on your behalf.
The use and storage of Your Files by Third Party Services will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
Amazon has no responsibility or liability with respect to your use of Third Party Services or the content, functionality, or acts of Third Party Services you use.
You may manage and revoke access for Third Party Services through the settings menu in your account.</p>

<p>
<strong>2.1 Service Plans.
Trial Plans</strong>.
The Services may offer plans with different limits and fees (each a “Service Plan”).
We may also offer trial or promotional Service Plans (“Trial Plans”).
Some Trial Plans automatically convert to a paid Service Plan at its regular price at the end of the trial or promotional period unless you choose not to upgrade.
If you sign up for a Trial Plan that automatically upgrades, we will charge the payment method you provided us at the time you signed up from the Trial Plan (or if that payment method is invalid, another eligible payment method we have on record for you) at the end of the Trial Plan unless you choose to cancel.
