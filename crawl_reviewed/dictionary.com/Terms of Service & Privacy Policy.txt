<li>Cookies and other Trackers.
<ul>
<li>
<b>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</b> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie.
A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors.
Some ad companies and game developers use “flash cookies” for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.
Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
We use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the Services and generally improve your experience.
Ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites that are more relevant to you and your interests.
<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.</li>
<li>Third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.
We use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time.
Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open.
These are deleted automatically once you close your browser.
Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.
They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>
</li>
<li>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES? We use cookies to:
<ul>
<li>track traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with our Services;</li>
<li>understand the total number of visitors to our sites on an ongoing basis and the types of internet browsers (e.g.
Chrome, Safari or Edge), operating systems (e.g.
Windows or Mac OS), and screen resolutions used by our visitors;</li>
<li>monitor and analyze the performance of our Services and to continually improve them;</li>
<li>customize and enhance your online experience.
and</li>
<li>enable Dictionary and third-party advertising both on and off our Sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.
We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you.
We encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<u>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</u> The types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with the Services can be classified into one of the five categories below.
We’ve set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties set in the following table.<br>
<b>TYPE OF COOKIE</b>
<b>WHAT IT DOES</b>
Strictly Necessary Cookies These cookies are essential to operate the Sites and provide the Services by helping us provide basic functionality such as loading and rendering pages on the Sites and enabling your navigation around the Sites and use of certain features.
They are also used to identify and prevent fraud and improve security.
Functionality Cookies
Functionality cookies record information about choices you’ve made and allow us to tailor the Sites to you.
These cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Sites, we can provide you with our Services as you have asked for them to be provided.
For example, these cookies allow us to store language preference.
They may also be used to provide certain functionality such as playing video content.
Performance / Analytics Cookies
We use performance/analytics cookies to analyze how the Sites are accessed, used, or is performing in order to provide you with a better user experience and to maintain, operate and continually improve the Sites.
For example, these cookies allow us to:<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Better understand our website visitors so that we can improve how we present our content;</li>
<li>Test different design ideas for particular pages, such as our homepage;</li>
<li>Collect information about site visitors such as where they are located and what browsers they are using;</li>

and</li>
<li>Conduct research and diagnostics to improve product offerings.</li>
</ul>
Advertising and Tracking Cookies
As you use our Sites, you will notice that it includes advertising.
We allow third party advertising companies to place cookies on our Sites.
These cookies enable such companies to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the web.<br> Cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you’ve seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you’ve last seen it.
This information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.
Social Media Cookies Third parties that make their applications available through/on our Sites may set their own cookies in order to track the performance of their applications or customize those applications for you.
For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.
Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.
Some pages of our website may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.
</li>
<li>
<u>COOKIE CONTROLS.</u> You can control your cookie settings as explained below.
We may disclose your opt-out choices to third parties so that they can honor your preferences in accordance with applicable laws.
<ul>
<li>Web Browser Controls.
Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.
Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones We uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.
These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser.
In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the “Help” option in your browser for more details.</li>
<li>Cookie settings in Microsoft Edge</li>

</ul>
<p>We note that an optional browser setting known as Do Not Track allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash Cookie Controls.
You can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website.</li>
<li>Web-Beacons.
You can usually prevent the operation of web-beacons by changing your web-browser cookie settings and your ad choices, or for those in emails, by switching off images in your email client or viewing emails using only the “text” display (rather than “HTML” display”).
See the “Help” section of your email client for instructions.

<li>CLAIMS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION, CLASS WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
Please read the following important section carefully.
<ul>
<li>Except for small claims disputes or claims related to intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to the Services resolved in court.
Instead, disputes relating in any way to the Services must be submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference.
The arbitrator, not the court, will resolve the issue of arbitrability.
</li>
<li>You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the Services is personal to you and us and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.
</li>
<li>You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
You have the right to an in-person arbitration hearing in your hometown area.
Any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof may enter judgment of any award the arbitrator renders.
</li>
<li>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email to privacy@dictionary.com.
In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.
By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the section, “Governing Law and Forum Selection.”
</li>
<li>If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use.
(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section.
and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
