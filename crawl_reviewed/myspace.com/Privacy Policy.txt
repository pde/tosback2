This Policy applies to the Myspace Services except where a different privacy policy is posted (e.g., the classic service at www.myspace.com and related classic mobile applications), in which case the posted policy applies.
The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States.</p>
<li>Scope Of This Policy</li>
<p>This Policy describes generally how we collect, use, store and share information that we receive from users of Myspace Services ("<strong>Users</strong>").
This Policy applies both to individuals using such services that register with Myspace and create Myspace Accounts and their associated Profile(s) ("<strong>Members</strong>"), as well as individuals who use such Myspace Services without registering ("<strong>Visitors</strong>").</p>
<p>This Policy covers the activities of Myspace with respect to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information through any of the Myspace Services that contain a link to this Policy.
The activities of third parties or VIANT affiliates that provide services (including advertising services) to Myspace, or that you link to from us, or that may collect information about you themselves or that we may share your information with, including our affiliates such as Specific Media LLC ("<strong>Specific Media</strong>"), are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties or VIANT affiliates.</p>
<p>Please note that this Policy does not limit Myspace's use or sharing of aggregated, de-identified or other anonymized information that does not constitute Personal Information (as defined below).
We may use and/or share such information in any manner not otherwise prohibited by this Policy, without notice or compensation to you, including freely disclosing for any legal purpose non-Personal Information to VIANT affiliates, advertisers, partners, content owners, and other third parties.</p>
<p>We will continue to evaluate and update this Policy as we rollout additional services for our Users, employ new technologies and otherwise adapt and improve along with the evolving online and digital world so we recommend that you check for changes regularly.
We welcome your comments, as we strive to maintain a Policy that is both transparent and that improves the Myspace Services.</p>
<p>To the extent that we provide you notice on any of the Myspace Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices <em>(e.g.</em>, at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.</p>
<p>In addition, please review Myspace Services' Terms of Use, which governs your use of Myspace Services.</p>
<li>
The Information That We Collect <ol>
<li> Information You Provide To Us <p>
<strong>Personal Information And Demographic Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with certain information when you interact with the Myspace Services.
This information can generally be grouped into two main categories - Personal Information and Demographic Information.</p>
<p>Information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in this Policy as "<strong>Personal Information</strong>." This would include your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address.
Please note that the term Personal Information does NOT include Myspace IDs or Device Identifiers (as such terms are defined below), except to the extent that they are combined with other forms of Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on the Myspace Services.
The term "<strong>Demographic Information</strong>" refers to information about groups or particular types of individuals that access the Myspace Services.
Demographic Information does not directly identify you as a specific individual, and would include information such as your age, gender, marital status, income level, and zip code.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information and Demographic Information through the Myspace Services when you choose to provide us with such information, for example, when you register to become a Member.
We may also collect Personal Information and/or Demographic Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Registration Information</strong>
<p>Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account ("<strong>Account</strong>").
In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, "<strong>Registration Information</strong>").
Please note that the Registration Information requested by Myspace may include both Personal Information and Demographic Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Profile Content</strong>
<p>When you sign up as a Member, you are required to create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a "<strong>Profile</strong>").
Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content chosen by you, and we may also associate additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, "<strong>Profile Content</strong>").
Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our Terms of Use at all times.
Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information.</p>
<p>The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Restricted Information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"<strong>Restricted Information</strong>" refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to-time here ("<strong>Profile Settings</strong>") or by changing other functionality specific settings on the Myspace Services.
These Profile Settings may permit you to create a "<strong>Restricted Profile</strong>" by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not Public Information, certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities ("<strong>Activity Notifications</strong>").
Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the Profiles that you allow to connect to you.
Please note you are currently unable to restrict access to Public Information, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines.</p>
<p>
<strong>"Public Information"</strong> refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services (<em>e.g.</em>, Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.).
Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy.
At a minimum, Public Information includes your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Name</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Profile URL</li>
<li>About Me (the portion of your Profile that provides a place to describe yourself)</li>
<li>Profile Photo</li>
<li>Profile Cover</li>
<li>Stated Location</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Myspace IDs</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Public Information also includes:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any additional Profile Content associated with a "<strong>Public Profile</strong>," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings, but subject to Mix privacy settings (as further defined).
</li>
<li>Activity Notifications published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;</li>
<li>Your status as a "Top Fan".
</li>
<li>Affinity Information (<em>e.g.</em> the relative magnitude of your affinity for Profiles and content).
and</li>
<li>The number of your connections in and connections out.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public (<em>i.e</em> Public Profiles).
The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted (<em>i.e</em> Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the Terms of Use) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default.
Other than with respect to Artist Profiles, whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting Profile Settings.
Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.</p>
<p>Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public.
Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information.
For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access content pages, which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks (<em>i.e.</em>, "Mixes$quot;).
When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, a Content Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or content, <strong>even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings</strong>.
Content Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone.
In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any content pages that you view.
Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.</p>
<p>The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve.
We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise.
Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate.
If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the Help Site.</p>
<p>The Myspace Services may allow messaging between Members.
More information about who can message whom is available here.</p>
<p>More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available here.</p>
<p>
<strong>Account ID And Profile ID</strong>
</p>
<p>When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an "<strong>Account ID</strong>" to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a "<strong>Profile ID</strong>" for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your "<strong>Myspace IDs</strong>").
The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile ("<strong>Profile URL</strong>").
As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services.
You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings.
</p>

We may also share your media access through Myspace Services (including video viewing and audio content access) as an activity notification by activity notification by, for example, sharing your Profile content (including your full name, username and Profile Picture) on the content page where such video or audio resides.
Additionally, your activity may be indicated on your own Profile (in your activity stream or elsewhere) and on your connections' Profile, in each case, both on the Myspace Website, and on any other Myspace Services, including for example, the Myspace mobile App.
Other examples of activities that may generate Activity Notifications include, but are not limited to: (i) posting status updates.
(ii) commenting on a post.

(viii) adding a photo to a photo album.

An example of an actual Activity Notification on the Myspace Services is the following: "John Doe listened to the song 'True Love Waits'." Activity Notifications may include Profile Content (<em>e.g.</em>, your full name and Profile photo), and some may aggregate your activity with activity of third parties (<em>e.g.</em>, "John Doe and Sally Smith connected to a photo.").</p>
<p>
<strong>Myspace makes this feature public to everyone by default, and anyone can see these Activity Notifications</strong>.
Note that if your Profile is a Restricted Profile, the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will still see your Activity Notifications regarding your content consumption on Myspace.
From time-to-time we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out on a session basis, or a persistent basis, from Activity Notifications related to your content consumption.
For more information, please visit here.
Session settings are intended to last only as long as your Myspace page is open in your browser.
If you close your browser, the session-based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play Activity Notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your Profile's visibility.
<strong>You should always check the content consumption Activity Notification setting each time you use the Myspace Services, so that you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as Activity Notifications.</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use Usage Information (such as about your media consumption, connections to content pages or Profiles, and posts regarding content pages or Profiles), and your Profile Content, to rank affinity to other Profiles and content.
This allows us to identify "<strong>Top Fans</strong>", and we may use your Public Information to display that you are a Top Fan of an artist, other Profile, or a piece of content.
Top Fan status is Public Information – anyone may see your status as a Top Fan.
We also may provide analytics tools to Artist Profiles that allow the owners of such Artist Profiles to see Public Information of Users who strongly engage with the Artist Profile or the content pages controlled by the Artist Profile (e.g., videos or songs or such Artist Profile), including Users that are not connected to the Artist Profile.</p>
<p>
<strong>Unless otherwise noted, your consumption of media on the Myspace Services will be Public Information.</strong>
