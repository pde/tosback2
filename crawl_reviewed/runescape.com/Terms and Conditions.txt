4.
Preteens and users under 18
<p>Jagex Products have age restrictions which prevent users who are under 13 years of age from creating an Account.
You may not create an Account or use the Jagex Product if you are under the age of 13 and it is a violation of our Terms to register an Account on behalf of someone under this age.
Where an applicable age rating body (e.g PEGI, ESRB, ESK) or platform (e.g Apple, Google Play) classifies a particular Jagex Product as suitable to be played only by users of a specified age above 13 years old, then in such circumstances, users (even if Account holders) below this classified age shall not be entitled to play, use or access the particular Jagex Product until they have reached the specified age classification.
In all other circumstances, for users between 13 and 18 years of age, subject to the exceptions set out above and the laws of your country of residence (including the applicable age rating classification allocated to the Jagex Product by the relevant age rating authority and/or platform) and you obtaining your parents’/guardians’ prior consent, you will be entitled to use the Jagex Products.
We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13.
If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will Stop the Account.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using the Jagex Product you are representing (i.e.
making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our Terms.
We may Stop any Account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.
You and your parent(s) or guardian(s) must review these Terms together.
Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Jagex Products.
We recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child.</p>
<p>If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has misrepresented their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the Account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian of that child.</p>
<p>Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us here</p>
5.
Safety and abuse
<p>Before using any Jagex Product you should read the safety information found here.
Parents of those users under the age of 18 should also review this information.</p>
<p>You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content.
User Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate.
We cannot guarantee that users will comply with our Terms, rules or otherwise behave appropriately.
You should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be.
In your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any user outside a Jagex Product.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should report such inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game "Report abuse" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities.
If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Products.
Alternatively, please contact our customer support team here</p>
<p>We are under no obligation to actively monitor and/or moderate User Content.
We do however undertake very limited monitoring detailed below.
</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat Technologies.
We may use anti-cheat technologies in relation to the Jagex Products.
When you connect online to a game server, these technologies may activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the Jagex Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.</p>
<p>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detect cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your Account name, details about the unauthorized third party program and the Jagex Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected.
We also may terminate these Terms, your access to the Jagex Products, and your Jagex Account if we determine you have been cheating.</p>
<p>Chat Monitors
We do not actively monitor chat between users.
We have systems that monitor chat for certain keywords and provide us with a selection of high-risk User Content to review.
</p>
<p>Further we review any chat that contains phrases supplied to us by the Internet Watch Foundation and relate to child protection issues or where a user indicates in chat that they are under 13 years old.</p>
<p>We also review chat logs if we have a reasonable suspicion that a user may be contemplating suicide or harming other users or third parties.
We may supply chat logs to relevant civil and criminal authorities in line with our Privacy Policy.</p>

Your account and license
<p>To use many features of Jagex Products, we require you to create an Account and, in relation to some platform versions of Jagex Products, download and/or, install certain authorised software on your device.
You may be required to create an Account before downloading and installing any software.
We grant valid Account holders a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, personal, limited license, which can be revoked at any time, to access and use the Jagex Products and (as applicable) to download and use our software and install the Jagex Products on a device and to connect to our servers solely to use Jagex Products for personal and non-commercial purposes and subject at all times to your strict compliance with these Terms.
To be clear, we consider the creation of an Account in order to access any authorised software in order to understand, decompile, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, or transmit such authorised software as being outside the scope of “personal and non-commercial use”.
We reserve all other rights, including all right, title and interest in the Jagex Products and associated intellectual property rights.
You may not otherwise use, decompile, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly perform, distribute, commercially exploit, adapt, translate, modify, bundle, merge, share or make available to any person, or create derivative works of the Jagex Product.
Further you may not use any automation tools, macros, bots, auto-typers and tools to circumvent any technical mechanisms or protections in place, share, sell or buy any other Accounts, or participate in any way whatsoever in any real-world trading, use multiple Accounts to break any of these Terms, exploit any known faults or bugs in the Jagex Products or authorised software, impersonate any employee, officer or agent of Jagex, persuade or attempt to persuade (including procuring others to persuade) other users to share any Account information, run or attempt to run any types of games of chance whether in the Jagex Product or in the real world using any part of the Jagex Product (including any Virtual Currencies).
encourage others whether directly or indirectly to break any of these Terms.
use inappropriate language or behaviour including any action that may be considered offensive, racist, obscene, discriminatory.
nor ask for any personal details of other users.
advertise other websites in the Jagex Product or any Jagex authorised forums or social media platforms.
</p>
<p>Except as provided in these Terms, use of the Jagex Product does not grant you any right, title, interest or license to any such intellectual property you may access through the Jagex Products.
Except as provided in these Terms, any use or reproduction of the Jagex Products or intellectual property therein is strictly prohibited.
</p>
<p>THE JAGEX PRODUCTS AND ANY ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE ARE LICENSED TO YOU, NOT SOLD.
YOUR LICENSE CONFERS NO TITLE OR OWNERSHIP TO THE JAGEX PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE.</p>
<p>When setting up an Account for a Jagex Product, you may be asked to choose a username that will be used to identify you to other users.
For example, a Jagex Product character name.
You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified in the applicable rules relating to the Jagex Product.
We reserve the right (at our sole and absolute discretion), to change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.
You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person.
You are fully responsible for all activities on your Account (including the activities of all persons who use your password to gain access to your Account or who use the device on which the Jagex Product or related software is installed and/or downloaded) and for complying with any licences granted in these Terms and for any software.
You are expressly prohibited from allowing anyone else to use your Account or to play or access the Jagex Product on your behalf.
We reserve the right to Stop immediately your Account if someone else uses it.
To help ensure the safety of your password, you must keep your computer and/or device (as applicable) free of viruses and other malicious code including Trojans, worms, time bombs, malware and spyware.
You must use your password in accordance with the password requirements specified in the rules of the Jagex Product.
REAL JAGEX STAFF WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD.
</p>
<p>We do not guarantee Jagex Products will be secure or free from bugs or viruses.
</p>
<p>You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Jagex Product, the server on which the Jagex Product is stored, or any server, computer or database connected to the Jagex Product.
You must not attack the Jagex Products via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack.
By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act (1990).
We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities, and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In the event of such a breach, your right to use and licenses granted in these Terms to the Jagex Product will cease immediately without notice from us.</p>
<p>If you believe that someone has stolen your password or you believe you have lost or had stolen the device upon which the Jagex Product or related software is installed or accessible or you believe that someone other than you has gained access to your Account, you should immediately submit an Account recovery request via the Jagex Product’s main menu.
You will remain responsible for your Account until you have notified us.</p>
