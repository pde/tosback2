<p>Evernote is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it.
However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of information you transmit to us.
accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your data transmission, we make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Evernote password is protected by encryption, and only you have access to it.</li>
<li>Your personal information and data stored in our systems is protected by various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards.
It is housed in a secure facility, and Evernote restricts physical and network access to this facility to select trained staff.
We regularly evaluate our technologies, facilities, procedures and potential risks to maintain the security and privacy of our users’ data.</li>
<li>Certain Evernote services support the use of standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions.
However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other security software failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Evernote learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on our web site.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p> IV.
Information Deletion What Happens If I Want to Stop Using Evernote?
<p>You can delete Content you have posted to any notebook at any time, and you can stop using Evernote at any time.
If you delete information and material from a notebook and then sync your account, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service, but residual copies of your deleted Content may continue to exist on Evernote’s back-up and archiving systems for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
