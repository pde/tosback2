When we collect and use your personal information subject to the EU Privacy Legislation this may have consequences for Your Rights.</p> Sharing of Personal Information <p>As a global organization offering a wide range of products and services, with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders, IBM has implemented global policies, along with standards and procedures, for consistent protection of personal information.
As a global company, we may share information about you with our subsidiaries world-wide and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Between IBM controlled subsidiaries we only grant access to personal information on a need-to-know basis, necessary for the purposes for which such access is granted.
In some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process personal information on its behalf.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, IBM may also share your personal information with selected partners to help us provide you, or the company you work for, products or services, or to fulfill your requests, or with your consent.
When selecting our suppliers and partners, we take into account their data handling processes.</p>
<p>If IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers.
It is IBM's practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.</p>
<p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
We may also share your personal information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p> International Transfers <p>The international footprint of IBM involves a large number of transfers of personal information between different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business.
Some countries have implemented transfer restrictions for personal information, in connection with which IBM takes various measures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where required, IBM implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission, or similar contractual clauses in other jurisdictions.
This includes transfers to suppliers or other third parties.

We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p> Retention Period <p>We will not retain personal information longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, including the security of our processing complying with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g.
audit, accounting and statutory retention terms), handling disputes, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.</p>
