This Policy applies to all Customers and Users.
The Customer who holds the account with AT&amp;T is responsible for making sure all family members or other Users under the same account understand and agree to this Policy.</p>

<p>When is information not covered by this Policy?</p>' + ' <p>Information that you provide to non-AT&amp;T companies is not covered by this Policy.

<p>When you download applications or make an online purchase from a non-AT&amp;T company while using AT&amp;T's Internet or wireless services, the information collected by the non-AT&amp;T company is not subject to this Policy.</p>

Once you choose to reveal Personal Information on such a site, the information is publicly available, and AT&amp;T cannot prevent distribution and use of that information by other parties.</p>

Licensees are subject to AT&amp;T quality control criteria and review procedures, designed to ensure a high standard of product or service performance.
For example, Advanced American Telephones is a Licensee that sells AT&amp;T-branded telephone equipment.
If you provide information to Advanced American Telephones when purchasing an AT&amp;T-branded product, your information will be subject to the privacy policy of Advanced American Telephones, and not this Policy.</p>

<p>What is wireless location information?</p>' + ' <p>The approximate location of your wireless device can be determined using information generated by its communication with near-by cell towers, Wi-Fi receivers and/or with other technologies, including the satellites that compose the Global Positioning System (GPS).
That information is often referred to as your wireless "location information."</p>
</li>' + ' <li>
<p>Do you collect and use my wireless location information?</p>' + ' <p>Yes.

Our use and collection of this information is consistent with the description provided in the "Questions about the Information We Collect, How We Collect It and How We Use It" FAQs.</p>
</li>' + ' <li>
<p>What other types of services use my wireless location information?</p>' + ' <p>You can use your wireless device to obtain a wide array of services based on the approximate location of the device.
These data services (referred to as Location-Based Services or "LBS") are made available by AT&amp;T and other companies via applications that may be pre-loaded on your wireless device, or that you may choose to download from websites or other application stores.
These applications use various technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite or "GPS," Assisted GPS, cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to estimate the physical location of a Customer's mobile device.</p>' + ' <p>Services that allow others to see the approximate location of your wireless device, such as AT&amp;T Family Map and AT&amp;T's fleet locator services for business customers, are examples of LBS, as are navigation services that provide you with directions in response to your request (such as AT&amp;T Navigator), and local search services (such as YP.com and YPmobile.com).</p>' + ' <p>Location information also may be used to enhance your experience of our existing services.
For example, when you dial 411 Directory Assistance for a business phone number, we may use your location information to return the number of the business location closest to you.
Similarly, when you choose certain services on AT&amp;T's MEdia Net portal (for example, "Find Nearest") or download certain applications from the AT&amp;T AppCenter (for example, "Where"), the information provided may be tailored based on what's nearest to the location of your wireless device.</p>' + ' <p>The information you receive in connection with your use of LBS may include advertisements relevant to your request and your location.</p>

For example, your zip-code and street address are types of location information.
We may personalize your wireless, wireline and Wi-Fi Internet service through use of your ZIP code or other location information we may collect through your use of our products and services, and may also use that information for the other purposes described in response to the FAQ "How do we use the information we collect?"</p>
