Because we know your privacy is important, we have a Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use and protect that information.
There’s a quick summary below, and the actual policy is written in an easy to understand “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) format.
We want to simplify this explanation, so you can make informed choices about your privacy, and then spend the rest of your time enjoying our products and services.<br>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of all products, services and websites offered by AT&amp;T and our AT&amp;T affiliates, such as DIRECTV, unless they have a different privacy policy.
Because some apps, including some AT&amp;T and DTV branded apps, require additional information, or use information in different ways, they may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and conditions.
These apps may also offer you additional choices for managing your personal information.</p>
