</p>
Copyright Infringement &amp.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
<p>AT&amp;T respects the intellectual property rights of others.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA" found at 17 U.S.C.
§ 512) provides that owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S.
copyright law have been infringed may report alleged infringements to service providers like AT&amp;T.
In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, AT&amp;T maintains a policy that provides for the termination of IP Services, under appropriate circumstances, if Customers are found to be a repeat infringer and/or if Customers' IP Services are used repeatedly for infringement (the "Repeat Infringer Policy").
AT&amp;T may terminate IP Services at any time with or without notice to Customers.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has no obligation to investigate possible copyright infringements with respect to materials transmitted by Customer or any other users of the IP Services.
However, AT&amp;T will process valid notifications of claimed infringement under the DMCA, and continued receipt of infringement notifications for Customer's account will be used as a factor in determining whether Customer is a repeat infringer.
In addition, AT&amp;T may voluntarily participate, on terms acceptable to AT&amp;T, in copyright alert and graduated response programs.</p>
Incident Reporting
<p>Any complaints (other than claims of copyright infringement) regarding violation of this AUP by an AT&amp;T Customer (or its user) should be directed to abuse@att.net.
Where possible, include details that would assist AT&amp;T in investigating and resolving such complaint (e.g., expanded headers, IP address(s), a copy of the offending transmission and any log files).</p>
DMCA Copyright Notifications:
<p>Pursuant to 17 U.S.C.
§§ 512(b)–(d), a copyright holder may send AT&amp;T a valid notification of claimed copyright infringement under the DMCA.
For further information regarding such notifications, see https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html.
AT&amp;T's designated agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement as described in DMCA subsection 512(c)(3) is:</p>
<p>Registered Copyright Agent<br>
4825 Creekstone Drive, Suite 300<br>
Durham, NC 27703<br>
E-mail: copyright@att.com</p>
<p>Due to the substantial volume of notifications of claimed infringement that AT&amp;T receives and processes, we are unable to accept notices of alleged copyright infringement via this designated agent or email address other than notifications of claimed infringement sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)–(d).</p>
<p>AT&amp;T also provides transitory digital network communications services, pursuant to 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(a).
In connection with such services, AT&amp;T provides an online form that copyright holders should use to send notifications related to alleged copyright infringement by its users based on the standards of the Automated Copyright Notice System (ANCS).
Copyright holders should use this online form to submit complaints related to alleged peer-to-peer file sharing (i.e.
sharing media files via peer-to-peer networking technology), or other forms of copyright notice other than those sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)–(d) of the DMCA ("ISP Conduit Notices").
By submitting complaints using this online form, we are able to more efficiently manage and process ISP Conduit Notices.
Due to the substantial volume of copyright notices that AT&amp;T receives, we are unable to guarantee processing of ISP Conduit Notices that are sent by other means.
Copyright holders can access AT&amp;T's online form at att.com/p2pnotices.
Please note that copyright holders must complete all fields in the online form before submitting.</p>
Contact Information:
<p>Any notification that AT&amp;T sends to its Customers pursuant to this AUP will be sent via e-mail to the e-mail address on file with AT&amp;T, or may be in writing to Customer's address of record.
It is Customer's responsibility to promptly notify AT&amp;T of any change of contact information.</p>
