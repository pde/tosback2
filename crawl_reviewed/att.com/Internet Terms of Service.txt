AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>a.
<i>Service Description.</i>
</b> AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service (referred to as "the Service") is composed of narrowband or broadband access to Internet, and offers you a capability for acquiring or retrieving information from.
generating, storing, transforming, processing, or utilizing information on.
or making available information to other Internet end points connected directly or indirectly to the AT&amp;T network</p>
<p>Because the Internet consists of multiple interconnected networks and most Internet end points (for example, Web sites and other content providers) are not directly connected to the AT&amp;T network, AT&amp;T must connect to and exchange traffic with other networks to provide its subscribers the capability of uploading data to or downloading data from Internet end points that are connected to those networks.
To that end, AT&amp;T has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with such networks on mutually agreeable terms.
Consistent with its longstanding practice, AT&amp;T does not warrant that it will establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks except on such mutually agreeable terms.
To the extent AT&amp;T is unable to reach agreement on terms of interconnection or network expansion with these other networks, it could affect your service.
These impacts on your service performance are described in more detail in the AT&amp;T Open Internet Notice.
AT&amp;T therefore makes no promise, express or implied, that you will be able to upload data to or download data from Internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.</p>
<p>Like the other networks that make up the Internet, the AT&amp;T network is a shared network, which means that the transmission links and other network resources used to provide the Service are shared among the subscribers of AT&amp;T.
AT&amp;T manages this network for the benefit of all users based on a variety of factors, and our technical expertise.</p>
<p>
<b>b.
<i>Speed, Service Capability Speed Ranges, and Conditions that May Impact Service Performance.</i> AT&amp;T offers many broadband service options, each of which has a different service capability speed range.
The term "speed" is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular broadband internet access service can transmit data.
This capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits, megabits, or gigabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps).
Some applications like a short email without attachments or basic Web browsing do not require high service capability speeds to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed services.
Your service capability speed may not be suitable for some applications, particularly those involving real-time or near real-time, high-bandwidth uses such as streaming video or video conferencing.</b>
</p>
<p>The current speed ranges AT&amp;T offers may be found at att.com/speedtiers, which identifies the downstream and upstream rates at which your line transfers internet access data between the network interface device at your home, office, or apartment building to the point you connect to the AT&amp;T network.
Our wired broadband Internet access customers should expect to see service capability speeds within the speed tier of their service plan.
For example, a customer with AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Elite Service should expect service capability download speeds between 3.1Mbps and 6Mbps between the network interface device at your premises and the point at which you connect to the AT&amp;T network.
The high-end of this range represents expected maximum speed capabilities.
For more information about how AT&amp;T helps transmit your information to points on the Internet, how AT&amp;T manages the network, broadband options such as different service capability and expected and actual speed ranges, device attachment rules, activities which may impair or degrade your internet experience, and for additional information regarding network practices with respect to data usage caps related to AT&amp;T Broadband Internet access services, please visit att.com/broadbandinfo.</p>
<p>Because service performance varies on an end-to-end basis, the service capability speeds of AT&amp;T are limited to, and measured between, your location and a point on the AT&amp;T network, which constitutes only one segment of the end-to-end transmission path connecting the end user to Internet Web sites or content providers.
End-to-end performance of your Service depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to): the number of subscribers simultaneously using the network.
customer location.
destination and traffic on the Internet.
Wi-Fi connectivity.
interference with high frequency spectrum on your telephone line.
wiring inside your premises, office or apartment.
the capacity or performance of your devices or modem.
the server with which you are communicating.
internal network management factors (including Overhead, which refers to the various control and signaling data required to achieve the reliable transmission of Internet access data).
and, the networks you and others are using when communicating.
In addition, your use of other AT&amp;T services (such as U-verse video, Voice, Unified Messaging, and other services) that share the capacity of your broadband connection with the Service may impact the amount of capacity available for your use of the Service at that particular time and thus affect the performance of the Service.
Consequently, AT&amp;T does not guarantee the performance of your service on an end- to-end basis.</p>
<p>
<b>c.
<i>IP Addresses</i>
</b>.
AT&amp;T High Speed Internet and AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet Services are provided with a dynamic Internet Protocol ("IP") address, a static IP address, multiple static IP address service (as applicable), or a privately managed IP address utilizing CGN (Carrier Gateway NAT) technology, at the sole discretion of AT&amp;T.
Static IP addresses are not available with all speeds.
The dynamic IP address is a single Internet address intended for use with a single Member Account and any associated Sub Accounts.
The static IP address or multiple static IP address is intended for use with a single computer or a network of computers and/or servers.
You may not use the Service in a manner that is inconsistent with these intended uses.
AT&amp;T High Speed Internet services will support both IPV6 and IPV4 Internet addresses.
however, to reach IPv6-exclusive Internet content, some of your equipment may require upgrades or replacement.
AT&amp;T Dial service will support Web sites that utilize IPV4, but it will not support IPV6- only Web sites.
For more information about IPv6 and how it affects you, visit att.com/ipv6.</p>
<p>
<b>d.
<i>Availability.</i>
</b> The Service is not available in all areas, and may not be available at certain speeds (or at all) at your location, even if our initial testing indicated that your line qualified for a particular speed or Service.</p>
<p>
<b>e.
<i>Service/Site Changes.</i>
</b> AT&amp;T reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or Site (including rates and charges), temporarily or permanently.
If AT&amp;T makes a change that would have a material impact on your Service, AT&amp;T will give you notice.
The terms and conditions for temporary changes, if any, will be included in the notice and incorporated by reference into this Agreement at: att.com/temporaryterms.
Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of the changes and the associated terms and conditions.
In lieu of notice and Web site posting, AT&amp;T may instead, at its sole discretion, require customers to enter into an agreement with AT&amp;T regarding temporary material changes.</p>
<p>
<b>f.
<i>Conversion from DSL to U-verse High Speed Internet.</i>
</b> When AT&amp;T is able to provision U-verse High Speed Internet Service at your location, we may, in our discretion, discontinue your DSL service and make available to you AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet at the then applicable U-verse rates, terms, and conditions, which may differ from your previous DSL Service rates, terms, and conditions (including Bundle Discounts).
If you are on a Term Plan and your price will increase as a result of this conversion, you will not have to pay any applicable Early Termination Fee ("ETF") if you elect to cancel DSL Service.</p>
<p>Your new AT&amp;;T U-verse High Speed Internet will require different customer premises equipment ("CPE").
When you are selected for conversion, we will provide at least thirty days' notice of the discontinuation or suspension of your service via email, direct mail, bill page message, or bill insert.
Thirty days after such notice, we may at our sole discretion, either disconnect your service or temporarily suspend your service for up to fifteen days.</p>

DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITH AT&amp;T BY BINDING ARBITRATION</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b>
</p>
<p>Consumer Customers: See Arbitration sections below.
Business Customers: See Schedule 1.</p>
<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 800.288.2020.
<b>In the unlikely event that the AT&amp;T customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
<b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration.
Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>
<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
<u>Arbitration Agreement</u>
</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>a.
AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b> between you and AT&amp;T.
This arbitration agreement does not include claims against Yahoo!, or claims against AT&amp;T or Yahoo! that are based in whole or in part on the Site.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory</li>
<li>Claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising)</li>
<li>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class</li>
<li>Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>References to "AT&amp;T," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service or Site under this or prior Agreements between us.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
<b>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AT&amp;T ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</b> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>b.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address").
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled.</p>
<p>
<b>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from here:</b> att.com/arbitration-forms.</p>
<p>c.
After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000.
(The filing fee currently is $200, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.
If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address).
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
(You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.
Unless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>
<p>d.
If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the last written settlement offer made by AT&amp;T before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay you the greater of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater.
and</li>
<li>Pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>e.
The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.
Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.
However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or costs.
Although under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.</p>
<p>f.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

<i>Inside Wire.</i>

<p> </p>
<p>
<b>5.
<i>Arbitration Agreement:</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and you ("We") agree to resolve all disputes between us through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this provision.</p>
<p>This agreement to arbitrate is broad, and includes disputes of any type between AT&amp;T (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, predecessors, successors, and assigns) and you (including authorized or unauthorized users/beneficiaries of services or devices) under this or prior agreements.
<b>We agree that WE are waiving the right to a trial by jury, to participate in a class action, or to seek remedies beyond the extent necessary to provide individualized relief to, and affecting only, AT&amp;T or You alone.
WE AGREE NOT TO ACT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED OR DE FACTO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.</b> Except for matters relating to arbitrability or to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or the interpretation of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, and non-individualized relief, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide.</p>
<p>A party seeking arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
Notice to AT&amp;T must be addressed to: Office of Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address").
The Notice must: (a) describe the basis of the claim or dispute.
(b) describe the specific relief sought ("Demand").
and, (c) provide your AT&amp;T account number.
If We do not resolve the claim within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, either of us may commence an arbitration.
The amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount of any award on the merits.</p>
<p>Unless We agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.
AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for a claim brought by AT&amp;T or for a claim or Demand valued at up to $25,000 brought by You.
If the arbitrator finds that your claim or Demand is frivolous or is brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA rules and You agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for fees already paid by AT&amp;T that are your obligation under the AAA rules.</p>
<p>If you complied with the notice procedures above.
the value of your claim or Demand is $25,000 or less.
and the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than the value of AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or any amount if AT&amp;T made no offer), AT&amp;T will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay you the award or $10,000, whichever is greater ("Alternative Payment").
and,</li>
<li>Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("Attorney Award").</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The arbitrator may rule on the payment of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and Attorney Award during the proceeding and within 14 days after his/her final ruling on the merits.
In assessing whether the award is greater than the value of the last written settlement offer by AT&amp;T, the arbitrator may consider only those attorneys' fees or expenses that you incurred through the date of your Notice and which had been awarded to You.
You may also recover attorneys' fees and expenses under applicable law, but you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or expenses.</p>
<p>This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act governs.
This arbitration provision survives termination of this Agreement.
As the exclusive alternative to arbitration, AT&amp;T or you may commence an individual action in Small Claims Court.
If a court rejects enforcement of any of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, or non- individualized relief as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, We agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (except a change to the Notice Address) during your Service commitment, you may reject any such change by sending AT&amp;T written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address.
By rejecting any future change, You agree to arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
<p>If you are located in Puerto Rico, in addition to pursuing arbitration in accordance with this provision, you may notify the Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico of your grievance.
