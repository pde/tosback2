</ul>   Twitter Privacy Policy <p>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.
We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.<br>
<br>
That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.</p> You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you take away from it: <p>Twitter is public and Tweets are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world.
We give you non-public ways to communicate on Twitter too, through protected Tweets and Direct Messages.
You can also use Twitter under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.</p>
<p>When you use Twitter, even if you’re just looking at Tweets, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you’re using and your IP address.
You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile.
We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant Tweets, people to follow, events, and ads.</p>
<p>We give you control through your settings to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it, and to control things like account security, marketing preferences, apps that can access your account, and address book contacts you’ve uploaded to Twitter.
You can also download information you have shared on Twitter. </p>
<p>In addition to information you share with us, we use your Tweets, content you’ve read, Liked, or Retweeted, and other information to determine what topics you’re interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content.
We give you transparency into that information, and you can modify or correct it at any time.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to hear from you.
You can contact us at any time.</p>   <p> 1 </p> Information You Share With Us <p>

If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you.
On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number.
Your display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.
You can also create and manage multiple Twitter accounts<sup>1</sup>, for example to express different parts of your identity.<br>

</p> Close tooltip   <p>1.2</p> Public Information <p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your profile information<sup>2</sup>, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from.
You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile.
The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public.
If you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach.
Periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions.
So are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay.
Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope.
Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public.
For example, other people may tag you in a photo<sup>3</sup> (if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.
If you update your public information on Twitter, such as by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android.</p>
<p>By publicly posting content when you Tweet, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same.
To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Tweets to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter.
We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access.
We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms.
But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter.

We also use contact information to enable certain account features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads.
If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow.
Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter.
You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>
<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you.
We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.</p>
<p>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your Periscope account to these other services.
If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address, friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.
You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>
<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.</p>   <p>1.4</p> Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications <p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content.
For example, you can use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on Periscope.
When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them.
This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co URLs, detection of spam<sup>4</sup>, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues.
We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content.
We share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to.
we do not use them to serve you ads.
Note that if you interact in a way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet, those interactions will be public.
When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy<sup>5</sup> of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>

This includes links in emails we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.</p>
<p>If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach.
They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.</p>   <p>2.3</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services.
Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles.
Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer<sup>7</sup>.
However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences.

For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about you.
This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information.
We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.
We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance.
For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services.
We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.</p>

We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter.
Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app.
Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info.
In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health.
Learn more about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising services.

We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke this permission at any time from your application settings.
for other integrations, please visit the other service you have connected to Twitter.</p>   <p>2.9</p> Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity <p>When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication, security, and personalization.
Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that information with your Twitter account.
Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to Twitter.
We do this to operate and personalize our services.
For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email addresses containing those components.</p>

<p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services.
For example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of our advertising business. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in this way by using the “Share your data with Twitter’s business partners” option in your Personalization and Data settings.
