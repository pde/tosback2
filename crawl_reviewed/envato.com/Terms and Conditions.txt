</ul>Welcome to Envato Market <p>1.
Hi, we’re Envato and welcome! We’re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay.
When we say ‘<strong>we</strong>’, ‘<strong>us</strong>’ or ‘<strong>Envato</strong>’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the <strong>Envato Market</strong> sites.
</p>
<p>2.
Envato’s ecosystem of digital marketplaces helps millions of people around the world get creative and earn online.
When you create an account and accept these terms you become a <strong>member</strong> of our community.
You will have an <strong>Envato Market account</strong> that will allow you to buy and sell <strong>items</strong> like the ones found on the Envato Market sites and make other related transactions.
</p>
<p>3.
The Envato Market sites are platforms that allow members to buy and sell licenses to use digital items like website themes, production music, motion graphics project files, software code, vectors, images and much, much more.
Envato Market facilitates transactions between us, buyers and authors via a <strong>payment method</strong>.
Any transactions are logged on your member’s statement, which records the payments made by you to authors via Envato (as a <strong>buyer</strong>) and by buyers via Envato to you (as an <strong>author</strong>).
</p>
<p>4.
The items on Envato Market are owned by the authors, not by us.
We provide a platform.
we do not take ownership of the items or get any rights to use the items other than to make them available on and promote our sites.
</p>
<p>5.
During your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in these terms so please read and understand them.
If you don’t accept the terms then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because your presence on and use of the Envato Market sites is conditional on your acceptance to be bound by these terms and the Privacy Policy whether you become a member or not.
</p> How browsing and membership works <p>6.
<strong>Browsing</strong>: You need to be 13 years or over to browse the Envato Market sites.
We don’t knowingly collect any information from anyone aged 13 or under.
When browsing the sites you agree to follow our guidelines or instructions and keep in mind that these terms apply to any use of our sites whether or not you’re a member.
</p> Membership <p>7.
<strong>Age</strong>: You need to be 18 years or over to become a member.
If you’re under 18 you will need to be under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age, and this adult will be responsible for all your activities.
</p>
<p>8.
<strong>Benefits</strong>: Membership is free.
When you become a member you get an Envato Market account that is accessible from any of our Envato Market sites (and is also your Envato account for other Envato services).
Your membership will allow you to ‘buy’ (license) items from authors, participate in our online forums, and generally contribute to our ecosystem of sites that help people get creative.
Membership also gives you the opportunity to become an author (see <strong>section 28 – Becoming an Author</strong>) and earn referral income (see <strong>section 10 – Referrals</strong>).
</p>
<p>9.
<strong>Your responsibility</strong>: You promise that information you give us is true, accurate and complete and that you will keep your account information up-to-date (including a working email address).
Your membership is not transferrable.
You are responsible for any use of the Envato Market sites that occurs in conjunction with your username and password so keep your password secure and don’t let any other person use your username or password on your behalf.
If you realise there’s any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security you need to let us know immediately.</p> It is important that you understand your responsibilities as a member of our community so please take the time to review this section and the Envato Market Terms carefully.
<p>10.
<strong>Referrals</strong>: As a part of our Affiliate Program, if you refer a new member to any of our Envato Market sites you will be eligible to receive affiliate income.
You can find out more about the Affiliate Program and the terms applying to referrals here.
</p> How buying items works This section will help you understand what you are buying when you purchase an item and how that transaction takes place on Envato Market.
<p>11.
The total price you’ll pay for an item on Envato Market is made up of several components including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Item Price</strong>: When you ‘buy’ an item, you’re paying a price to the author for the right to use that item.
you’re not actually buying the item itself.
What you get includes a license directly from the author to use that item.
Items are subject to specific terms of use, and these terms are the ‘license’ that we set on behalf of authors.
Different license types are available for you to choose when you have selected an item.
You’ll need to think about the way you want to use the item so that you can pick the right license to allow that use.
It’s your responsibility to choose the correct license for your requirements.
For the different types of licenses and what they mean see our licensing page.
This links to our licensing resources, and if you still have a licensing question you can open a support ticket.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Buyer Fee</strong>: When you ‘buy’ an item you’re also paying a price for the services you get from Envato like 24/7 buyer support, fraud protection, item quality control and other related buyer services.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Handling Fee</strong>: In some transactions on Envato Market the total price you pay may include a handling fee.
See section 16 below for details about the handling fee.
You can read more about the awesome buyer services you get from us over at Why Buy From Us information page.
</li>
</ol>Transacting as a Buyer: <p>12.
You can make payments in one of two ways: you can ‘buy it now’ or you can buy Envato credits via your Envato Market account.
</p>
<p>13.
<strong>Envato credits</strong>: When you deposit money into your Envato Market account it is converted by your financial institution from your currency to US Dollars.
We then convert those US Dollars to Envato credits.
Envato credits are the virtual currency on Envato Market and one (1) Envato Credit is equal to one (1) US Dollar.
</p>
<p>14.
Envato credits can only be used to pay for Envato Market transactions.
We do not generally refund any monies deposited to your Envato Market account to buy Envato credits (but you may have rights under an applicable consumer law, which we don’t exclude).
</p>
<p>15.
If you choose to buy using Envato credits, the total price you pay will be deducted from your Envato credits.
</p>
<p>16.
If you choose to buy using a method that is not Envato credits you will be redirected to a payment method provider (a ‘*<em>payment agent</em>’), and you may be required to pay a handling fee charged over the item price.
</p>
<p>17.
<strong>Currency conversion costs</strong>: You are responsible for all costs of currency conversion relating to your Envato Market account.
Your financial institution does the currency conversion and may charge you additional fees (we don’t control either the conversion rates or your financial institution’s fees).
</p> This means that you may incur additional costs when purchasing from Envato Market, which we have no control over.
<p>18.
<strong>Terms of buying</strong>: When you buy an Envato Market item you’re doing so on the following terms:
</p>
<ol>
<li> you promise to us and the author that you have carefully considered the suitability of your chosen license, and that you have chosen appropriately.
</li>
<li> you cannot cancel a completed purchase of an item.
</li>
<li> we and the authors do not promise that any particular item will continue to be available on Envato Market so you should download and save the item as soon as you buy it.
</li>
<li> once you purchase an item and you pay the item price, you acquire a non- exclusive license to use the item under the terms set out in the license (non-exclusive means others might also license the same item).
</li>
<li> the author retains ownership of the item.
</li>
<li> we have the right to enforce against you the terms of the license that you have acquired from an author.
</li>
</ol> It is important that you understand the terms on which you are making a purchase.
Please take the time to review this section carefully.
<p>19.
<strong>What authors promise you about items</strong>: The author of an item you buy promises you that:</p>
<ol>
<li> they own or have rights to use the intellectual property rights in that item and that item does not infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party.
</li>
<li> the item is not false, inaccurate, misleading, fraudulent, unlawful or defamatory.
</li>
<li> the item does not violate any applicable law or regulation (including those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, criminal law, pornography, anti-discrimination, trade practices or fair trading).
</li>
<li> the item does not contain viruses or other computer codes, files or programs which are designed to limit or destroy the functionality of other computer software or hardware.
</li>
</ol> This is what authors are promising you when you buy an item.
<p>20.
<strong>Taxes, fees and charges</strong>: You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with your use of our Envato Market sites wherever levied (including withholding tax, if applicable).
We may collect geographical location information to determine your location, which may be used for tax purposes (so location information you give us must be accurate for tax residency purposes).
</p>
<p>21.
<strong>Envato credits expire</strong>: Envato credits expire if not used within 12 months from the date of deposit, and will be forfeited on the 12 month anniversary of the deposit date.
If you deposit money to your Envato Market account at any time during that 12 month period before your Envato credits expire, the total balance of your Envato credits (that is, both the new deposit and the balance of any unused older Envato credits) will become available for a further 12 months from the date of the new deposit.
If you don’t use your Envato credits within that further 12 months, the credits will be forfeited on the 12 month anniversary of the new deposit.
We generally try to tell you beforehand when Envato credits are going to expire and be forfeited, but this is not always possible and we’re not obliged to warn you.
Check your member’s statement regularly for details of expiry dates.
If you have different rights under an applicable consumer law, we don’t exclude them.
</p> If you haven’t used your Envato credits within 12 months they may expire.
<p>22.
<strong>Items with an incorrect price or incorrect information</strong>: Despite our reasonable efforts, items may occasionally be listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information.
If this happens, we may cancel or reverse a transaction, even after it is completed and a payment has been processed.
If we do this, we’ll promptly arrange for any payment to be credited or refunded and you must not use the item.
</p> Refunds <p>23.
Given the nature of downloadable digital items, we do not generally offer a refund or credit on a purchase unless required under Australian consumer law or other relevant consumer protection laws.
If you would like to request a refund or credit on a purchase, you should open a support ticket.
</p>
<p>24.
We will assess refund or credit requests on their merits, considering the digital nature of Envato Market items and the type of item preview that was available before purchase.
There is no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li> you have changed your mind about an item.
</li>
<li> you bought an item by mistake.
</li>
<li> you do not have sufficient expertise to use the item.
</li>
<li> you ask for goodwill.
or </li>
<li> you can no longer access the item because it has been removed by its author from Envato Market (we advise you to download items as soon as you buy them to avoid this situation).
</li>
</ol>
<p>25.
If we decide to issue a refund or credit, this will be done using the same manner used to make the purchase.
So if the item was bought using Envato credits, you will be given credit in Envato credits.
if the item was bought using a particular payment method you will be refunded using the same payment method in reverse.
Any payment made to you (not Envato credits) will be made in US Dollars, under the rules of the payment method (see <strong>section 17 - Currency conversion costs</strong> about currency conversion back to your local currency).
</p> It is important that you understand how refunds work on Envato Market.
<p>26.
<strong>Disputes lodged with payment agents</strong>: If, as a buyer, you lodge a dispute with a payment agent, this will result in a freezing of your Envato Market account until the dispute raised with the payment agent has been closed.
This makes it very complex to resolve any related issues, and means we cannot make payments or issue refunds out of your Envato Market account, so we encourage buyers to contact us directly first to see if we can help resolve any concerns.
</p>
<p> 27.
<strong>Fine print</strong>: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in Australia or elsewhere, your credits are not deposits under Australian law about banks, and that means you don’t get the benefit of any deposit insurance or guarantee under those laws.
We don’t act as a fiduciary or as a trustee for you, and we’re not a licensed financial service provider.
</p> Becoming an Author <p>28.
Imagine creating what you want, when you want, from the comfort of your own home, making passive income whether you’re working or not.
Some of our authors sell stock items in their free time as a hobby, some do it to get their name out there, and some are able to make it their full time profession.
If you want to get involved in our community as an author find out how here.
Remember that if you become an author these terms will continue to apply, along with the Author Terms you’ll sign up to as an author.</p> To find out more about how to become an Author visit the ‘Become an Author’ guide here.

</p>
<p>37.

</p> Linking.
apps made by others <p>38.
<strong>Linking to the Envato Market</strong>: We’d be delighted if you decide to link to Envato Market from other sites, but you have to link to a full version of a page as seen by someone navigating directly to the Envato Market sites and looks the way we’ve intended and not link directly to an image hosted on the Envato Market.
That includes no “in-line” linking methods resulting in images hosted on the Envato Market being displayed on other sites.
You must not “frame” any Envato Market pages by surrounding those pages with someone else’s content, materials or branding.

<p>40.

we’re not able to warrant or endorse those applications and disclaim liability relating to these applications.

But we do reserve the right, based on our reasonable discretion, to determine whether or not your use of the Envato Market complies with these terms.
We can suspend or terminate your Envato Market account at any time for any reason (acting reasonably of course), including if you don’t comply with these terms.
If we do decide to permanently terminate your Envato Market account you must not apply for a new account as unfortunately you will no longer be welcome in our community.

Neither you nor us can bind each other in any way.
