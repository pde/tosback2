Community Guidelines Last Modified: 2018-08-27<p> As a global platform for creativity and self-expression, Tumblr is deeply committed to supporting and protecting freedom of speech.
At the same time, we draw lines around a few narrowly defined but deeply important categories of content and behavior that jeopardize our users, threaten our infrastructure, and damage our community.</p>What Tumblr is for:<p> Tumblr celebrates creativity.
We want you to express yourself freely and use Tumblr to reflect who you are, and what you love, think, and stand for.</p>What Tumblr is not for:<ul>
<li>
<b>Terrorism.</b> We don't tolerate content that promotes, encourages, or incites acts of terrorism.
That includes content which supports or celebrates terrorist organizations, their leaders, or associated violent activities.
Report terrorism</li>
<li>
<b>Hate Speech.</b> Don't encourage violence or hatred.
Don't post content for the purpose of promoting or inciting the hatred of, or dehumanizing, individuals or groups based on race, ethnic or national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, disability or disease.
If you encounter content that violates our hate speech policies, please report it.
Report hate speech Keep in mind that a post might be mean, tasteless, or offensive without necessarily encouraging violence or hatred.
In cases like that, you can always block the person who made the post—or, if you're up for it, you can express your concerns to them directly, or use Tumblr to speak up, challenge ideas, raise awareness or generate discussion and debate.
</li>
<li>
<b>Harm to Minors.</b> Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor.
Don't post or solicit anything relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent.
Don't bully minors, even if you are one.
Being a teenager is complicated enough without the anxiety, sadness, and isolation caused by bullying.
Report harm to minors</li>
<li>
<b>Promotion or Glorification of Self-Harm.</b> Don't post content that actively promotes or glorifies self-harm.
This includes content that urges or encourages others to: cut or injure themselves.
embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders.
or commit suicide rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or joining together in supportive conversation with those suffering or recovering from depression or other conditions.
Dialogue about these behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult conditions.
We aim for Tumblr to be a place that facilitates awareness, support and recovery, and we will remove only those posts or blogs that cross the line into active promotion or glorification of self-harm.
Report self-harm</li>
<li>
<b>Unmarked sensitive content.</b> Tumblr is common ground for millions of people from a wide variety of locations, cultures, and backgrounds.
Some of them are okay with seeing sensitive content on their dashboard, and some aren't, and that’s fine—that's what Safe Mode is for.
While we attempt to automatically categorize content that might not be suitable for all viewers, you can help us respect the choices of people in the community by preemptively marking any sensitive material you post.
<ul>
<li> If you're thinking about posting something that contains sensitive content, please flip the <b>"Mark as sensitive"</b> switch before publishing it (you'll see that switch in the post form).
Some examples of sensitive content might include nudity in an artistic, educational, or photojournalistic context.
</li>
<li> If you regularly post sexually explicit material, we ask that you mark your Tumblr as <b>"Explicit"</b> (which you can do on your blog's settings page).
</li>
</ul> Marking your posts or your blog won't prevent you or the people who look at your posts from using any of Tumblr's features—it just helps other Tumblr users avoid seeing content they might not be comfortable with.
</li>
<li>
<b>Violent Content and Threats, Gore and Mutilation.</b> Don't post content which includes violent threats toward individuals or groups - this includes threats of theft, property damage, or financial harm.
Don't post violent content or gore just to be shocking.
Don't showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals (including bestiality), or their remains.
Don't post content that encourages or incites violence, or glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.
Report violent threatsReport gore and mutilation.</li>
<li>
<b>Uploading Sexually Explicit Video.</b> You can embed anything in a Tumblr post as long as it's lawful and follows our other guidelines, but please don't use Tumblr's Upload Video feature to upload sexually explicit video.
We're not in the business of hosting adult-oriented videos (and it's fucking expensive).
</li>
<li>
<b>Non-Genuine Social Gesture Schemes.</b> Don't participate in schemes to drive up non-genuine Follows, Likes, Reblogs, etc.
Don't orchestrate or engage in "follow trains", where users are encouraged to follow lists of other users to gain more followers for themselves.
Don't make bulk or indiscriminate use of messaging features, like Fan Mail or Asks, to, for example, bait Reblogs/Follows or drive traffic to your blog or website.
If you want people to like you, just play it cool and be yourself.
</li>
<li>
<b>Deceptive or Fraudulent Links.</b> Don't post deceptive or fraudulent links in your posts.
This includes giving links misleading descriptions, putting the wrong “source” field in a post, setting misleading click-through links on images, or embedding links to interstitial or pop-up ads.
</li>
<li>
<b>Misattribution or Non-Attribution.</b> Make sure you always give proper attribution and include full links back to original sources.
When you find something awesome on Tumblr, reblog it instead of reposting it.
It's less work and more fun, anyway.
When reblogging something, DO NOT inject a link back to your blog just to steal attention from the original post.
Report misattribution or non-attribution</li>
<li>
<b>Username/URL Abuse or Squatting.</b> Tumblr's usernames/URLs are meant for the use and enjoyment of all of our users.
Don't squat, hoard, amass, accumulate, accrue, stockpile, rack up, buy, trade, sell, launder, invest in, ingest, get drunk on, cyber with, grope, or jealously guard Tumblr usernames/URLs.
</li>
<li>
<b>Account Dormancy.</b> Use Tumblr! Use Tumblr all the time! Or at the very least, use Tumblr once a year.
If you don’t, we may mark your account as dormant.
Your content won't go anywhere—it'll be archived exactly as you left it—but your URL(s) will be released for someone else to use.
</li>
<li>
<b>Spam.</b> Don't spam people.
Don't make spammy posts, don't post spammy replies, don't send people spammy messages.
Be a regular human.
Don't put tags on your posts that will mislead or deceive searchers.
For example, don't tag a photo of your cat with "doctor who" unless the name of your cat is actually Doctor Who, and don't overload your posts with #barely #relevant #tags.
Of course, meaningful uses of tags are always fine (for example, ironic "punchline" tags that add meaning or context to a post).
Don't put dubious code in your posts, like using JavaScript to cause redirects or inject unwanted ads in blogs.
Don't use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or create blogs with the primary purpose of affiliate marketing.
Spam doesn't belong on Tumblr.
</li>
<li>
<b>Mass Registration or Automation.</b> Don't register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or programmatically.
</li>
<li>
<b>Unauthorized Contests, Sweepstakes, or Giveaways.</b> Please follow our guidelines for contests, sweepstakes, and giveaways.
</li>
<li>
<b>Themes Distributed by Third Parties.</b> To ensure the safety and stability of our blog network, it's important that themes are distributed through tumblr.com/themes.
It's easy, it's secure, and any interested developer can use it to host and promote their work.
Besides the inconvenience involved in using them, third-party theme repositories are often used to inject nefarious code that subjects users to spam, ads, or phishing attacks.
Don't use them.
Creating blogs or directories that curate themes from tumblr.com/themes is a-okay.
</li>
<li>
<b>Copyright or Trademark Infringement.</b> Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others.
If you aren't allowed to use someone else's copyrighted or trademarked work (either by license or by legal exceptions and limitations such as fair use), don't post it.<br>
<br> Intellectual property is a tricky issue, so now is as good a time as any to explain some aspects of the process we use for handling copyright and trademark complaints.
We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
please see our DMCA notification form to file a copyright claim online.
Please note that we require a valid DMCA notice before removing content.
Parties asserting a trademark infringement claim should identify the allegedly infringing work and the legal basis for their claim, and include the registration and/or application number(s) pertaining to their trademark.
Each claim is reviewed by a trained member of our Trust and Safety team.<br>
<br> If we remove material in response to a copyright or trademark claim, the user who posted the allegedly infringing material will be provided with information from the complainant's notice (like identification of the rightsholder and the allegedly infringed work) so they can determine the basis of the claim.<br>
<br> We always want to make sure there is room in any copyright or trademark complaint for both parties to make their case.
With regard to copyright claims, the posting user can file a DMCA counter-notification with us, as described in our Terms of Service.
Counter-notifications that we determine to be valid will result in restoration of the content at issue following the required waiting period prescribed by the DMCA.
With regard to trademark claims, the posting user can send us an appeal explaining their side of the situation, along with any relevant materials we should look at.
A successful trademark appeal will also result in restoration of the content at issue.<br>
<br> With regard to repeat copyright infringement, we use a three-strike system to evaluate the standing of a user's account, where, generally, each valid copyright infringement notice constitutes a strike, and three strikes results in the termination of a user's account.
When a user submits a valid DMCA counter-notification, we remove the associated strike from their record.<br>
<br> Whew.
It's a complex process, but one we're proud of, and that we think strikes all the appropriate balances.
Report copyright infringementReport trademark infringement</li>
<li>
<b>Confusion or Impersonation.</b> Don't do things that would cause confusion between you or your blog and a person or company, like registering a deliberately confusing URL.
Don't impersonate anyone.
While you're free to ridicule, parody, or marvel at the alien beauty of Benedict Cumberbatch, you can't pretend to actually be Benedict Cumberbatch.
Report confusion or impersonation</li>
<li>
<b>Harassment.</b> Don't engage in targeted abuse or harassment.
Don't engage in the unwanted sexualization or sexual harassment of others.
If anyone is sending you unwanted messages or reblogging your posts in an abusive way, we encourage you to be proactive and block the hell out of them.
And if someone blocks you, don't attempt to circumvent the block feature or otherwise try to communicate with them.
Just stop.
Report harassment</li>
<li>

Don't post content that violates anyone's privacy, especially personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or unlisted contact information.
