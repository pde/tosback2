</p> Anonymous Usage <p> You may use Nabble without divulging any information beyond what is technologically required to retrieve a web page.
Such usage, however, will limit the availability of certain features, including maintaining an account.
</p> Site Owners <p> A Nabble "site" is a forum, blog, or any other application created on Nabble with its own subdomain.
The user who creates a site owns it and can make the content public or private as he/she sees fit.
